Introduction

What is attachment? Children are considered to be attached if they tend to seek proximity to and contact with a specific caregiver in times of distress, illness and tiredness.1 Attachment to a protective caregiver helps infants to regulate their negative emotions in times of stress and distress and to explore the environment, even if it contains somewhat frightening stimuli. Attachment, a major developmental milestone in the child’s life, remains an important issue throughout the lifespan. In adulthood, attachment representations shape the way adults feel about the strains and stresses of intimate relationships, in particular parent-child relationships, and the way in which the self is perceived.

Development of attachment

Attachment is suggested to develop in four phases.1 In the first phase — indiscriminately orienting and signalling to people — the baby seems “tuned” to certain wave-lengths of signals from the environment. These signals are mostly of human origin (e.g. the sound of voices). During the second phase, probably first by smell and then by sight, the baby develops preference for one or more caregivers — the phase of orienting and signalling to one or several specific persons. Not until the infant is able to show active attachment behaviour, such as actively seeking proximity to and following the attachment figure, does the infant enters the third phase, the phase of attachment proper — staying near a specific person by means of signalling and movement. Children enter the fourth phase of the goal-corrected partnership when they can imagine the parent or caregiver’s plans and perceptions and fit their own plans and activities according to these.

Explaining individual differences in attachment

Ainsworth et al.2 observed one-year-old infants with their mothers in a standardized stressful separation procedure, the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP). The reactions of the infants to their reunion with the caregiver after a brief separation were used to assess how much trust the children had in the accessibility of their attachment figure.

The procedure consists of eight episodes, of which the last seven ideally take three minutes but they have to be curtailed when the infant is crying for more than 15 to 20 seconds. Infants are confronted with three mildly stressful components: an unfamiliar environment, interaction with a stranger, and two short separations from the caregiver.

Three patterns of attachment can be distinguished on the basis of infants' reactions to the reunion with the parent or other caregiver. Infants who focus their attention on the parent and actively seek proximity on reunion, communicate their feelings of stress and distress openly and then readily redirect their attention on the environment and continue exploration are classified as secure (B).  Infants who do not seem to be distressed and ignore or avoid focusing their attention too explicitly on the caregiver after being reunited (although physiological research shows their heightened attention and arousal)3 are classified as insecure-avoidant (A). Infants who exclusively focus their attention on the caregiver and combine strong contact maintenance with contact resistance, or remain inconsolable without being able to return their attention to the environment, are classified as insecure-ambivalent (C). Besides the classic tripartite ABC classifications, Main and Solomon4 proposed a fourth classification, disorganized attachment (D), which is assigned in combination with one of the three organized cateories and is suggested to indicate fearful attention to the caregiver who may be experienced as frightening, frightened or extremely neglecting.

An overview of all American studies with non-clinical samples (21 samples with a total of 1,584 infants, conducted between 1977 and 1990) shows that about 67% of the infants were classified as secure, 21% as insecure-avoidant and 12% as insecure-ambivalent.5 A central issue in attachment theory and research is what causes some infants to develop an insecure attachment relationship while other infants feel secure.

Research Context

The basic model of explaining individual differences in attachment relationships assumes that sensitive or insensitive parenting determines infant attachment (in-)security. Ainsworth2 and colleagues originally defined parental sensitivity as the ability to perceive and interpret children’s attachment signals correctly and respond to these signals promptly and adequately. Lack of responsiveness or inconsistent sensitivity has indeed been found to be associated with insecurity in children, and consistent sensitive responsiveness with secure bonds.6

However, some proponents of the behavioural genetic approach have declared most correlational findings on child development to be seriously flawed because they are based on traditional research designs focusing on between-family comparisons, which confound genetic similarities between parents and children with supposedly shared environmental influences.7 Harris,8 for example, claims that there is an urgent need to radically rethink and de-emphasize the role of parents in child development. Plomin9 more recently argued that parents matter but do not make a difference in shaping their children’s developmental trajectories –except at conception. Despite the prevalence of this  current of thought, attachment theory continues to emphasize the important role of parental sensitivity, for some good reasons.  Twin studies and molecular-genetic studies on attachment security in infancy did not show a substantial genetic component, and randomized intervention studies documented the causal –if not exclusive- role of sensitivity.

Key Research Questions

Crucial research questions explore the heritability of attachment, the causal role of sensitive parenting in the development of infant attachment security, and intergenerational transmission of attachment suggesting a transmission gap. The question of heritability has been addressed in twin studies comparing attachments of mono- and dizygotic twins within the same family. Furthermore, the causal question has been examined in experimental intervention studies designed to enhance parental sensitivity in order to improve the infant attachment relationship. Lastly, studies on attachment representations in parents and their influence on infant attachments as mediated by parental sensitivity address the transmission question.

Recent Research Results

Concerning the heritability question, at least four twin studies on child-mother attachment security using behavioural genetic modelling have been published. Three of the four studies documented a minor role for genetic influences on differences in attachment security and a rather substantial role for shared environment.10,11,12  The fourth study, the Louisville Twin Study,13  investigated the quality of attachment in twin pairs with an adapted separation-reunion procedure originally designed to assess temperament. The large role shared environmental factors play in attachment (about 50% in the Bokhorst et al. study)12 is remarkable. Individual differences in infant attachment relationships are mainly caused by nurture rather than nature, although the bias in each human being to become attached is universal and inborn. Later in the development of attachment genetic differences might become more important, as Fearon and his team showed in a large sample of adolescent twins.14  In search for differences in structural DNA associated with infant attachment we were, however, not able to trace their influence on the level of specific dopaminergic, serotonergic or oxytonergic genes, or on the level of genome-wide (SNP) analyses.15 

Is sensitive parenting the core ingredient of the shared environment? In 24 randomized intervention studies (n = 1,280) conducted before 2003, both parental sensitivity and children’s attachment security were assessed as outcome measures. In general, attachment insecurity appeared more difficult to change than maternal insensitivity. When interventions were more effective in enhancing parental sensitivity, they were also more effective in enhancing attachment security, which experimentally supports the notion of a causal role of sensitivity in shaping attachment.16 Randomized control trials of the past 15 years seem to support this conclusion but a systematic meta-analytic evaluation still is outstanding.

For more than 25 years the hypothesis of intergenerational transmission of attachment has been investigated, with a special emphasis on the so-called transmission gap. The model of intergenerational transmission can be summarized with the proposition that security of  the attachment representation of parents influences the level of their sensitivity to the infant, which in its turn shapes the security of the infant’s attachment to the parent. Although substantial evidence has been found to support this mediational model it still leaves room for complementary mechanisms besides sensitivity because a persistent transmission gap remains visible.17 Closing this gap has been a major challenge, but with the combination of numerous datasets relevant for this issue in an Individual Participant Data (IPD) meta-analytic approach part of the puzzling transmission gap might be bridged.18   

Conclusions

Attachment, the affective bond of infant to parent, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of stress in times of distress, anxiety or illness. Human beings are born with the innate bias to become attached to a protective caregiver. But infants develop different kinds of attachment relationships: some infants become securely attached to their parent, and others find themselves in an insecure attachment relationship. These individual differences are not genetically determined but are rooted in interactions with the social environment during the first few years of life. Sensitive or insensitive parenting plays a key role in the emergence of secure or insecure attachments, as has been documented in twin studies and experimental intervention studies. In the case of attachment theory, the nurture assumption8 is indeed warranted. Numerous findings confirm the core hypothesis that sensitive parenting causes infant attachment security, although other causes should not be ruled out, and the puzzling transmission gap may require complementary mechanisms besides parental sensitivity, e.g. the influence of the wider social context.

Implications for Social Policy

The most important policy and mental-health implication is that parenting does matter and makes a difference for infants’ socio-emotional development. Parents are therefore entitled to receive social support from policy-makers and mental-health workers to do the best job they can in raising their vulnerable children. Sensitive parenting is hard work and does not come naturally to many parents, who have to find their way even if they had quite some positive childhood experiences of their own. It takes a village to raise a child,19 so parents need to rely on good-quality non-parental care in a larger caregiving network to combine childrearing with other obligations. Furthermore, many parents may profit from rather brief preventive interventions that help them become more sensitive to their infants’ attachment signals. From randomized experiments, we may conclude that effective interventions for enhancing sensitive parenting and infant attachment security are now becoming available that use a moderate number of sessions and a clear-cut interactive  focus, starting some six months after birth. From an applied attachment perspective, young parents should be given access to preventive support programs that incorporate these evidence-based insights.

# What is a Secure Attachment? And Why Doesn’t "Attachment Parenting" Get You There? — Developmental Science

photo credit: Emily Dorrien

A few months ago, a young friend of mine had a baby. She began a home birth with a midwife, but after several hours of labor, the baby turned to the side and became stuck. The midwife understood that the labor wouldn’t proceed, so she hustled the laboring Amelie into the car and drove the half-mile to the emergency room while Amelie’s husband followed. The birth ended safely, and beautiful, tiny Sylvie emerged with a full head of black hair. The little family of three went home.

When the baby was six weeks old, Amelie developed a severe breast infection. She struggled to continue breastfeeding and pumping, but it was extremely painful, and she was taking antibiotics.[1] Finally she gave in to feeding her baby formula, but she felt distraught and guilty. “Make sure you find some other way to bond with your baby,” her pediatrician said, adding to her distress.

Fortunately, sleep came easily to Sylvie; she slumbered comfortably in a little crib next to Amelie’s side of the bed. Still, at four months, Amelie worried that the bond with her baby wasn’t forming properly and she wanted to remedy the problem by pulling the baby into bed. Baby Sylvie wasn’t having it. When she was next to her mother, she fussed; when Amelie placed her back in the crib, she settled. Again, Amelie worried about their relationship.

“Amelie” is an amalgam of actual friends and clients I have seen in the last month, but all of the experiences are real. And as a developmental psychologist, I feel distressed by this suffering. Because while each of the practices—home birth, breastfeeding, and co-sleeping—has its benefits, none of them is related to a baby’s secure attachment with her caregiver, nor are they predictive of a baby’s mental health and development.

“Attachment is not a set of tricks,” says Alan Sroufe, a developmental psychologist at the Institute for Child Development at the University of Minnesota. He should know. He and his colleagues have studied the attachment relationship for over 40 years.

Why the confusion about a secure attachment?

Over the last 80 years, developmental scientists have come to understand that some micro-dynamics that take place between a baby and an adult in a caring relationship have a lifelong effect, in very specific ways, on the person that baby will become.

“Attachment,” Sroufe explains, “is a relationship in the service of a baby’s emotion regulation and exploration. It is the deep, abiding confidence a baby has in the availability and responsiveness of the caregiver.”

A secure attachment has at least three functions:

Provides a sense of safety and security

Regulates emotions, by soothing distress, creating joy, and supporting calm

Offers a secure base from which to explore

In spite of the long scientific history of attachment, psychologists have done a rather poor job of communicating what a secure attachment is and how to create one. In the meantime, the word “attachment” has been co-opted by a well-meaning pediatrician and his wife, William and Martha Sears, along with some of their children and an entire parenting movement. The “attachment parenting” philosophy promotes a lifestyle and a specific set of practices that are not proven to be related to a secure attachment. As a result, the movement has sown confusion (and guilt and stress) around the meaning of the word “attachment.” 

The attachment parenting philosophy inspired by the Searses and promoted by an organization called Attachment Parenting International is centered on eight principle concepts, especially breastfeeding, co-sleeping, constant contact like baby-wearing, and emotional responsiveness. The approach is a well-intentioned reaction to earlier, harsher parenting advice, and the tone of the guidance tends to be baby-centered, supportive, and loving. Some of the practices are beneficial for reasons other than attachment. But the advice is often taken literally and to the extreme, as in the case of my “Amelie,” whose labor required hospital intervention and who suffered unduly in the belief that breastfeeding and co-sleeping are necessary for a secure attachment.

Attachment parenting has also been roundly critiqued for promoting a conservative Christian, patriarchal family structure that keeps women at home and tied tightly to their baby’s desires. Additionally, the philosophy seems to have morphed in the public consciousness into a lifestyle that also includes organic food, cloth diapers, rejection of vaccinations, and homeschooling. The Searses have sold millions of books, and they profit from endorsements of products that serve their advice.

“These [attachment parenting principles] are all fine things,” observes Sroufe “but they’re not the essential things. There is no evidence that they are predictive of a secure attachment.”

Sroufe unpacks feeding as an example: A mother could breastfeed, but do it in a mechanical and insensitive way, potentially contributing to an insecure attachment. On the other hand, she could bottle-feed in a sensitive manner, taking cues from the baby and using the interaction as an opportunity to look, talk, and play gently, according to the baby’s communication—all behaviors that are likely to create secure attachment. In other words, it is the quality of the interaction that matters. Now, one might choose breastfeeding for its digestibility or nutrition (though the long-term benefits are still debated), but to imply, as Amelie’s pediatrician did, that bottle-feeding could damage her bond with her baby is simply uninformed.

There is also confusion about what “constant contact” means. Early on, the Searses were influenced by the continuum concept, a “natural” approach to parenting inspired by indigenous practices of wearing or carrying babies much of the time. This, too, might have been taken up in reaction to the advice of the day, which was to treat children in a more businesslike manner. There is no arguing that skin-to-skin contact, close physical contact, holding, and carrying are all good for babies in the first few months of life, as their physiological systems settle and organize. Research also shows that the practice can reduce crying in the first few months. But again, what matters for attachment is the caregiver’s orientation and attunement: Is the caregiver stressed or calm, checked out or engaged, and are they reading a baby’s signals? Some parents misinterpret the prescription for closeness as a demand for constant physical closeness (which in the extreme can stress any parent), even though the Searses do advise parents to strive for a balanced life.

“There’s a difference between a ‘tight’ connection and a secure attachment,” Sroufe explains. “A tight attachment—together all the time—might actually be an anxious attachment.”

And what of emotional responsivity? This, too, has a kernel of truth, yet can be taken too far. It is safe to say that all developmental scientists encourage emotional responsiveness on the part of caregivers: The back-and-forth, or serve-and-return, is crucial to brain development, cognitive and emotional development, the stress regulation system, and just authentic human connection. But in my observation, well-meaning parents can become overly-responsive—or permissive—in the belief that they need to meet every request of the child. While that is appropriate for babies in the first half to one-year year of life (you can’t spoil a baby), toddlers and older children benefit from age-appropriate limits in combination with warmth and love. On the other hand, some parents feel stressed that they cannot give their child enough in the midst of their other responsibilities. Those parents can take some comfort in the finding that even within a secure attachment, parents are only attuned to the baby about 30% of the time. What is important, researchers say, is that the baby develops a generalized trust that their caregiver will respond and meet their needs, or that when mismatches occur, the caregiver will repair them (and babies, themselves, will go a long way toward soliciting that repair). As long as the caregiver returns to the interaction much of the time and rights the baby’s boat, this flow of attunements, mismatches, and repairs offers the optimal amount of connection and stress for a baby to develop both confidence and coping, in balance.

What is the scientific view of attachment?

The scientific notion of attachment has its roots in the work of an English psychiatrist named John Bowlby who, in the 1930s, began working with children with emotional problems. Most professionals of the day held the Freudian belief that children were mainly motivated by internal drives like hunger, aggression, and sexuality, and not by their environment. However, Bowlby noticed that most of the troubled children in his care were “affectionless” and had experienced disrupted or even absent caregiving. Though his supervisor forbade him from even talking to a mother of a child (!), he insisted that family experiences were important, and in 1944 he wrote his first account of his observations based on 44 boys in his care. (Around the same time in America, psychologist Harry Harlow was coming to the same conclusion in his fascinating and heart-rending studies of baby monkeys, where he observed that babies sought comfort, and not just food, from their mothers.)  

Bowlby went on to study and treat other children who were separated from their parents: those who were hospitalized or homeless. He came to believe that the primary caregiver (he focused mainly on mothers) served as a kind of “psychic organizer” to the child, and that a child needs this influence, especially at certain times, in order to develop successfully. To grow up mentally healthy, then, “the infant and young child should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with this mother (or permanent mother substitute) in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment.”

But the attachment figure doesn’t have to be the mother or even a parent. According to Bowlby, babies form a “small hierarchy of attachments.” This makes sense from an evolutionary view: The number has to be small since attachment organizes emotions and behavior in the baby, and to have too many attachments would be confusing; yet having multiples provides the safety of backups. And it’s a hierarchy because when the baby is in need of safety, he or she doesn’t have time to analyze the pros or cons of a particular person and must automatically turn to the person already determined to be a reliable comfort. Research shows that children who have a secure attachment with at least one adult experience benefits. Babies can form attachments with older siblings, fathers, grandparents, other relatives, a special adult outside the family, and even babysitters and daycare providers. However, there will still be a hierarchy, and under normal circumstances, a parent is usually at the top.

In the 1950s, Mary Ainsworth joined Bowlby in England, and a decade later back in the U.S. began to diagnose different kinds of relationship patterns between children and their mothers in the second year of life.[2] She did this by watching how babies reacted in a sequence of situations: when the baby and mother were together, when they were separated, when the baby was with a stranger, and when baby was reunited with the caregiver after the separation. Ainsworth and colleagues identified the first three of the following patterns, and Mary Main and colleagues identified the fourth:

When babies have a secure attachment, they play and explore freely from the “secure base” of their mother’s presence. When the mother leaves, the baby can become distressed, especially when a stranger is around. When the mother returns, the baby expresses her joy, sometimes from a distance and sometimes reaching to be picked up and held (babies vary, depending on their personality and temperament, even within a secure attachment). Then the baby settles quickly and returns to playing.

The mothers who fall into this pattern are responsive, warm, loving, and emotionally available, and as a result their babies grow to be confident in their mothers’ ability to handle feelings. The babies feel free to express their positive and negative feelings openly and don’t develop defenses against the unpleasant ones.

Babies in insecure-avoidant attachments seem indifferent to the mother, act unstressed when she leaves, and exhibit the same behaviors with a stranger. When the mother returns after a separation, the baby might avoid her, or might “fail to cling” when picked up.

The mothers in insecure-avoidant attachments often seem angry in general and angry, specifically, at their babies. They can be intolerant, sometimes punishing, of distress, and often attribute wrong motivations to the baby, e.g., “He’s just crying to spite me.” One study showed that the insecurely-attached babies are just as physiologically upset (increased heart rates, etc.) as securely attached babies when parents leave but have learned to suppress their emotions in order to stay close to the parent without risking rejection. In other words, the babies “deactivate” their normal attachment system and stop looking to their mothers for help.

As toddlers, insecure-avoidant children don’t pay much attention to their mothers or their own feelings, and their explorations of the physical world are rigid and self-reliant. By preschool, these children tend to be more hostile, aggressive, and have more negative interactions overall. Avoidance and emotional distance become a way of dealing with the world, and instead of problem-solving, they are more likely to sulk or withdraw.

Babies with an insecure-ambivalent/resistant attachment are clingy with their mother and don’t explore or play in her presence. They are distressed when the mother leaves, and when she returns, they vacillate between clinging and angry resistance. For example, they may struggle, hit, or push back when the mother picks them up.

These babies are not easily comforted. They seem to want the close relationship, but the mother’s inconsistency and insensitivity undermine the baby’s confidence in her responses. This pattern also undermines the child’s autonomy, because the baby stays focused on the mother’s behavior and changing moods to the exclusion of nearly everything else. In insecure-ambivalent babies, separation anxiety tends to last long after secure babies have mastered it. Longitudinal studies show that these children often become inhibited, withdrawn, and unassertive, and they have poor interpersonal skills.

The last pattern of insecure attachment—which is the most disturbing and destructive—is disorganized attachment, and it was described by Ainsworth’s doctoral student, Mary Main. This pattern can occur in families where there is abuse or maltreatment; the mother, who is supposed to be a source of support, is also the person who frightens the child. Such mothers may be directly maltreating the child, or they might have their own histories of unresolved trauma. Main and her colleague write, “[T]he infant is presented with an irresolvable paradox wherein the haven of safety is at once the source of alarm.”

This pattern can also result when the mother has a mental illness, substance addiction, or multiple risk factors like poverty, substance abuse and a history of being mistreated. Babies of mothers like this can be flooded with anxiety; alternatively, they can be “checked out” or dissociated, showing a flat, expressionless affect or odd, frozen postures, even when held by the mother. Later these children tend to become controlling and aggressive, and dissociation remains a preferred defense mechanism.[3]

How important is attachment? 

“Nothing is more important than the attachment relationship,” says Alan Sroufe, who, together with colleagues, performed a series of landmark studies to discover the long-term impact of a secure attachment. Over a 35-year period, the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaption (MLSRA) revealed that the quality of the early attachment reverberated well into later childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, even when temperament and social class were accounted for.

One of the most important—and, to some ways of thinking, paradoxical—findings was that a secure attachment early in life led to greater independence later, whereas an insecure attachment led to a child being more dependent later in life. This conclusion runs counter to the conventional wisdom held by some people I’ve observed who are especially eager to make the baby as independent and self-sufficient as possible right from the start. But there is no pushing independence, Sroufe found. It blooms naturally out of a secure attachment.

In school, securely attached children were more well-liked and treated better, by both their peers and their teachers. In one study, teachers who had no knowledge of a child’s attachment history were shown to treat securely attached children with more warmth and respect, set more age-appropriate standards, and have higher expectations. In contrast, teachers were more controlling, had lower expectations, got angry more often, and showed less nurturing toward the children with difficult attachments—and who, sadly, had a greater need than the securely attached kids for kindness from adults.

The MSLRA studies showed that children with a secure attachment history were more likely to develop:[4]

A greater sense of self-agency

Better emotional regulation

Higher self-esteem

Better coping under stress

More positive engagement in the preschool peer group

Closer friendships in middle childhood

Better coordination of friendships and social groups in adolescence

More trusting, non-hostile romantic relationships in adulthood

Greater social competence

More leadership qualities

Happier and better relationships with parents and siblings

Greater trust in life

A large body of additional research suggests that a child’s early attachment affects the quality of their adult relationships, and a recent longitudinal study of 81 men showed that those who grew up in warm, secure families were more likely to have secure attachments with romantic partners well into their 70s and 80s. A parent’s history of childhood attachment can also affect their ability to parent their own child, creating a cross-generational transmission of attachment styles.

But early childhood attachment with a parent is not destiny: It depends on what else comes along. For example, a secure preschool child can shift to having an insecure attachment later if there is a severe disruption in the caregiving system—a divorce or death of a parent, for example. But the effect is mediated by how stressed and available the primary attachment figure is. In other words, it’s not what happens, but how it happens that matters. Children who were previously secure, though, have a tendency to rebound more easily.

Sroufe writes in several articles that an insecure attachment is not fate, either; it can be repaired in a subsequent relationship. For example, good-quality childcare that offers emotional support and stress reduction can mitigate a rocky start at home. A later healthy romantic relationship can offset the effects of a difficult childhood. And good therapy can help, too, since some of the therapeutic process mimics the attachment process. Bowlby viewed development as a series of pathways, constrained by paths previously taken but where change is always possible.

Without conscious intervention, though, attachment styles do tend to get passed through the generations, and Bowlby observed that becoming a parent particularly activates a parent’s childhood attachment style. One study looked at attachment styles over three generations and found that the mother’s attachment style when she was pregnant predicted her baby’s attachment style at one year of age for about 70% of cases.

What about parents who might not have gotten a good start in life and want to change their attachment style? There’s good news. Research on adult attachment shows that it is not the actual childhood experiences with attachment that matter but rather how well the adult understands what happened to them, whether they’ve learned some new ways of relating, and how well they’ve integrated their experience into the present. In other words, do they have a coherent and realistic story (including both good and bad) of where they’ve been and where they are now?

Support matters, too. In one of Sroufe’s studies, half the mothers were teenagers, which is usually a stressful situation. Sroufe found that the teenagers with good social support were able to form secure attachments with their babies, but if they didn’t have support, they were unlikely to form a secure attachment.

How to parent for a secure attachment and how to know if it’s working.

“The baby needs to know that they’re massively important,” says Sroufe. “A caregiver should be involved, attentive, sensitive, and responsive.”

“The baby will tell you what to do,” Sroufe explains. “They have a limited way of expressing their needs, so they’re not that difficult to read: If they’re fussing, they need something. If their arms are out, they want to be picked up. And if you misread them, they will keep on signaling until you get it right.” He gives the example of bottle-feeding a baby: “The baby might want a break, and she looks around. What does the baby want? To look around! If the parent misreads and forces the bottle back, the baby will insist, maybe snap her head away, or pull away harder.”

“How can I know if my baby is securely attached?” a client asked me about her six-month old. Clearly observable attachment doesn’t emerge until around nine months, but here are some clues that a secure attachment is underway:

0-3 months:

The baby’s physiology is just settling as the baby cycles quickly among feeding, sleeping, and alert wakefulness. Meeting the baby’s needs at different points in the cycle helps establish stability.

At this point, the baby has no clear preference for one person over another.

In her quiet, alert state, the baby is interested in the faces and voices around her.

4-8 months:

Attempts to soothe the baby are usually effective at calming her down. (Caveat: An inability to soothe might not be predictive of insecurity but rather point to one of a host of other possible issues.)

The primary caregiver has positive interactions with the baby where the back-and-forth is pleasant.

The baby has calm periods where she is interested in the world around her, and she explores and experiments to the extent she is physically able to—looking, grasping, reaching, babbling, beginning crawling, exploring objects with her mouth, hands, etc.

Infants begin to discriminate between people and start to show preferences. They direct most of their emotions (smiles, cries) toward the caregiver but are still interested in strangers.

They are very interested in the people they see often, especially siblings.

9 months:

The baby shows a clear preference for a primary caregiver.

The baby shows wariness toward strangers, though the degree varies with temperament.

The baby is easily upset when separated from her primary caregiver, though that, too, varies with temperament.

The baby is easily soothed after a separation and can resume her exploration or play.

9 months – 3 years:

The child shows a clear emotional bond with a primary person.

The child stays in close proximity to that person but forms close relationships with other people who are around a lot, too, e.g., babysitter, siblings.

Beyond this age, the attachment relationship becomes more elaborated. With language and memory, the rhythms of attachment and separation become more negotiated, talked about, and planned, and there is more of a back-and-forth between parent and child. By toddlerhood and beyond, an authoritative parenting style deftly blends secure attachment with age-appropriate limits and supports. A sensitive parent allows the changing attachment to grow and stretch with a child’s growing skills, yet continues to be emotionally attuned to the child and to protect their safety.

One of the best resources for how to parent for a secure attachment in the first few years of life is the new book Raising A Secure Child by Kent Hoffman, Glen Cooper, and Bert Powell, all therapists who have worked with many different kinds of families for decades. Their work is based squarely on the science of attachment, and they call their approach the Circle of Security. The circle represents the seamless ebb and flow of how babies and young children need their caregivers, at times coming close for care and comfort, and at other times following their inspiration to explore the world around them. The caregivers’ role is to tune into where on the circle their child is at the moment and act accordingly. Parenting for a secure attachment, the authors say, is not a prescriptive set of behaviors but more a state of mind, a way of “being with” the baby, a sensitivity to what they are feeling. The authors also help parents see the ways that their own attachment history shows up in their parenting and help them to make the necessary adjustments.

The neurobiology of attachment

“Attachment theory is essentially a theory of regulation,” explains Allan Schore, a developmental neuroscientist in the Department of Psychiatry at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine. A clinician-scientist, he has elaborated modern attachment theory over the last three decades by explaining how the attachment relationship is important to the child’s developing brain and body.

Early brain development, Schore explains, is not driven just by genetics. The brain needs social experiences to take shape. “Mother Nature and Mother Nurture combine to shape Human Nature,” he writes.

Infants grow new synapses, or neural connections, at a rate of 40,000 new synapses a second, and the brain more than doubles in volume across the first year. Genetic factors drive this early overproduction of neurons, Schore explains, but the brain awaits direction from the social environment, or epigenetic processes, to determine which synapses or connections are to be pruned, which should be maintained, and which genes are turned on or off.

One of the first areas of the brain that begins to grow and differentiate is the right brain, the hemisphere that processes emotional and social information. The right brain begins to differentiate in the last trimester in utero, whereas the left-brain development picks up in the second year of life. Some of the regions that process emotion are already present in infants’ brains at birth—the amygdala, hypothalamus, insula, cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. But the connections among these areas develop in specific patterns over the first years of life. That’s where input from the primary relationship becomes crucial—organizing the hierarchical circuitry that will eventually process, communicate, and regulate social and emotional information.[5]

“What the primary caregiver is doing, in being with the baby,” explains Schore, “is allowing the child to feel and to identify in his own body these different emotional states. By having a caregiver simply ‘be with’ him while he feels emotions and has experiences, the baby learns how to be,” Schore says.

The part of the brain that the primary caregiver uses for intuition, feeling, and empathy to attune to the infant is also the caregiver’s right brain. So it is through “right-brain-to-right brain” reading of each other, that the parent and child synchronize their energy, emotions, and communication. And the behaviors that parents are inclined to do naturally—like eye contact and face-to-face interaction, speaking in “motherese” (higher-pitched and slower than normal speech), and holding—are just the ones shown to grow the right-brain regions in the baby that influence emotional life and especially emotion regulation.

The evidence for epigenetic effects on emotion regulation is quite solid: Early caregiving experiences can affect the expression of the genes that regulate a baby’s stress and they can shape how the endocrine system will mobilize to stress. Caregiving behaviors like responsiveness affect the development of the baby’s vagal tone (the calming system) and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (the system that activates the body to respond to perceived danger). High quality caregiving, then, modulates how the brain and body respond to and manage stress.

Schore points out that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a brain region in the right hemisphere, both has the most complex emotion and stress-regulating systems of any part in the brain and is also the center of Bowlby’s attachment control system. Neurobiological research confirms that this region is “specifically influenced by the social environment.” [6]

Stress management is not the only important part of emotion regulation. In the past, Schore explains, there was an overemphasis in the field of emotion regulation on singularly lowering the baby’s distress. But now, he says, we understand that supporting positive emotional states is equally important to creating [what he quotes a colleague as calling] a “background state of well-being.” In other words, enjoy your baby. It’s protective.

A baby’s emotion regulation begins with the caregiver, and the Goldilocks principle applies: If the caregiver’s emotions are too high, the stimulation could be intrusive to the baby, Schore explains. Too low, and the baby’s “background state” settles at a low or possibly depressive emotional baseline. Just right, from the baby’s point of view is best.

And babies are surprisingly perceptive at registering their feeling environment. Hoffman, Cooper and Powell write:

The youngest babies can sense ease versus impatience, delight versus resentment or irritation, comfort versus restlessness, genuine versus pretending, or other positive versus negative responses in a parent when these reactions aren’t evident to a casual observer. Little babies may pick up on the smallest sigh, the subtlest shift in tone of voice, a certain glance, or some type of body language and know the parent is genuinely comfortable or definitely not pleased.

Schore explains that in a secure attachment, the baby learns to self-regulate in two ways: One he calls “autoregulation” which is self-soothing, or using his own mind and body to manage feelings. The second is “interactive regulation” which is going to other people to help up- or down-regulate feelings. This twin thread of self-reliance and reliance on others, then, begins in the earliest months, becomes very important in the first two years of life, and continues in more subtle ways throughout the life span.

This all might sound daunting for a new parent, who could still be tempted to overdo the focus on the infant and how the connection is going—potentially leading to the same kinds of stress and guilt that the attachment parenting movement creates.

But fortunately, the caregiver doesn’t have to be 100% attuned to the baby and ongoing repairs are an important part of the process:

“The idea that a mother should never stress a baby is problematic,” Schore says. “Insecure attachments aren’t created just by a caregiver’s inattention or missteps. It also comes from a failure to repair ruptures. What is essential is the repair. Maybe the caregiver is coming in too fast and needs to back off, or maybe the caregiver has not responded, and needs to show the baby that she’s there. Either way, repair is possible, and it works. Stress is a part of life, and what we’re trying to do here is to set up a system by which the baby can learn how to cope with stress.”  Optimal stress, he explains, is important for stimulating the stress-regulating system.

Still, both Sroufe and Schore acknowledge the emotional labor of parenting. And they are vehement that parents need to be supported in order to have the space and freedom to care for babies.

“It takes time for parents to learn to read their baby’s signals,” Sroufe said.

Schore calls America’s failure to provide paid family leave—and we’re the only country in the world that doesn’t—the “shame of America.”

“We are putting the next generation at risk,” he explains, pointing to rising rates of insecure attachments and plummeting mental health among American youth. Parents should have at least six months of paid leave and job protection for the primary caregiver, and at least two months of the same for the secondary one, according to Schore, and Sroufe goes further, advocating for one full year of paid leave and job protection. And a recent study showed that it takes mothers a year to recover from pregnancy and delivery.

Intellectual and cognitive development have been privileged in our society, but it is our emotion regulation that organizes us, our existence, and how we experience life, Schore says. A study from the London School of Economics draws the conclusion that “The most important childhood predictor of adult life-satisfaction is the child’s emotional health…. The least powerful predictor is the child’s intellectual development.”[7] 

So where does this leave my friend Amelie?  The hard part will be navigating the distracting advice and creating the workarounds she needs for the lack of cultural support. But she enjoys her baby immensely, and I’m confident that she’ll form a secure attachment with Sylvie, as she trusts her own “right-brain” flow of empathy, feeling, and being, and tunes in to Sylvie’s own unique ways of communicating.

And Sylvie will do her part to draw her parents close. Because regardless of babies’ individual personalities—and whether they cry a lot or sleep very little, whether they’re breastfed or bottle-fed—they draw you in with their wide-open gaze, their milky scent, and their tiny fingers that curl around your big ones. Before you know it, they light you up with their full-body smile that’s specially for you, and they draw you near with their plump little arms clasped around your neck.

And the sweet elixir of the attachment relationship is underway.

# Attachment and child development | NSPCC Learning

Attachment is a clinical term used to describe "a lasting psychological connectedness between human beings” (Bowlby, 1997)1. In particular, attachment theory highlights the importance of a child’s emotional bond with their primary caregivers. Disruption to or loss of this bond can affect a child emotionally and psychologically into adulthood, and have an impact on their future relationships.

Only specially trained and qualified professionals should assess a child’s attachment style. However, it’s important for all adults working with children to understand what attachment is and know how to help parents and carers become attuned to their child’s needs. You might do this by working with them directly, or by signposting families to other appropriate services. In the long term, this can help improve wellbeing and provide positive outcomes for both the child and their caregivers.

Children can form attachments with more than one caregiver, but the bond with the people who have provided close care from early infancy is the most important and enduring (Bowlby, 1997)2.

It’s important that parents and carers are attuned and responsive to their baby’s needs and are able to provide appropriate care. This includes recognising if their baby is hungry, feeling unwell or in need of closeness and affection (Howe, 2011)3.

Forming an attachment is something that develops over time for a child, but parents and carers can start to form an emotional bond with their child before they are born. Sometimes a parent or carer may have difficulty forming this bond, for example if they are experiencing mental health issues or don’t have an effective support network.

The first two years of a child’s life are the most critical for forming attachments (Prior and Glaser, 2006)1.

During this period, children develop an ‘internal working model’ that shapes the way they view relationships and operate socially. This can affect their sense of trust in others, self-worth and their confidence interacting with others (Bowlby, 1997)2.

Attachments are formed in different ways during the phases of a child’s development.

During the antenatal period, parents and carers can form a bond with their child. Any bonds formed before birth can have a positive impact on the relationship between babies and their caregivers once the child is born (Condon and Corkindale, 1997)3.

This is sometimes referred to as the pre-attachment phase because the baby doesn’t appear to show an attachment to any specific caregiver. However, parents and carers who provide a nurturing environment and are responsive to their babies needs can lay the foundation for secure attachments to form (Bowlby, 1997)4.

During this stage of their development, a baby might start to show a preference for their primary and secondary caregivers (often the mother and father).

During this period a child begins to show a strong attachment to their primary caregivers. Babies start to develop separation anxiety during this phase and can become upset when their caregiver leaves, even for short periods (Bowlby, 1997)5.

At this point children are likely to become less dependent on their primary caregiver, particularly if they feel secure and confident the caregiver will return and be responsive in times of need (Bowlby, 1997)6.

A child’s need for attachment is part of the process of seeking safety and security from their caregiver.

In secure caregiver-child relationships, the caregiver is usually sensitive and tuned in to the child’s needs. They are able to provide care that is predictably loving, responsive and consistent.

Young children who have formed a secure attachment to their caregiver may display the following patterns of behaviour during times of stress or exploration:

(Ainsworth et al, 2015)1.

When caregivers react sensitively to ease their child’s distress and help them regulate their emotions, it has a positive impact on the child’s neurological, physiological and psychosocial development (Howe, 2011)2.

Children with secure attachments are more likely to develop emotional intelligence, good social skills and robust mental health (Howe, 2011)3.

Not receiving comfort and security in the early years can have a negative effect on children’s neurological, psychological, emotional and physical development and functioning (Newman, 2015)4.

Babies and young children who have attachment issues may be more likely to develop behavioural problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or conduct disorder (Fearon et al, 2010)5.

Children who have attachment issues can have difficulty forming healthy relationships when they grow up. This may be because their experiences have taught them to believe that other people are unreliable or untrustworthy (Bowlby, 1997)6.

Adults with attachment issues are at a higher risk of entering into volatile relationships and having poor parenting skills, behavioural difficulties and mental health problems (Howe, 2011)7.

Some circumstances can make it more challenging for a child and their caregivers to form a pattern of secure attachment. These may include:

(Bowlby, 1989)1.

Children’s behaviour can be influenced by a wide range of circumstances and emotions. 

Indicators that a baby or toddler might not have a secure attachment with their caregiver will emerge as a pattern of behaviour over time, particularly during moments of stress or exploration. This pattern might include:

(Howe, 2011)2.

As children with attachment issues get older, these behaviour patterns might evolve. As well as being evident during times of stress, some behaviours may start to become obvious at other times. These may include the child:

(Mentally Healthy Schools, 2020)3.

If you think a child may have attachment issues, you should refer them to a suitably trained health and social care professional for a full assessment. You should follow your organisation’s procedures to make a health and social care referral, or contact your local authority children’s social care services.

The signs of attachment issues can be similar to indicators that a child is experiencing other challenges, such as:

This means it’s important to consider everything that’s going on in a child’s life and make sure they and their family are provided with appropriate support.

Think about all your previous experiences with the child and their caregivers, to help you build a clear picture of their relationships and recognise any concerning patterns of behaviour.

Children who have experienced abuse, neglect and trauma might develop coping strategies that can make it more complicated to recognise attachment issues.

For example, one sign of secure attachment is that children see their caregiver as a secure base to explore from. But children who have experienced neglect, for example, might display independent behaviour in order to protect themselves from the emotional pain of not having their needs met (Marvin et al, 2002)1.

It is also possible for a child to develop an attachment to someone who is maltreating them (Blizard & Bluhm, 1994)2.

As well as affecting attachment, experiencing trauma can have an impact on a child’s brain development. Children might need extra support to help strengthen the architecture of their brain.

# The Age of Attachment

FOLLOW US

Ages

Infant-2

"We seem to be living in the 'Age of Attachment,'" writes psychologist  Jean Mercer, author of Understanding Attachment: Parenting, Child  Care, and Emotional Development. Mercer is surprised how often the  term "attachment" comes up in discussions about baby-and-parent bonding.  Yet surprisingly few people really understand this critical concept,  and how it changes over time. "It is the development of attachment that  makes a baby a real human being and prepares him or her to take his or  her rightful place among other humans," says Mercer. "My experience as a  daughter, a mother, and a grandmother is that once understood, the idea  of attachment is of enormous help in understanding family love and  relationships." Â The editors of Scholastic's  Parent & Child talked to Mercer about the importance of  attachment in the early years of life, and to find out how the  transformation from infant to adult happens and what you can do as a  parent to make your relationship grow stronger. Â Parent  & Child: Parents see and hear the word "attachment" a lot â but what  does it really mean?Mercer: Attachment describes the  gradual, evolving changes in a child's feelings toward her parent or  other significant caregiver â and shouldn't be confused with bonding,  which is the process by which the parent falls in love with the child  after birth or adoption. When we say a child is attached, we're saying  she has developed a strong preference for the most important adult or  adults in her life. Unlike bonding, attachment doesn't happen in the  first weeks or months of a child's life. In fact, a baby under 6 months  of age will not have a preference for any particular adult, as long as  she's being well cared for.Â P&C: What happens at 6  months?Mercer: The baby becomes increasingly interested in  social play and interaction. You've seen it: The baby adores  back-and-forth games like peek-a-boo, or any interaction that's  predictable, repetitive, and familiar. Those who spend the most time  with the baby â typically mom and dad, or a close relative or care  provider â get to know what games he likes best, and play these over and  over with him. That's why the baby becomes attached to those people â  they're the ones who provide him with the sort of social interaction he  prefers. Â A bit later, at about the 7- to 9-month mark, you see  signs of the first stage of attachment behavior, when separation anxiety  kicks in. The very reason a baby feels separation or stranger anxiety  is because he's developed an attachment to his primary caregiver. So  much so, that when that person is out of sight, the baby feels the pain  of separation. From this point on, attachment grows in stages, and at  each stage the child gains a greater understanding of how humans  interact and what trust is.Â P&C: When is the next  big stage?Mercer: At around the 15- to 18-month mark, the  child exhibits what's called "secure-base behavior." If you have ever  had a young toddler, you may recall the times you took your child to an  unfamiliar place. You may have noticed that for a while she wanted to  stay quite close to you, either in your lap or at least touching you.  The child is wary, but still wants to explore. So she uses you as her  "secure base." After a while, she ventures out, but she keeps coming  back to check in. She may climb into your lap, or she may just need to  touch you. Still later, she may only need to see you across the room to  feel secure. This is significant because without that base of attachment  to you, your child would not have the security to go out and explore,  and she'd miss the learning opportunities presented by a new situation.Â P&C:  You've noted that a 2 year old's tantrums may signal another stage of  attachment. Can you explain this?Mercer: A child this age  may have tantrums that are actually related to something like separation  anxiety. Let's say you've taken your 2 year old to the pediatrician for  a well visit. It's been a stressful morning, and probably all he wants  is some quiet cuddle time with you. But you, thinking he's okay, decide  to stop at the mall. He's in his stroller, he's in a loud environment,  and he's still kind of stressed out. So he starts crying. And screaming.  Suddenly you've got a tantrum on your hands. Although it looks like bad  behavior, it's important to understand that he's not trying to  manipulate you into buying him a toy or a treat. Instead, the tantrum is  about wanting your attention, wanting you to be that "secure base" for  him. He still has a fear of separation from you. The best thing you can  do for a child this age is to be sensitive to how much stress and  separation â even small separations like being in his stroller at the  mall and not one-on-one with you â he can handle in a day.Â P&C:  There seems to be a pattern regarding attachment â these stages are  triggered by separation from you.Mercer: Yes, that's true.  The same thing happens again by about 2 1/2 to 3 years of age. It's  called "negotiation of separation." This is when you see kids doing some  bargaining. Take, for example, going to bed: You'll start to see  requests for one more story, one more hug, or a glass of water. These  are not manipulation tactics, but ways your child is trying to negotiate  with you. At the very heart of it, what she really wants is all of you,  but she understands on some primitive level that you have other needs: You want to get her to sleep and go spend some time alone or with your  spouse. By asking for another book or cuddle, she's actually making a  big compromise. And when you agree to a certain number of hugs or  stories, you're also compromising. It's yet another learning  opportunity. This time, she's learning that preserving her relationship  with you means making some compromises. She's learning how to have  secure, mutually beneficial relationships with other people.Â P&C:  Parents sometimes worry that a child in day care could have trouble  with attachment. Should they?Mercer: No. The good news is  that it's not as easy as you might think to disrupt attachment. Humans  are wired for it, and every child will form attachments given half a  chance. As long as the child has a relatively stable situation â not a  string of different care providers all the time â his attachment will  develop normally. It's also fine if your child becomes attached to his  care provider; in fact, you want that to happen. This won't disrupt his  attachment to you, as long as you spend some playful, interactive time  with him each day.Â P&C: Do adoptive parents face any  special challenges?Mercer: If you adopt a child under 6  months of age, she has not formed any attachments yet, so you should  never worry that she's missed some sort of window. Also, if you adopt an  older child, presuming he's had attachments to other primary caregivers  earlier in his life, he'll know how to attach and after an adjustment  period he'll be fine.Â P&C: What can disrupt  attachment?Mercer: Traumatic events in a child's life can  interrupt good attachment. Maternal depression is a problem. A depressed  mom is unresponsive, and doesn't offer her child the social interaction  necessary to form good attachment. I'm talking about a severe  depressive episode, not a bad day or even a bad week. An acrimonious  divorce that results in one parent being completely cut out of a child's  life can disrupt attachment, as can an illness or death of a parent. As  dire as these situations can be, there is always an excellent chance of  a full recovery, though it can take a year or more. What the child  needs is another person â another parent or a grandparent â who will  become that steady adult presence in his life.Â P&C:  What can happen in the case of a child who, for whatever reason, has not  been able to form a secure attachment?Mercer: These  children, sadly, may enter adulthood without the ability to trust others  because that's not been modeled for them. They are more likely not to  be trustworthy or reliable themselves. Without that social interaction  that happens throughout the process of attachment, children don't learn  that people can trust one another, which is at the root of human  interaction.

Bowlby's theory on attachment emphasises the key part that the basic carer, i.e. the mother, plays in the emotional development of the child. He believed that children experience one special attachment. That attachment is intrinsic and children, by their nature, attach to the mother in order to stay alive. He believed that attachment needs to happen within a time referred to as the 'crucial period', namely within the first two years of their life. Bowlby stated that what happens during the early months and years of life can have deep and permanent effects If the bond of affection between the child and their mother is broken by separation, this can cause psychological damage e.g. the child could become an offender or face emotional difficulties.

Mary Ainsworth developed a theory on types of attachment. According to Ainsworth, the mother's behaviour towards the child influences the type of attachment that the child experiences. Children with a secure attachment have mothers who respond to their needs. She held an experiment called the Strange Situation. A mother would leave the child on their own in a room with a stranger. The stranger would attempt to interact with the child and the child's behaviour would be observed until the mother returned.

Mae damcaniaeth Bowlby ar ymlyniad yn amlyguâr rhan allweddol maeâr gofalwr sylfaenol, hynny yw y fam, yn ei chwarae yn natblygiad emosiynol plentyn. Credai bod plant yn cael un ymlyniad arbennig. Maeâr ymlyniad hwnnwân gynhenid ac mae plant, wrth natur, yn ymlynu wrth y fam er mwyn aros yn fyw. Credai bod angen i ymlyniad ddigwydd yn ystod yr hyn y galwaiân âcyfnod tyngedfennolâ, sef yn ystod dwy flynedd gyntaf eu bywyd. Meddai Bowlby, âGall yr hyn syân digwydd yn y misoedd aâr blynyddoedd cynharaf mewn bywyd gael effeithiau dwfn a pharhaolâ. Os caiff y cwlwm agosrwydd rhwng y plentyn aâr fam ei dorri drwy wahaniad, gall hyn achosi niwed seicolegol, e.e. gallaiâr plentyn droi at drosedd, neu gael anawsterau emosiynol.

Datblygodd Mary Ainsworth ddamcaniaeth am fathau o ymlyniad. Yn Ã´l Ainsworth, mae ymddygiad y fam tuag at y plentyn yn dylanwadu ar y math o ymlyniad a gaiff y plentyn. Bydd gan blant sydd ag ymlyniad sicr famau sy'n ymateb i'w hanghenion. Cynhaliodd arbrawf a elwir y Sefyllfa Ddieithr. Byddai mam yn gadael y plentyn ar ei ben ei hun mewn ystafell gyda pherson dieithr. Byddai'r person dieithr yn ceisio rhyngweithio gyda'r plentyn a byddai ymddygiad y plentyn yn cael ei arsylwi nes i'r fam ddychwelyd.

Yn Ã´l Ainsworth, bydd plentyn yn syrthio i un o'r mathau o ymlyniad canlynol a bydd yn dangos yr ymddygiadau canlynol:

Attachment refers to the emotional connection between a child and their primary carer which starts at birth, develops quickly between 0 and 2 years and continues to develop throughout their lives. Babies will develop strong attachments to the people who meet their needs regularly during the first months of their lives. The special relationship that develops between a baby and their basic carer during their first year is very important for the child to feel safe. These positive attachments are essential for good emotional development. A child will feel secure and confident when they have a secure attachment with their primary carer, which enables them to develop other social relationships. Secure attachments during childhood lead to happier and healthy attachments in the future.  

The ability to form and maintain relationships is crucial for children as it supports their learning, growth, development and well-being. If babies' emotional needs are met through relationships where there is a strong attachment, they will:

This will lead to the development of a sense of self-worth which is crucial for healthy development. 

Secure attachments help children to manage stress by reducing the impact of childhood disadvantage, e.g. living in a disadvantaged environment. Children living in poverty are more likely to suffer from stress and this can lead to insecure attachments with parents. 

Children who have secure attachments with their main carers are more likely to cope with childhood disadvantage, e.g. living in poverty, or not being able to access health and education services. Developing and maintaining relationships with their main carer helps to support children, e.g. positive behaviour. Babies who develop strong attachments to their main carer are more likely to be well-behaved and have a positive view of themselves and others.

Children who have suffered abuse are likely to have insecure attachments with their primary carers as they have been left on their own without support at anxious times. Insecure attachments may also develop if parents are not consistent with their children, e.g. showing a lot of love one day, and behaving aggressively the next day. If a young child's relationship with their main carer causes them concern, they are likely to struggle with their emotional and social development.

At times, parents or carers will fail to form an attachment with the child due to postnatal depression, premature birth, illness or stress. This may lead to a child struggling to socialise and develop relationships with others, and long-term emotional and social difficulties. When a young child does not have secure attachments, this may lead to trust issues with carers or adults in authority.  They may have problems managing behaviour, as they have not experienced a positive role model.  If a young child does not have a secure attachment, they may not develop the required secure base to support healthy development in the future.

In order to promote attachments between a young child and their primary carer, the following is needed:

Children with insecure attachment avoid or ignore the caregiver and show little or no emotion when the caregiver leaves or returns. This could be a result of inconsistent care from the caregiver.

Mae ymlyniad yn cyfeirio at gysylltiad emosiynol plentyn Ã¢'i ofalwr sylfaenol sy'n dechrau ar adeg geni, yn datblygu'n gyflym rhwng 0 a 2 oed ac yn parhau i ddatblygu gydol oes. Mae babanod yn datblygu ymlyniadau cryf at y bobl syân diwallu eu hanghenion yn rheolaidd yn ystod misoedd cyntaf eu bywyd. Mae'r berthynas arbennig sy'n datblygu rhwng baban aâi ofalwr sylfaenol ym mlwyddyn gyntaf ei fywyd yn bwysig iawn er mwyn i'r plentyn deimlo'n ddiogel. Mae ymlyniadau cadarnhaol yn hanfodol ar gyfer datblygiad emosiynol da. Bydd plentyn yn teimlo'n ddiogel ac yn hyderus pan fydd ganddo ymlyniad diogel gydaâi brif ofalwr ac mae hyn yn ei alluogi i ddatblygu perthnasoedd cymdeithasol eraill. Mae ymlyniadau diogel yn ystod plentyndod yn arwain at ymlyniadau hapusach ac iachach yn y dyfodol.  

Mae'r gallu i ffurfio a chynnal perthnasoedd yn hanfodol i blant gan ei fod yn cefnogi eu dysgu, twf, datblygiad a'u llesiant. Os bydd anghenion emosiynol babanod yn cael eu cwrdd drwy berthnasoedd lle maeâr ymlyniad yn gadarn, byddant yn:

Bydd hyn yn arwain at ddatblygu synnwyr o werth sy'n hanfodol ar gyfer datblygiad iach. 

Mae ymlyniad diogel yn helpu plant i reoli straen gan leihau effaith anfantais plentyndod, e.e. byw mewn amgylchedd difreintiedig. Mae plant sy'n byw mewn tlodi yn fwy tebygol o wynebu straen a gall hyn arwain at ymlyniadau ansicr gyda rhieni/gofalwyr.  

Mae plant sydd ag ymlyniad Ã¢âu gofalwyr sylfaenol yn fwy tebygol o allu ymdopi ag anfantais plentyndod, e.e. byw mewn tlodi, neu fod heb fynediad i wasanaethau iechyd ac addysg. Mae meithrin a chynnal perthnasoedd gydaâu prif ofalwr yn helpu i gefnogi plant, e.e. ymddygiad cadarnhaol. Mae babanod sy'n datblygu ymlyniad cryf i'w prif ofalwyr yn fwy tebygol o fod Ã¢ synnwyr cadarnhaol amdanynt eu hunain ac eraill.

Mae plant sydd wedi dioddef camdriniaeth yn debygol o fod ag ymlyniad ansicr Ã¢âi gofalwyr sylfaenol gan eu bod wedi cael eu gadael ar eu pennau eu hunain a heb gymorth yn ystod cyfnodau pryderus. Gall ymlyniadau ansicr hefyd datblygu os nad yw rhieni/gofalwyr yn gyson Ã¢âu plant, e.e. dangos llawer o gariad un diwrnod a bod yn ymosodol y diwrnod nesaf. Os yw perthynas plant ifanc Ã¢'u prif ofalwyr yn achosi pryder iddynt, maent yn debygol o gael problemau gyda'u datblygiad emosiynol a chymdeithasol.

Ambell waith, bydd rhieni neu ofalwyr yn methu ffurfio ymlyniad gydaâr plentyn oherwydd iselder ar Ã´l geni, genedigaeth gynamserol, salwch neu straen. Gall hyn arwain at blentyn syân ei chael hiân anodd cymdeithasu a datblygu perthnasoedd ag eraill, ac anawsterau emosiynol a chymdeithasol hirdymor. Pan na fydd gan blentyn ifanc ymlyniadau cadarn gall arwain at broblemau ymddiried mewn gofalwyr neu oedolion mewn awdurdod. Efallai bod ganddynt broblemau rheoli ymddygiad, gan nad ydynt wedi cael model rÃ´l cadarnhaol. Os nad oes gan blentyn ifanc ymlyniad cadarn, efallai na fydd yn datblygu'r sylfaen ddiogel angenrheidiol i gefnogi datblygiad iach yn y dyfodol.

Er mwyn hybu ymlyniadau rhwng plentyn ifanc aâi ofalwr sylfaenol, mae angen:

Mae plant ag ymlyniad ansicr yn osgoi neu'n anwybyddu'r rhoddwr gofal heb ddangos fawr ddim emosiwn wrth iddi/iddo adael neu ddychwelyd. Gall hyn fod o ganlyniad i ofal anghyson a roddwyd gan y rhoddwr gofal.

Childcare workers need to support parents/carers, other staff and students when using a variety of methods in order to maintain bonds and encourage secure attachments with children. This entails modelling the use of different methods, for example: 

In order to be an effective childcare worker, reflection techniques should be used to evaluate how practices support the process of developing secure attachments for children. This means that lessons must be learned from experience and practice must be adapted through critical analysis. childcare workers can review their professional practice through realistic and regular assessment of the extent to which their work practice supports secure attachments for children. 

They must have knowledge and understanding of reflective analysis techniques such as:

Feedback from others (other members of staff, parents/carers or the children themselves) is important in terms of learning and development, as it helps childcare workers to become aware of their strengths, as well as areas for improvement. Constructive feedback helps childcare workers to develop their confidence and plan for their future development in order to ensure that they can effectively support secure attachments. Maybe through feedback or by reflecting on practice, childcare workers will identify the need to attend baby massage training in order to support secure attachments. This enables individuals to extend their learning further by reflecting on previous experiences or situations, for example, reflecting on their effectiveness in supporting a new child starting at the setting. Rather than sticking to the same routine, it will enable childcare workers to review their effectiveness in developing attachments with children.

# Dismissive Avoidant Attachment Style: Causes, Traits, and Healing

Those with a dismissive avoidant attachment style may have no desire for close relationships or actively avoid them due to past trauma. 

If you’ve ever taken a deep dive into the psychology of relationships, you’ve probably come across the concept of attachment theory. Attachment theory describes the way that people “attach” to each other in interpersonal relationships based on their life experiences.

Dismissive avoidant attachment is an attachment style in which someone has trouble relying on and forming close emotional bonds with other people.

Dismissive avoidant attachment is a type of insecure attachment, and it’s one of several different attachment styles.

We’ll take a look at some of the causes and traits of dismissive avoidant attachment and discuss ways to heal if you have an avoidant attachment style toward others.

Dismissive avoidant attachment, also known as avoidant attachment, is one of three insecure attachment styles that can affect our relationships with others.

Adults with dismissive avoidant attachment tend to avoid intimacy and closeness with other people, whether that’s parents, partners, or friends. They’re fiercely independent and autonomous and often use defensive techniques to avoid depending on others.

Avoidant attachment is the opposite of anxious attachment, in which people often experience high levels of self-doubt and chase after validation and closeness with others.

When someone has a dismissive avoidant attachment style, they might:

Attachment styles develop from experiences both in childhood, when we’re forming bonds with our parents as babies and children, and later in life.

For example, children with neglected needs during childhood may learn to become more self-reliant, leading to an avoidant attachment style in adulthood. Childhood abuse can also reinforce the fear of closeness, which can manifest as dismissive avoidant attachment.

Avoidant attachment styles may possibly develop from other factors, too such as: 

If you have a dismissive avoidant attachment style, you might prefer to remain independent because it’s what works for you. But maybe you want to enter a long-term relationship or perhaps just improve the relationships you already have.

If you have an avoidant attachment style, here are a few steps you can take toward healing and building better relationships:

Being a parent, partner, or friend to someone with a dismissive attachment style can sometimes be confusing. It may be difficult to understand what they want from you or from the relationship. 

It’s not uncommon for a person with this attachment style to act cold, distant, or even hurtful toward people with whom they are in relationships.

While their behavior is not your fault — or your responsibility to change — there’s nothing wrong with reaching out for support for yourself. If you feel you could benefit from mental health support, here are a few resources to consider checking out:

Dismissive avoidant attachment is one of several attachment styles that affect the way children and adults interact with others. When someone has an avoidant attachment style, they may prioritize their independence and autonomy while struggling to emotionally connect with others.

The dismissive avoidant attachment style is one of the four main attachment styles proposed by attachment theory, which describes the ways individuals form and maintain emotional bonds with others.

People with a dismissive avoidant attachment style typically exhibit a tendency to emotionally distance themselves from others, particularly in close relationships. These individuals often deny the importance of closeness and intimacy, maintain high self-reliance, and disregard or suppress emotional connections due to their defensive dismissal of attachment needs.

The dismissive avoidant attachment style describes a way of relating to other people that is distant, self-reliant, and distrusting.

Individuals with a dismissive avoidant attachment style often value their independence and autonomy above emotional intimacy and connection.

This is often because these individuals were emotionally deprived in childhood and grew up with parents who did not provide enough emotional support and warmth.

Many individuals with a dismissive avoidant attachment style do not consciously experience emotional distance, though. They tend to have busy social lives filled with friends and sexual partners and are often even perceived as confident and content.

But their relationships, social lives, and emotional involvements tend to be shallow — Beneath the self-assured surface lies vulnerability and the belief that they are unworthy of love.

Therefore, it’s important to work towards healing attachment insecurities to build and maintain secure and fulfilling relationships. 

Fortunately, attachment styles are not fixed or permanent traits. They can evolve and change over time, influenced by one’s own self-awareness, personal experiences, relationship dynamics, and commitment to change their beliefs and behaviors.

Dismissive avoidant attachment is characterized by a tendency to avoid or dismiss emotional closeness and connection with others. 

Individuals with this attachment style likely developed this coping mechanism as a result of early experiences and circumstances that led them to believe that relying on others for emotional support is unsafe or unreliable.

However, while they serve a purpose, these coping mechanisms can have a negative impact on a person’s ability to form healthy and stable relationships in adulthood.

Although these beliefs occur mostly on a subconscious level and are activated automatically, they can still be changed. 

To enable you to actively challenge them and turn them into more positive and helpful beliefs, you must first identify and acknowledge them.

To identify maladaptive beliefs and the ensuing avoidant behaviors, it’s helpful to understand your triggers and know when your attachment system has been “switched on.”

Dismissive-avoidants find situations that make them feel out of control, such as conflict or emotional volatility, extremely triggering. They may feel uncomfortable and seek distance when someone becomes dependent on them or expects vulnerability. 

If you grew up learning that other people are not always safe and reliable, you are more likely to develop a dismissive avoidant attachment style. 

That means, when your attachment system is activated, you do not seek other people for their closeness or support, but rather rely on yourself for comfort instead.

You may identify with some of these situations and feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed.

They might trigger you to avoid the person and push them away because you feel you cannot meet their expectations. You might become passive-aggressive or critical, or just avoid them altogether. 

This is the way you have learned to cope with the underlying belief that you are unlovable and defective and that others will eventually abandon you. For you, it is easier and more comfortable to avoid intimacy and dependence.

However, your behavior can be hurtful to others, and you may be missing out on the advantages of intimacy and allowing yourself to be vulnerable with loved ones.

Dismissive avoidant individuals idealize their independence and want to maintain an emotional distance from people, which they achieve by (subconsciously) employing “deactivating strategies.”

They deactivate their need for closeness and comfort to protect themselves from pain and suppress any distressing thoughts, feelings, or memories.

Deactivating strategies are triggered when the attachment system is activated (i.e., when there is an emotional trigger, such as another person wanting to get close).

Dismissive avoidant individuals diminish the importance of closeness and reject others to protect themselves. Unfortunately, this behavior often comes at a cost to other people and the avoidant person themself. 

It is, therefore, worthwhile to heal attachment insecurities and learn to enjoy close connections and intimacy.

To maximize their chances of survival, infants are born with an innate attachment drive. When they are frightened or distressed, their attachment system is activated, which leads to proximity-seeking behaviors towards caregivers (e.g., crying, clinging). Once they have achieved proximity and safety, their attachment system is deactivated.

Thus, the primary caregiver’s responsiveness and availability during infancy and early childhood play a crucial role in shaping a child’s attachment style.

The development of a dismissive-avoidant attachment style can often be traced back to childhood experiences where the caregiver failed to serve as a secure base. 

In a healthy parent-child relationship, the caregiver provides a safe haven for the child to explore from and return to for comfort, protection, and emotional support when needed.

However, for children who develop dismissive-avoidant attachment, their caregivers may have been unresponsive, rejecting, or inconsistent in meeting their emotional needs. 

When these children sought comfort or expressed distress, their caregivers might have discouraged, ignored, or even shamed these displays of vulnerability. As a result, the child learns that their caregiver is not a reliable source of safety and support.

To cope with this lack of a secure base, the child adapts by suppressing their own emotional needs and developing a premature sense of self-reliance. They learn to avoid seeking connection or expressing vulnerability, as they believe their needs will not be met or will be met with rejection. 

This defensive strategy of emotional suppression and independence carries into adulthood, shaping their dismissive-avoidant attachment style in relationships.

It’s important to note that attachment styles are not solely determined by early childhood experiences. Genetics, innate personality traits, and life experiences can also interact with the caregiving environment to create an attachment style.

Furthermore, attachment styles are not necessarily stable over time, and relationships later in life can also significantly impact shaping attachment styles.

For example, individuals who have healthy and high-quality friendships during their teenage years are more likely to be securely attached in adulthood.

It is possible to live a happy and meaningful life despite having an insecure attachment style. However, your insecurities can prevent you from enjoying healthy and rewarding relationships.

The human brain can change and rewire throughout life (termed “neuroplasticity”), and we can, therefore, learn new ways of thinking and behaving – but it takes consistent work, practice, and patience.  

It’s like learning to ride a bicycle; it takes effort and concentration at first, but eventually, it becomes automatic.

Learning new ways of thinking, behaving, and relating is a process that requires self-awareness, self-compassion, and a willingness to challenge and change deep-rooted patterns of relating to others. This process can feel very difficult and uncomfortable.

But, by focusing on the desired benefits and practicing often and with purpose, you can develop a more secure attachment style. The following is some advice to get you started:

Because your expectations of other people and relationships formed in your younger years, your patterns of thought, feeling, and behavior are mostly automatic and subconscious.

That means you may not be aware of why you think, feel, and behave in certain ways. Therefore, to create change, you must first become aware of your dismissive-avoidant attachment style and how it manifests in your relationships.

If you have established that you have an avoidant attachment style, pay close attention to situations that make you feel uncomfortable and provoke a need to shut down or run away.

What thoughts go through your mind? How does your body feel? What is your mind telling you to do?

When you are mindful of these situations and how you are feeling, it’s much easier to intervene. Ask yourself: Am I pushing someone away because I’m scared of getting close? Am I not asking for support because I fear they will reject me?

Take time and observe what is happening in your mind and body before reacting. It can be helpful to write these thoughts down in a journal to process your emotions, set goals, and track your progress.

It’s hard work transforming your attachment style so ensure you have compassion for yourself and do not give up even when you experience a drawback or obstacle.

Make time for self-care and activities that are good for you and that you enjoy. Get in touch with yourself and listen to your body and mind when it tells you to take a break or slow down. 

You could spend more time in nature, exercise a few times a week, meditate, or journal.

Having an insecure attachment style is a likely indication that you experienced difficulties in childhood and adolescence. Therefore, it can be helpful to engage with a therapist who can explore unhelpful beliefs, emotional triggers, and avoidant behaviors with you. 

Therapy provides a safe space to explore your attachment style, process past experiences, and develop healthier ways of relating to others. 

There are attachment-specific therapies such as schema therapy or attachment-based therapy, but any type of therapy or counseling can be helpful.

Attachment theory is a well-researched and evidence-based topic, so there is plenty of information out there that can help you better understand your attachment style. 

The key is to understand the theory in the context of your life and relationships so you can recognize patterns and apply the knowledge.

Understanding the origins of your attachment patterns can provide insights into why you developed a dismissive-avoidant style and can help you address underlying issues.

A securely attached role model can help you to learn how to feel more secure in relationships. It could be a friend, partner, or mentor — anyone who can help reinforce positive changes and offer emotional support when needed. Observe and learn from individuals with secure attachment styles. Notice how they handle emotional closeness, communicate, and navigate relationship challenges

It’s always helpful to ask yourself: How would someone with a secure attachment behave?

For example, a securely attached person communicates openly and does not avoid emotional conversations and conflict. 

They can see the world from another person’s perspective and reflect on their behavior and mental state. They trust other people, desire and give affection, and are relatively consistent in relationships. 

They see the value of close relationships and intimacy, are unafraid of commitment, and build and maintain long-lasting relationships.

People with an avoidant attachment style may seem confident and high in self-esteem but they tend to be hypersensitive to rejection and slights from others. 

This is actually a sign of low self-esteem and an underlying belief that they are not worthy of love. This typically stems from not having their needs met in childhood. Thus, their avoidance of intimacy is a defense mechanism they have developed to avoid further rejection.

An essential step in healing an avoidant attachment style is to let go of this fear of rejection and learn how to trust others. 

It means valuing and seeking close relationships and intimacy and understanding that being open with your emotions does not make you weak or needy.

Having a secure attachment style does not mean you have to let go of your independence; it just means you get to expand yourself to allow other people in. 

Allow yourself to be more open and vulnerable in your relationships. This doesn’t mean you have to share everything all at once, but gradually opening up about your feelings and needs can foster a deeper emotional connection with others.

It is important to find a way to sit with your emotions and to allow yourself to feel them, rather than avoid them.

When an avoidant individual feels pressure to be emotionally intimate or like too much is expected of them, they respond in an automatic way: withdraw and shut down.

Grounding techniques can help you manage those difficult emotions that come up when you feel overwhelmed and allow you to learn new ways of responding. Mindfulness, breathing exercises, and journalling are helpful grounding techniques that you can try.

Practicing grounding techniques regularly and as often as possible will develop your ability to regulate your emotions over time. 

They can also be useful in the moment when you are feeling overwhelmed or trapped or when you are testing out secure behaviors.

The best way to change maladaptive beliefs is to have evidence that contradicts these beliefs. This is where behavioral experiments are useful.

For example, when your partner or friend wants you to be more open with them, you could stay and communicate your feelings instead of withdrawing and running away.

These experiments can help you to realize that allowing other people in and being vulnerable does not necessarily lead to rejection. In this way, you can learn new behaviors and ways of thinking. 

Free yourself from the past by taking control of your feelings and behaviors. What other people do is beyond your control, but you can learn to control your own thoughts and responses. 

Of course, this takes time and practice, but it’s an empowering process that will eventually allow you to trust others and value intimacy more.

Make your healing journey your responsibility, keeping your goal of being more securely attached at the forefront of your mind.

Here are some tips for dating someone with a dismissive-avoidant attachment style:

Remember, a loving relationship is possible with care, patience, and mutual commitment to understanding each other’s needs and supporting each other’s growth. But don’t ignore your own needs – a partnership should enrich both of your lives.

Yes, dismissive-avoidants can fall in love, but they may struggle with the vulnerability and intimacy that comes with it. 

They might feel overwhelmed by their emotions and push their partner away to maintain a sense of independence and emotional distance. 

However, with self-awareness, communication, and a willingness to work on their attachment style, dismissive-avoidants can learn to navigate their feelings and build healthier, more secure relationships. 

Dismissive-avoidants may show love through practical support, such as helping with tasks or offering advice. They might also express love by giving their partner space and respecting their independence. 

Physical affection and verbal expressions of love may be less common, as dismissive-avoidants tend to feel uncomfortable with emotional intimacy. 

Dismissive-avoidants often prefer practical demonstrations of love, such as acts of service and gifts, as these allow them to maintain emotional distance while still expressing and receiving affection in a tangible, less emotionally vulnerable way.

To create a safe space, it’s better to ask each other questions rather than insist on discussing emotions directly, as this reduces the pressure of vulnerability.

However, they can learn to show love in more emotionally connected ways through self-awareness, communication, and effort to understand their partner’s needs.

While dismissive avoidants may appear to handle breakups well on the surface, they experience a range of emotions internally. 

However, their unique way of processing emotions and their tendency to compartmentalize or suppress feelings makes it challenging to define clear breakup stages or a timeline for their emotional journey post-breakup.

Rather than experiencing distinct breakup stages, dismissive avoidants tend to have multidimensional emotional and mental states after a breakup. 

They can feel mixed emotions simultaneously, such as sadness, hurt, relief, regret, and anger. However, they control what they allow their mind to dwell on and can compartmentalize or suppress their feelings if they become uncomfortable.

Dismissive avoidants experience these emotions in unique ways, and the intensity and duration may vary. They may not show their emotions outwardly, as they have trained themselves to avoid appearing vulnerable or lacking control.

It is difficult to establish a clear breakup timeline for dismissive avoidants, as they process emotions differently and may not even remember details of the breakup. 

Expecting them to eventually process the breakup in a typical manner may be unrealistic given their attachment style.

While dismissive-avoidant attachment style and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) may appear similar due to shared traits like emotional distance and perceived confidence, there are key differences in how they manifest.

Narcissists thrive on praise and admiration, whereas those with dismissive-avoidant attachment may feel uncomfortable with praise, perceiving it as an attempt at emotional closeness. 

Dismissive-avoidants are more likely to be empathetic, valuing others’ feelings and trying to avoid hurting them, even if they don’t desire connection themselves. They may also seek help to understand their behavior.

In contrast, narcissists rarely take responsibility for their actions, often blaming others, and are unlikely to seek change. 

Dismissive-avoidant attachment is sometimes compared to avoidant personality disorder, but the latter involves a more general fear of socialization. Dismissive-avoidants typically don’t have issues with social interaction itself, but rather with the emotional aspects of relationships.

These distinctions highlight the importance of understanding the nuances between these conditions, as they require different approaches in terms of support and treatment.

Emotional vulnerability can be hard, and cultivating meaningful relationships isn’t always easy either. However, for some people, close attachments to others are so scary that they’d rather just avoid them altogether.

Do you or someone you love have difficulty talking about emotions and forming connections with others? Do you or they get uncomfortable in close relationships, perhaps to the point of acting self-destructively? These symptoms point to having a dismissive-avoidant attachment style. 

Dismissive-avoidant attachment is a pattern that starts in early childhood, so its development isn’t something one has control over. People with dismissive-avoidant attachment might not always know why they struggle in relationships and pull away from intimacy. However, there are ways to overcome it.

Dismissive-avoidant attachment is a kind of attachment style characterized by someone avoiding vulnerability, closeness, and intimate attachment to others. A dismissive-avoidant person may avoid relationships and crave independence. 

Attachment styles are based on the care you received or bonds you created as a small child. They affect how you act in relationships with others, whether it be family, friends, or significant others. Not all of them are considered unhealthy, but some can certainly cause damage to your relationships and hinder your ability to get your needs met.

Dismissive-avoidant is one of four types of attachment styles:

Attachment styles are influenced by the bond or connection you formed with a primary caregiver when you were a baby. Depending on what type of bonds you experienced as an infant, your response to attachment or closeness with those around you may differ.

If your caregiver was able to successfully interpret your nonverbal emotional cues (or keep trying until they did), then they likely made you feel heard and safe, causing you to form a secure attachment style. 

However, inconsistent or startling responses to those needs often lead to insecure attachment styles, such as dismissive-avoidant, ambivalent, or disorganized attachment.

Dismissive-avoidant attachment specifically can be caused by many different kinds of separation or withdrawal from your primary caregiver. They may have been depressed, or perhaps had health issues when you were a baby, causing them to be less present and unable to consistently meet your care needs. You also may have experienced neglect or abuse, either physically or emotionally. Even numerous moves from environment to environment can cause dismissive-avoidant attachment.

In short, you learn as a child that support and care were not consistent when they came from others. Because of this, you decided you could only depend on yourself for those things, and that relying on others was not safe, which is what causes you to be so wary of connection as an adult.

The most prominent characteristic of dismissive-avoidant attachment is extreme self-sufficiency. People with a dismissive-avoidant attachment style do not want to rely on anyone, and in turn, do not want anyone relying on them. They value their freedom highly, believing that they function at their best by themselves. They have no need for support or reassurance, so they may seem very confident.

However, this need for independence comes from deep-seated inner fragility. Dismissive avoidants are fearful of rejection, so they believe that it’s easier to protect themselves from hurt if no one can get close enough to reject them. 

Dismissive-avoidants also tend to put on a front of superiority to hide these vulnerabilities, acting like they are better than everyone else and frequently criticizing others. This can be more subtle as well, like high amounts of confidence or comfort with who they are, or putting a large amount of value in their professional success.

They will often withdraw as soon as they feel needed or too close to someone, claiming that they feel “trapped” or “controlled.” This can lead to them ignoring attempts to contact them, keeping secrets, or making plans without their partner in order to put distance between them.

Despite how they act in relationships, though, dismissive-avoidants can be fun friends to have. They tend to be social and outgoing, and can also have large friend groups, depending on the person. These friend groups are likely full of acquaintances or casual friends—impermanent people with little personal attachment to them.

These two conditions are two separate diagnoses, and though their traits may seem similar, there are some fundamental differences in how they operate.

First, while both may cause people to come off as confident, narcissists love to receive praise. Those with a dismissive-avoidant attachment style, though, might feel uncomfortable with praise, since they might perceive it as an attempt to bond or express closeness.

People with dismissive-avoidant attachment are also more likely to be empathetic. Though dismissive-avoidants don’t desire connection, they still value the feelings of others and might find ways not to hurt them. They might go so far as to seek help and figure out why they act the way they do. However, narcissists will rarely take ownership of their abusive behavior or mistakes, often blaming the issues on someone else, and likely won’t seek to change in any way.

The dismissive-avoidant attachment style is also often compared to avoidant personality disorder, though they are also quite different. Those with avoidant personality disorder are more afraid of socialization in general, whereas most people with dismissive-avoidant attachment have no problem with interacting with others—it’s the emotional side they have issues with.

Despite their aversion to intimacy, dismissive-avoidant people can still find themselves in relationships. However, there are many patterns that can cause disruption within the relationship if they are not changed or dealt with.

As people get closer to them, whether they’re in a relationship with them or are simply becoming closer friends, they can start to seem more emotionally distant. Their discomfort with emotional intimacy becomes more clear, and they may start looking for a way out.

Their inability to open up can leave their partner feeling alone and ignored. However, if this subject is broached, it can cause the dismissive-avoidant person to feel trapped and called-out, leading them to find reasons to end things. They might start acting rude or trying to find flaws in their partner so that they have an excuse to break up with them.

Dismissive-avoidants believe that they don’t need emotional connection and use this behavior as a defense mechanism. However, the isolation that it causes can affect their overall happiness in the long term.

They are certainly capable of feeling and falling in love. However, depending on how deep their avoidance of their emotions goes, they may not admit it to anyone, including themselves. They might also try to ignore it and abandon it instead of recognizing and acting on it.

They mostly don’t, since it might signal to their partner that they desire a closer bond, but they might in indirect ways. It can be tough to recognize, since there’s a constant barrier guarding their emotions and keeping things from getting too deep.

They likely won’t show their love through words or touch, but they might start to spend more time around you. Even if they feel themselves getting closer to someone, though, they will still have a hard time hearing about any negative emotions.

Any situation that makes you feel out of control can feel extremely triggering if you have dismissive-avoidant attachment. Conflict is often very uncomfortable, especially if you feel criticized or if the circumstance feels emotionally volatile.

If you feel like someone has become dependent on you, you might start feeling controlled, which is a big trigger for dismissive avoidants. Their expectations for your relationship, especially vulnerability, can make you feel very uncomfortable and start to look for ways to distance yourself. 

Insistence on talking about your emotions can put too much pressure on dismissive-avoidants. Instead of this, it can be best to spend time simply asking each other questions. This way, the expectation of vulnerability isn’t so prominent, which helps to create a safe space.

Emotional intimacy is an integral part of forging close relationships, so avoiding it can present serious challenges. At first, it can seem like staying away from emotionality is protective, since no conflict or difficult emotions have to be dealt with. However, every human needs connection with other people in some form or another, so continuing on a dismissive-avoidant path can cause toxicity for all parties in the relationship.

That being said, this attachment style won’t necessarily be toxic, especially in relationships that don’t require a lot of openness or intense emotion, like a casual friendship.

Though these behaviors often seem like a conscious choice, the reasoning behind them is initially rooted in the subconscious. People with a dismissive-avoidant attachment style may not know that the reason they push people away stems from their early childhood experiences. This is why identifying your attachment style can be so helpful and important for emotional growth.

If you believe that you might have a dismissive-avoidant or another insecure attachment style, consider talking to a mental health professional. They can help you dissect your behaviors and patterns, work with you to identify your insecurities, and give you tools to help you develop a more secure attachment style. 

However, if you don’t have access to adequate mental health services, there are other ways for you to develop a more secure attachment style. Working on aspects of yourself like improving your communication skills and making friends with people who already have secure attachment styles will open the door for closer connections and help show you what healthy and secure relationships look like. Increasing your emotional intelligence by expressing your emotions and needs and listening to those close to you when they do the same is another way to better your relationships with others.

Everyone deserves to experience the joy that meaningful connection and healthy, intimate relationships can bring. Learning to let down some of your defenses and committing to trying new modes of connection are excellent ways to move into a more secure attachment style.

The 5 conditions for secure attachment


 


Published on July 2, 2020
Updated on April 14, 2024 

The avoidant attachment style (referred to as anxious-avoidant in childhood) is one of the three insecure adult attachment styles identified in psychological literature.

Caregivers (usually parents) who are strict and emotionally distant, do not tolerate expressions of feelings, and expect their child to be independent and tough might raise children with an avoidant attachment style.

Avoidant attachment in adults may, from the outside, look like self-confidence and self-sufficiency. This is because the avoidant attachment style causes a low tolerance for emotional or physical intimacy and, sometimes, struggles with building long-lasting relationships. Furthermore, in the workplace, adults with avoidant attachment are often seen as the independent, “lone wolf” type. However, due to their self-sufficiency, they may also be high achievers.

It is, however, possible to heal from the avoidant attachment style. With increased understanding, the correct strategies, and therapy when needed, adults with the avoidant attachment style can form healthier outlooks and behaviors, and develop a more secure attachment style.

In this article, we will cover the most common questions around avoidant attachment:

Have you ever wondered why some people do not want to depend on or truly connect with anyone, even when in a relationship? Most of us aim to build strong relationships throughout our lives.

We are ‘hungry’ for love and affection. Why? Because emotional intimacy has many advantages. Namely, we are able to share our thoughts and feelings openly, we receive support and reassurance, we feel heard, appreciated, valued, and consequently, we feel calm and safe.

Emotional closeness can provide us with a feeling of stability – we are not going through life alone; we have someone to rely on. If we feel safe and valued by others, we are also able to maintain a higher self-esteem and a positive outlook on life.

If you are someone that needs to have close relationships and wants to rely on others (and have others rely on you), you have probably wondered why some people lack these basic human desires. How do they even make it work?

The truth is, this is most often not a conscious choice. The way we form relationships as adults has a lot to do with the way we formed our first social bonds as children with our caregivers.

Attachment theory is well-known and researched in the field of Psychology. Psychiatrist and psychoanalyst John Bowlby and his attachment theory shed light on and explain this phenomenon.

Attachment theory suggests that our early relationships with our caregivers (in childhood) set the stage for how we build relationships in the future (in adulthood).

The behavior of our caregivers is the first example of social interactions that we are presented with. It thus becomes informative of how relationships work.

Are other people going to take care of me? Can I trust them? Can I rely on them?

When raising a baby in a secure environment, where the caregivers are emotionally available and responsive to the baby’s needs, the answers to these (subconscious) questions will probably be yes. This is what we call a secure attachment.

However, when the child perceives that their basic and emotional needs are not met, they will have a hard time trusting people. Social bonds might be perceived by such children as not safe or stable. This is how a child forms an insecure attachment.

Let’s get back to that person you know, who is self-sufficient and does not (want to) rely on others. Based on attachment theory, we would categorize his or her attachment style as an insecure attachment style. It is known, more specifically, as avoidant/dismissive.

The development of an anxious-avoidant attachment style in a child has much to do with the emotional availability of their caregivers. The caregivers do not necessarily neglect the child in general; they are present.

Nevertheless, they tend to avoid the display of emotion and intimacy and are often misattuned to the child’s emotional needs. Such caregivers are reserved and seem to back off when the child reaches out for support, reassurance and affection.

The caregivers are likely to become more distant as the situation gets more emotionally dense. They might become overwhelmed and want to get out. This is when their unavailability would be most evident.

The child expresses a need for closeness, but instead of receiving it, they perceive that the door is shut in their face. Parents whose children become avoidant might not only avoid expressing their own feelings.

They might also disapprove of and not tolerate any notable display of emotions from their children, regardless of whether it is negative (sadness / fear) or positive (excitement / joy).

When such display of emotions occurs, caregivers can become angry and try to disrupt the child’s behavior by telling the child to toughen up. The parent expects the young child to behave independent, serious, and reserved.

Being raised in such an environment is likely to cause an avoidant attachment style. Most often, the caregivers have this attachment style themselves. Since the parent was raised that way, they pass it on, unintentionally, to the next generation.

Adults with the dismissive / avoidant attachment style seem to be pretty happy about who they are and where they are.

They might be very social, easy-going, and fun to be around. In addition, these individuals might have a lot of friends and/or sexual partners. Generally speaking, they are not alone or lonely.

Avoidant adults tend to be independent. Their self-esteem is high and they do not rely on others for reassurance or emotional support.

Such individuals might invest in their professional development and are likely to build up their confidence on each personal success. They seem to be in control.

For avoidant adults, social interactions and bonds remain on the surface. In order for a relationship to be meaningful and fulfilling, it has to become deep. That’s when you would ‘hit a wall’ when dealing with avoidant attachment style and relationships.

These individuals will let you be around them, but will not let you in. They tend to avoid strong displays of closeness and intimacy. As soon as things get serious, dismissive/avoidant individuals are likely to close themselves off.

At this point, such people might try to find a reason to end a relationship. They might be highly annoyed by their partner’s behavior, habit, or even physical appearance. Consequently, they start drifting off and distancing themselves from the partner. Adults with this attachment style believe that they do not need emotional intimacy in their lives.

This is a direct result of their upbringing. Their caregivers showed them that people cannot be relied on. Whenever they sought emotional support in the past, it was not provided. They simply stop seeking or expecting it from others. It’s as if they have ‘turned off the switch’.

From the outside, an adult with an avoidant attachment style might look confident, strong, and together. This does not mean, however, that this person is not suffering or making those around him/her suffer.

To the avoidant adult, emotional closeness and intimacy are often off the table. Not because they will not reap benefits, but because they do not know how.

Either way, not being able to build a deep, meaningful, and long-lasting relationship can be painful for people with this attachment style. It can also be heart-breaking for the ones who love them.

Furthermore, having an avoidant attachment style as a parent is likely to affect your child’s attachment style. If you have it, you will probably pass it on.

If you recognize the dismissive/avoidant attachment style in yourself or you realize you are dating someone with avoidant attachment style, what can you do?

The key is to admit and realize that the ‘switch’ on emotional intimacy has to be turned on. This might be challenging and require a lot of effort.

What do I feel? The avoidant adult needs to start paying attention to the emotional and physical sensations that come up around (emotional) intimacy. Self-reflection might help one make sense of and analyze existing patterns.

What do I need? Another essential step is exploring, understanding, and eventually expressing emotional needs.

What should I do? At some point, the avoidant adult might be able to start working on building closer relationships with people. They could follow a step-by-step approach to letting others in and responding to the emotional needs of close ones.

Obviously, working with a therapist on this pattern would potentially be the most beneficial way to move forward with earning secure attachment. If that’s not an option for you, we have online courses for you to move forward.

Either way, if you want to change your attachment style, you need to put effort in it. Whether you are working through it with a close friend, a therapist, or a book, consistency and effort are fundamental.

If you prefer to go the route of a workbook, we recently released our first series of attachment style digital workbooks.

If you feel distant and disconnected in your relationships and often withdraw from contact, this workbook might just be the step you need to take to begin your journey to positive change.

Our avoidant attachment style digital workbook includes:

We are frequently asked some recurring questions about the avoidant attachment style. We’re going to go through some of these to better help you understand the phenomenon of avoidant attachment. 

The answer to this question isn’t necessarily simple: We’re all unique with individual needs. Having said as much, the roots of an avoidant attachment style are in a childhood of perceived rejection. Therefore, if you or someone you love has an avoidant attachment, then you may have shut your attachment system down. This means that you may withdraw from emotional closeness and intimacy because you’ve convinced yourself that you don’t need it. However, we all need love–and the only way to heal is to open yourself up to opportunities for it.

The best way of healing is to process your issues around relationships with a mental health professional. Yet, if this isn’t an option for you, there are other ways of becoming more self-aware and open. For example, dedicated workbooks and strategies that target avoidant attachment in a phased, gentle manner can be of great assistance.

The answer to this question is, yes. Of course, it is possible to date with an avoidant attachment style. However, how to date with an avoidant attachment style may look quite different to those with a secure, anxious, or disorganized style. 

You may need to recognize your boundaries and how you enact them–after all, even though you may be uncomfortable with emotions, the likelihood is that the person you’re dating will require you to open up from time to time. 

Again, self-work can make dating with an avoidant attachment style an easier process, and this is best done with a therapist. Yet, you can still make big strides through more self-directed strategies such as workbooks and courses dedicated to the avoidant attachment style.

The question of whether men with an avoidant attachment style feel love is a common one, yet it also perpetuates a myth about people with an avoidant attachment style in general. For one thing, both men and women develop the avoidant attachment style, even though it is predominantly associated with men.

Another point is that, of course, avoidant attachment men feel love. The difference is that they struggle to both show and accept it. Remember, their early attempts for affection were likely rejected, so they internalized the message that people will reject their attempts and brought this message into their adult lives.

If you’re wondering how to deal with avoidant attachment in relationships, the answer will depend on whether you’re the one with the avoidant attachment style, or if you’re dating someone with it. 

If you’re the one with avoidant attachment, make sure you check out our guide Avoidant Attachment in Relationships for assistance. And remember, if it’s an issue you can’t solve by yourself, a trained couples therapist may be able to help.

The avoidant attachment style is one of the three insecure attachment styles. Avoidant attachment is characterized by withdrawal from emotional closeness, denial of emotions, independence, and self-sufficiency. 

It’s important to understand that although adults with the avoidant attachment style may act as though they don’t need love, the opposite is true–they need love just as much as everyone else. However, their early years didn’t equip them with the ability to show and receive affection and emotional closeness. 

It’s clear that the avoidant attachment style can be difficult both for those with it and for the people who love someone with avoidant attachment. Yet, attachment styles are not a life sentence: If you have an avoidant attachment style, it is always possible to heal and grow. Tuning into your emotions, the needs of others, and further understanding your attachment style is an excellent place to start.

Remember, if you want to achieve a more secure attachment style, therapy with a trained mental health professional is the best situation in which to do so. In a relationship with a therapist, someone with an avoidant attachment can learn how to trust in others, become more aware of their own emotions, and open up more in relationships.

Having a dismissive avoidant attachment style won’t enable you to fly, see the future or give you super-strength. Yet, you might be surprised to hear that the unique traits of this attachment style can be used so effectively that they could be considered your personal superpowers.

It is important to be aware of the traits of your attachment style and how they can negatively impact your life and relationships. However, it’s also advantageous to focus on how avoidant attachment can benefit you.

In this article, we will discuss:

Humans learn to connect to one another – both personally and professionally – through how we connected in our formative years with our caregivers. If a child feels safe, seen, and known by their caregivers, then they will likely develop a secure attachment. As they grow up, these children typically have a positive view of themselves and others and can healthily regulate their emotions. 

However, if a child develops in an environment that they perceive as inconsistent, neglectful, or traumatic, then they may end up developing an insecure attachment. There are three forms of insecure attachment: anxious, avoidant, and disorganized. 

A dismissive avoidant attachment style (also known as avoidant) is one of the three insecure attachment styles. It typically stems from perceived rejection from caregivers during the first eighteen months of life. These caregivers may have acted emotionally unavailable to their children and avoided emotion and intimacy. 

It’s not necessarily that they purposely rejected their child’s wants or needs, but probably that they didn’t understand them. Therefore, when their child searched for support, affection, and connection, these caregivers may have closed down emotionally and retreated from them. As a result, these children tend to form the belief that people in their lives won’t meet their needs. As a result, they can’t rely on others.

Consequently, someone with this form of attachment often avoids emotional closeness with others – this is a defense mechanism for their belief that others will let them down or abandon them. They’re simply getting in there first and preventing the pain of rejection! 

However, by refusing to allow yourself to let others into your life, you may in fact be creating the exact situation that you are trying to avoid. That is, becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy whereby you are pushing people away and reinforcing the belief that you are unloveable.

It’s understandable to presume that there are only undesirable consequences to having a dismissive avoidant attachment style. Yet, it may surprise you to learn that there are potentially a number of benefits. 

According to research, between 33-50% of people are insecurely attached. This is a strikingly high percentage and presents a “paradox” between how the majority of people function on a successful level despite having insecure attachment. Therefore, there clearly must be some positive attributes to having an insecure attachment. 

Positive psychology is the study of the factors that make life most worth living. Implementing its strategies can help you to build on your personal strengths, increase your sense of self, and improve the quality of your relationships. However, before you can build upon your strengths, you may first need a little support in recognizing the advantages of dismissive avoidant attachment.

Avoidantly workers could be considered evolutionary altruists. They are incurring a personal cost in order to enhance the quality of life of others. The results of a study by Ein-Dor and colleagues (2010) demonstrated that although having an insecure attachment style can be harmful on an individual level, there is a potential evolutionary benefit. 

They explained this paradox by suggesting that although there are undoubtedly personal drawbacks to having an insecure attachment, there are also valuable group benefits. Therefore, the occurrence of insecure attachments styles may not be accidental and instead the result of evolutionary selective force. 

Someone with an avoidant attachment style has the ability to increase the productivity of their team and save on resources. Avoidant attachment is associated with quicker responses to threat, which is beneficial in the workplace as they can rapidly identify problems and leave enough time to solve issues or reduce their impact. 

Avoidant attachers are less likely to require the support of others in the workplace when making decisions. They are highly independent and are more likely to have confidence in their professional choices and abilities. Therefore, they often increase efficiency and reduce the demand for resources at work. 

When a deadline is near, an avoidant employee is the most likely to get the job done! Because they are likely less interested in socializing at work, colleagues with avoidant attachment are more likely to focus their energy on their work and performance. 

Someone with an avoidant attachment style is more likely to push themselves towards success and greatness in the workplace. Seeing as they are less likely to spend time on their personal relationships, they are keen to commit themselves to their job and career growth. Therefore, avoidant attachers can scale to the top of the professional ladder.

Avoidant attachers in relationships are less needy and clingy with their partner; thus, they will be less demanding and suffocating within a relationship than other attachment styles. Of course, the attachment style of their partner will determine how they respond to this amount of space. 

Still, someone with an avoidant attachment style is likely to be respectful of their partner’s boundaries. This means that they won’t infringe on their other half’s parameters and thus threaten the relationship. They won’t probe for too much information or force them to share too much personal information, and they will respect the other person’s freedom.

Furthermore, due to an avoidant attachers’ early experiences, they are more likely to protect their emotions. This means that they can be reserved in relationships. They are also less likely to expose themselves emotionally and be vulnerable.

As we’re aware, people with an avoidant attachment are highly independent and self-reliant. However, this doesn’t mean that they can’t be great friends. 

Someone with dismissive avoidant attachment can be very sociable and popular. You might notice that they are confident in themselves and what they have to offer others within their friend group. For this reason, and the fact that they find emotional closeness difficult, avoidant adults may be more likely to have a lot of friends rather than a few close ones.

Avoidant attachers are often the life and soul of the party due to their elevated confidence and high self-esteem. They may also express interest in the new people in their friend group, even if they don’t wish to deepen the connection. Someone with an avoidant attachment also won’t pester their friends to share their emotions or to spend time with them. They will allow them their personal space.

People with avoidant attachment can be great for practical advice. However, they may not tell their friends what they want to hear. Instead, they tell them what they need to hear. Avoidant adults tend to lead with logic rather than their emotions. 

Which of the avoidant attachment superpowers do you identify with the most? Attachment styles are often a spectrum. The amount that you identify with the traits of your attachment style will likely differ from someone else.

THE COMPLETE GUIDE

An anxious attachment style in relationships can be challenging to manage. Whereas anxious attachers are sensitive and attuned to their partners’ needs, they also typically require constant reassurance and affection to feel safe as part of a romantic couple. If validation isn’t provided in the way an anxious attacher requires, they may feel worried and stressed about their relationships.

People with the anxious attachment style often internalize what they perceive to be a lack of affection and intimacy as not being “worthy of love,” and they intensely fear rejection as a result. In an attempt to avoid abandonment, an anxious attacher may become clingy, hypervigilant, and jealous in a relationship. They are often overwhelmed by the fear of being alone, so they do whatever they can within their power to hold on to their relationship. Someone with an anxious attachment style sees their partner as the remedy to their strong emotional needs.

For these reasons, the following will discuss:




Attachment Theory posits that the bond that a child forms with their caregiver(s) in their early years of life (approximately the first eighteen months) influences how they will later approach social interactions and relationships.
A child develops a secure attachment style in response to caregivers that are attuned and responsive to their needs. These children understand that their caregivers can be relied upon and they develop a strong emotional connection with them and a sense of safety within their world. In turn, they are indirectly taught that their needs are important and that people, in general, can be trusted.
However, if a child interprets their caregivers’ responses to their needs as inconsistent, they may develop an anxious attachment style. The caregivers of an anxious child may act supportive and attentive to their child’s needs on occasion, but other times are misattuned and don’t connect with what their child wants. The child ultimately ends up confused regarding their relationship with their caregivers – these mixed signals make it very difficult for them to make sense of caregivers’ actions.

The child ultimately ends up confused regarding their relationship with their caregivers – these mixed signals make it very difficult for them to make sense of caregivers’ actions.

Anxiously attached children end up highly confused regarding their caregivers’ inconsistent actions – they don’t understand why they change their behaviors from one extreme to the other. Consequently, these conflicting actions result in the child struggling to trust their caregivers. As a result of this inconsistency, the child may exhibit: separation anxiety, poor emotional regulation, become highly emotionally reactive and seek constant proximity with their caregiver.The child grows up believing that their needs are only important to others when it’s convenient.Thus, as adults, they may find themselves in relationships that mirror their childhood dynamics – where love and affection are only given conditionally – as these behaviors were normalized at a young age.


Even though romantic connections are something that someone with an anxious attachment style typically craves, they may still find relationships stressful and anxiety-inducing.
Anxious attachers are highly attuned to their partners’ needs and are usually happy to cater to them. However, due to their insecurities and doubts about their self-worth, they often project their uncertainty about themselves onto their partners’ behaviors. If the anxious attacher’s partner fails to respond to their needs in the way they require them to, then the anxious attacher perceives this as confirmation of the fact that they are not worthy of love.
In many ways, relationships are both the poison and the cure for someone with an anxious attachment style. From the poison perspective, the anxious attacher partner deeply fears being rejected or abandoned. This fear leads them to act hypervigilant towards any potential threat to the relationship and constantly require validation and confirmation that their partner loves them. On the other hand, being in the company of their loved one makes someone with an anxious attachment style feel comforted and soothed – the cure.

If you’re wondering whether you (or your partner) have an anxious attachment style, the signs of anxious attachment in relationships include:


Being attuned and sensitive to your partner’s needs
Prioritizing the needs of a partner over your own
Seeking validation and assurance that you are loved, worthy, and “good enough”
Hypervigilance towards any threats to the relationship
Fear of rejection and abandonment
Jealousy and suspicion of your partner’s actions
Clinginess and poor sense of boundaries
Difficulty expressing or understanding your intense emotions
Excessive anxiety or worry


Inevitably, anxious attachment relationship issues can be destructive to one’s love life. The traits of this attachment style can even trigger avoidant strategies in a partner and cause them to withdraw from a relationship.

Deep down, someone with an anxious attachment style believes that as soon as their partners get to know the “real them,” they’ll lose interest and reject them. Ultimately, the anxious attacher’s low self-esteem causes them to think that they’re not good enough to retain a partner’s interest in the long run.

Remember – the reason why someone with an anxious attachment style thinks and acts the way they do is rooted in their childhood. The way their desire for affection and intimacy was met in their formative years taught them that both themselves and their needs were unimportant. Therefore, they expect this pattern to continue in their romantic relationships – so they do everything in their power to prevent it.

Because the patterns of attachment anxiety are so ingrained, it can be challenging to know how to manage the anxious attachment style in relationships. However, with understanding and consistent effort, it is possible to move past the deep-rooted fears and insecurities of this attachment style and feel more fulfilled and secure within romantic partnerships.

Understanding the events or actions that trigger attachment insecurity can help an anxious attacher figure out how their thoughts and actions are affected and aid them when putting strategies in place to prevent their typical negative responses.


Typical anxious attachment relationship triggers include situations where a partner:


Acts distant or aloof
Forgets important events such as an anniversary
Acts too friendly/flirty with someone else
Comes home late or fails to respond to messages/calls
Fails to compliment something different, such as new clothes, or hairstyle
Cancels a date or meet-up


People with an anxious attachment style don’t act clingy or needy towards their partners all the time.
However, any of the above triggers could potentially cause the anxious attacher to feel overwhelmed by worry or fear of rejection. As a result, their attachment system may be triggered, and they may respond to the potential threat to their relationship by trying to reestablish as much closeness with their partner as possible, worrying excessively, and feeling depleted. These behaviors can cause a significant strain on a relationship and potentially even a break-up.

However, once someone with this attachment style starts to recognize their triggers and how they react to them, they can regulate their responses in healthier ways.

The following steps may help you overcome your anxious attachment style in romantic relationships:

Knowledge of how the different attachment styles are developed, triggered, and can affect thoughts and actions can help someone with an anxious attachment style better understand their own patterns of behavior, as well as those of their partner. Doing so can help reduce unpredictability in the relationship, as well as figure out the best strategies for coping with the anxious attachment style

Choosing a partner with a secure attachment style may be easier said than done – especially if you are already in a relationship.

That being said, a partner with a secure attachment style can help an anxious attacher to regulate their emotions more effectively and help them feel more secure in the relationship and in general. There are a number of tell-tale traits of the secure attachment style when dating someone new.

Someone with an anxious attachment style may attempt to manage their negative emotions through bursts of anger or jealousy towards their partner or by trying to reestablish closeness by clinging to them.

Effective communication involves taking a breather between an emotion and an action and expressing why you’re feeling frustration or worry. Creating internal scripts such as: 

“I understand that you may not understand why I’m upset, but here’s why I feel anxious_________,” or

 “I know that you didn’t intentionally mean to ignore my call, but it made me feel really worried.” 

…May help your partner understand your anxious attachment perspective without pushing them away. 

Moreover, you should also attempt to communicate your needs to your partner, as you may be used to prioritizing the needs of others over your own.

Anxious attachers often struggle to identify their emotions. Keeping a thought diary or journal may help you unpick your feelings and can help you recognize specific patterns in your thoughts and actions. Also, body mapping or body scan meditation may help you determine where you hold your emotions in your body.

Not everyone will be able to manage the traits of their anxious attachment style by themselves. After all, their patterns of thinking and acting were ingrained before they were able to verbalize their feelings.

Effective therapy can help you resolve issues from your early childhood and current relationships, as well as form a new blueprint for how healthy relationships should function.


Someone with an anxious attachment style has an intense fear of rejection and abandonment. Because an anxious attacher feels unworthy of love, they may focus on what they perceive to be a threat to their relationship in an attempt to prevent what they see as the inevitable from occurring – their partner leaving them.
Anxious attachers may even engage in protest behaviors such as bursts of anger towards their partner, or they may internalize their negative feelings and become self-critical, further reducing their levels of self-esteem.
Understandably, the traits of the anxious attachment style can make it difficult to know how to deal with an anxious attachment partner in a way that helps them to feel loved and secure.

Understandably, the traits of the anxious attachment style can make it difficult to know how to deal with an anxious attachment partner in a way that helps them to feel loved and secure.

The following tips may help satisfy both your and your anxiously attached partner’s requirements within a romantic relationship:

Have an open and clear discussion with your partner about how you can help them feel secure in the relationship while still maintaining appropriate boundaries. Once you have done so, aim to reinforce these boundaries consistently.

If your anxious partner struggles to manage their intense emotions by themselves, you could encourage them to seek professional help. A skilled therapist can help them process their childhood experiences and equip them with the tools to manage their thoughts and feelings, as well as to communicate their needs in the relationship.

You could even try couples therapy to work together to resolve any attachment-related problems within the relationship.

Inconsistent behavior is a major trigger for someone with an anxious attachment style and could possibly activate anxious attachment jealousy. Regularly letting your anxiously attached partner know how important they are to you, and that you’re there for them, may help them feel more secure and supported within the relationship.

Allowing your partner to voice their anxieties can help them understand the flaws in their way of thinking. Validate their emotions, but also challenge the narrative that led them to feel anxious and insecure. Gently point out inaccuracies in their thought patterns, or else provide them with evidence to the contrary – such as how you’ve always been there consistently for them, so there’s no reason to think otherwise.


It may often feel like attachment styles are permanent. Yet, with knowledge, understanding, and the right skill-set, forming healthy relationships with an anxious attachment style is entirely possible.
Anxious attachers can develop “learned” secure attachment by identifying their irrational thoughts about themselves and relationships, and change their attachment-related behaviors as a result.
For some people, the best way of forging learned security is through a therapist. Others may feel more equipped to handle their issues with their partner, a trusted friend, or through a workbook. However, regardless of how they choose to do so, if someone with an anxious attachment style wants to achieve change, consistency and effort are key.

# Anxious Attachment Style: What It Looks Like in Adult Relationships

If you have an anxious attachment style, you may live with fear of abandonment and need constant reassurance from your loved ones. 

Anxious attachment is one of four types of attachment styles that have been associated with your primary bonds as a baby. These early relationships you established in childhood with your caregivers may impact how you relate to others in adulthood. 

In the world of psychology, this is known as attachment theory. This theory identifies these four attachment styles:

The last three attachment styles — anxious, avoidant, and disorganized — fall under the category of insecure attachment styles. 

But even if the way you relate to others is currently greatly impacting your life, you can change attachment styles, including anxious ones. The first step may be to identify the signs.

A few signs that you may have an anxious attachment include: 

An anxious attachment style can manifest in many ways. 

For example: 

Everyone’s story is different. An anxious attachment style is likely the result of a combination of factors and, in some cases, attachment trauma.

Some factors involved in developing an anxious attachment may include:

An anxious attachment style can emerge when a child’s interactions with their caregiver feel inconsistent, intrusive, or overwhelming, says Dr. Sarah Bren, a licensed clinical psychologist in Pelham, New York.

“When a caregiver themselves has an anxious attachment style, if they are unpredictable in how well they meet the child’s needs, or if the environment is chaotic or unpredictable, an anxious attachment can develop,” she says.

For example, perhaps your primary caregiver was inconsistent with their affection toward you. Sometimes they might have paid a lot of attention while other times they might have pushed you away. It’s also possible they felt overwhelmed when handling your care.

You might have developed a sense that your caregiver’s emotional state and mood were your responsibility and you had to make extraordinary efforts to “make them happy” or get love in return.

An anxious attachment style can impact the amount of joy you feel in your relationships, says Dr. Lori Lawrenz, a licensed clinical psychologist in Honolulu.

In fact, a 2019 meta-analysis of existing literature found that those who live with an anxious attachment style may have reduced relationship satisfaction, compared to those with secure attachments.

“Those with an anxious attachment style can sabotage their relationships with questions and concerns about small details, instead of being present and in the moment and enjoying their relationship,” explains Lawrenz.

Certain behaviors can also contribute to the very outcome that you fear: abandonment.

“When a lot of energy is spent thinking about if your partner is responding to you enough, or paying enough attention to you, it can be off-putting and turn your partner away,” adds Lawrenz.

As a result, you may experience:

Yes, it’s possible to change your attachment style from insecure to secure, says Bren.

“Therapy can help, as well as working to develop safe, trusting relationships with healthy and secure individuals. In psychology, we often refer to relationships like these as ‘corrective emotional experiences,’” says Bren.

A corrective emotional experience is when you update an old memory or belief system (such as feeling everyone abandons you) with something new: like being heard and understood by a person when you express your feelings.

With some intention and support, it’s possible to shift from an anxious to a secure attachment style.

In order to become more secure, you may find it helpful to focus on practicing vulnerability and building emotional safety to show yourself that it’s worth the risk, says Bren.

“For example, stepping out of your comfort zone and asking explicitly for what you want, or saying no when you don’t like something,” she explains. “Being clear with others about your needs, desires, and feelings, even when you fear it might disappoint or upset them.”

Relationships with secure people can help you learn that taking up space interpersonally is emotionally safe, she adds.

“Overanalyzing the relationship with a negative filter and thinking about the ‘what ifs’ instead of what is actually happening can hurt your relationship,” says Lawrenz.

A regular mindfulness practice may help you tune into the here and now and move through uncomfortable feelings in a positive way.

“Mindfulness is an important way for you to be present in the moment,” she says. “By learning mindfulness, you can engage with others, be more present, and develop relationship security.”

Some mindfulness-based activities may include: 

You may also want to explore what cognitive distortions you use and when. These negative filters on your thoughts may be preventing you from seeing the positive in your relationships.

You may find it empowering to learn more about your attachment style and how to move into a secure relationship.

You may also find it helpful to tune into the Personal Development School on Youtube, a popular channel all about attachment theory by Montreal-based therapist Thais Gibson.

If your attachment style is causing instability in your relationships, you may find it helpful to work with a therapist or couple’s counselor who specializes in attachment theory.

“Knowledge is power — if you know better you can do better,” says Lawrenz. “By engaging in therapy and learning to know and understand yourself, you can develop self-compassion and increased self-esteem, which are the building blocks of a secure attachment style.”

Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) is an effective approach for attachment style challenges.

An anxious attachment style may manifest in fear of abandonment and a need for validation and constant reassurance from your loved one. It’s typically caused by an unpredictable primary caregiver when you were a child.

Living with an anxious attachment style can pose challenges in your relationships, like difficulty being alone, people-pleasing behavior, or preoccupation with how others think and feel about you.

You’re not alone and there is hope. You may find it helpful to engage in mindfulness-based activities, practice setting boundaries, and work with a therapist in order to become more secure in your relationships.

Anxious attachment (also known as preoccupied attachment) is one of four attachment styles that people can develop. It is characterized by a fear of abandonment, a strong need for reassurance, and discomfort with too much independence in relationships.

If you tend to feel insecure, worried about rejection, or clingy with romantic partners, you may have an anxious attachment style.



Around 20% of people develop an anxious attachment (Hazan & Shaver, 2017), which originates in unpredictable or insensitive parenting in childhood.

The good news is that with self-awareness and effort, it is possible to feel more secure. Having an anxious attachment style doesn’t mean you can’t have healthy, thriving relationships.

While it presents challenges, you can absolutely learn to manage anxious attachment and heal emotional wounds with the right strategies.

Anxious attachment is thought to stem from childhood and can stick with a person into adulthood. 

While there is not always a clear-cut answer for why someone may develop an anxious attachment, it could be a result of some of the following factors:

If a parent or caregiver is distant or neglectful of the child’s needs, the child will not feel a sense of security and stability.

Children who do not get their emotional needs met, especially when distressed or anxious, are likely to experience elevated levels of these emotions.

For example, if, as a child, your parent never comforted you when you were upset and instead walked off or gave you the silent treatment, this could increase feelings of anxiety and of not feeling safe with your parent. 

This can continue throughout life in terms of friendships and romantic relationships in which others do not provide the comfort that the individual expects.

Parenting is inconsistent when there are times of support and responsiveness to the child’s needs, but at other times, they are cold, insensitive, or emotionally unavailable. 

For example, one time when you were angry as a child, your parent reassured you and talked you through your difficult feelings, but the next time it happened, they dismissed you and told you to ‘get over it.’

The child may become confused about their relationship with a caregiver, sending mixed signals.

This inconsistency can make it difficult for the child to understand what their parent’s behavior means and what kind of response to expect, resulting in insecurity and anxiety.

This is where caregivers seek emotional or physical closeness with the child for the purpose of satisfying their own needs. Because of this, they are neglecting the child’s emotional and physical needs.

These caregivers may appear intrusive and preoccupied with their child’s life and can be overprotective. They may replace the actual love and affection of their child with using the child to feed their own needs.

For example, your mother insists on being involved in all your activities with your school friends, wanting to know every detail, and gets upset when you are apart. She tells you that you are her ‘best friend in the whole world.’ As a result, you choose to spend most of your free time with your mother and feel guilty for spending time with others. 

The child, therefore, does not get their needs met and may put everyone else’s needs above their own as this is what they have been used to.

Commonly, children with an anxious attachment style are likely to have parents who are also anxiously attached.

This is likely not due to genetic factors; rather, it is a continuation of behavioral patterns repeated throughout generations.

Moreover, without management, the anxiously attached child may grow up to have their own children who are anxiously attached.

For example, your father does not like to do activities alone and will become distressed if he is left by himself and tends to be clingy with others. You assume this is typical behavior, and as a result, you also do not want to do activities alone. 

It might not always be easy to recognize an anxious attachment style in adults. Some of the key signs include:

Needing constant contact and support from others

A constant need for reassurance that you are good enough

Hypersensitivity to rejection and abandonment

Craving for intimacy, while simultaneously fearing emotional rejection from a partner

Negative self-view or self-worth

The impulse to fix things and solve other people’s problems at one’s own expense

A positive view of others

Ruminate over and overanalyze small things

In romantic relationships, anxious attachment can be triggered by the actions or perceived actions of a partner. 

When triggered, someone with an anxious attachment style may become immediately emotional, jumping to worst-case scenarios about abandonment. They may demand constant reassurance from their partner, become clingy, or act out to regain closeness. 

Since they may have difficulties regulating their emotions, they can appear overly dramatic or cry as a way to communicate their needs.

Some ways in which anxious attachment can be triggered include:

Inconsistent behavior – e.g., if your partner usually gives you a kiss goodnight but then they do not do it one night or when your partner comes home later than expected.

Perceived distance or distraction – e.g., your partner suddenly has more work responsibilities and spends time at home answering emails. 

Forgetfulness – e.g., your partner forgets that it is your anniversary or forgets to pick you up an item from the shop that you requested. 

Not paying attention – e.g., your partner spends a lot of time on their phone when you’re together, or you get a new haircut, but your partner fails to notice anything new. 

Not receiving enough attention – e.g., your partner spends a lot of their free time socializing with friends instead of you.

Getting into arguments – e.g., you argue with your partner about how they haven’t washed the dishes, and you end up reacting by shouting and crying. 

Having trust broken – e.g., you find out that your partner lied about where they were last night. 

These triggers can result in the anxiously attached person feeling even more insecure about their relationship and being filled with more self-doubt.

It may not always be possible to heal an anxious attachment style, but there are some ways in which it can be managed to help you feel more secure in their relationships.

If you have an anxious attachment, you may be more likely to have automatic responses to negativity. However, gaining an awareness of these automatic responses can help you think of a healthier way to respond.

Take time to think about how you feel in a moment and what thoughts come up. Be aware of these thoughts and the meaning that is given to these thoughts. Then, you can consider the best way to respond.

If you feel that you find this difficult, you could even remove yourself from the situation before responding. Go for a walk to gather your thoughts before returning to the situation.

It’s especially helpful to practice being aware of how you interact in relationships to avoid hurting someone’s feelings.

Let’s say your partner is late coming home from work one evening without calling or texting you. You immediately have the thought, “They don’t care about me or respect my time.” This makes you feel angry and hurt.

Instead of reacting right away, pause and try to identify the trigger. Recognize that your anxiety about their lack of communication is triggering an automatic negative assumption.

Dr. Nadine Macaluso has several worksheets on attachment styles and how to heal for better relationships on her website. 

Triggered anxious attachment can put you into fight, flight, or freeze mode. In this state, you cannot think clearly and are more likely to act on impulses. The best method of tackling this is to change your physiology.

Take some time to pause and breathe. You could even place your hands on your belly to connect with the breath. This will send a signal to the brain that you are safe.

When feeling anxious, it can also help to do something grounding so you feel less stuck in your thoughts. Doing exercise, yoga, getting a massage, or going for a walk in nature can help you to feel grounded.

“The first step is learning how to begin to identify your own needs well: what do I want in this situation, what would feel right for me, how do I feel in my body about this decision, does this feel like a good regulated decision or am I just sort of like a ping pong ball reacting?”

Dr Kim Sage, Clinical Psychologist 

Often, it can be beneficial to heal your inner child who first experienced an anxious attachment with a caregiver. This can be done by giving yourself the love, support, and kindness you did not receive as a child.

Be compassionate with yourself, forgive yourself for mistakes, check in with, and comfort yourself if this is what you need.

You can think of this as treating yourself like you would show kindness to an innocent child.

“If you could go back in time and … bring your wisdom and your heart to yourself as a nine-year-old girl, what would you say to her?”

Dr. Diane Poole Heller, Attachment and Trauma Expert

Let’s say you notice your partner seems distracted and less affectionate lately. Your inner child immediately thinks, “They don’t love me anymore.”

Pause and tell yourself gently, “It’s okay; I know that thought is scary, but we don’t know what’s going on yet. Let’s talk to them before assuming the worst.” Then reassure yourself, “No matter what, I’ll be okay. I’m strong and lovable.”

By reparenting with care instead of reacting from fear, you can have a constructive conversation and address the situation calmly.

There are several books to help reparent your inner child, such as the book, ‘Inner Child’ by Tiffany Trieu, which offers journalling activities and reflective practices to help heal from difficult parenting.

When experiencing negative thought patterns, remind yourself that while they seem real, the thoughts are not necessarily true.

Do not believe every negative thought you have and instead try to challenge them when they come up.

Consider what solid evidence there is that your thoughts are true and whether there is a more likely explanation. 

For example, if you have the thought, ‘My partner is going to abandon me because I am unworthy,’ try to provide evidence for and against this claim.

You may come to find that your partner has given you no reason to believe this, and if they were going to abandon you, then they would have done so a long time ago! 

“It’s really challenging those thoughts and also trying to find facts to back this up … when you see something, let’s say your boyfriend didn’t answer or the guy you’re dating didn’t answer you… he could have a work meeting that day; maybe it’s a different schedule.”

Sabrina Zohar, Dating Coach

You can use guidance from CBT worksheets to help guide you through challenging your thoughts. 

Try to take some time every day to do something to take care of yourself. Be consistent with this to soothe your anxiety.

Self-care activities such as engaging in your hobby, taking a long bath, or watching your favorite TV show can help reduce stress and tension.

Self-care can also build internal resources necessary to handle anxiety, such as resilience and recognizing self-worth.

Letting go of your thoughts and putting them into something meaningful can be a healthy way to manage strong emotions. This could be expressed through creating artwork, movement, or music.

Keeping a journal is a helpful method for getting out your emotions, and it may help you recognize some patterns in your thoughts and behaviors.

You could even journal from the perspective of your inner child, writing down why they are sad and what they need.

You can then write from the perspective of an empowered adult self to pass on wisdom, healing, and advice to the inner child.

The way in which you express your emotions does not have to be neat or coherent; even if you just scribble down words on a piece of paper, it can be enough to put a label on what you are feeling.

You can prepare yourself for meaningful conversations ahead of time by exploring nonviolent communication.

This can help you to approach the conversation with honesty as well as kindness so you can make requests without coming across as needy or controlling.

Dr Marshall Rosenberg’s book ‘Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life’ provides guidance for expressing your needs to your partner in an empathetic and healthy way. 

Make an effort to give your partner space and avoid smothering them or making unfair demands. Trust is built gradually, so have patience.

Your partner is not responsible for your anxiety. Owning your feelings and coping with them in a healthy way will help create secure bonds.

Dating coach Sabrina Zohar suggests working on building healthy boundaries in relationships. She suggests looking at where you may be overgiving or sacrificing yourself and starting to pull back when this happens. 

Build a supportive relationship with your partner so that you can openly discuss times when you feel triggered by your anxious attachment:

“Learn how to reach out and say, hey, I’m feeling a little anxious right now, but I’m having this thought: would you mind if I shared it with you, or what do you think about that… working on your communication skills with everyone before you kind of jump to conclusions.”

Dr Kim Sage, Clinical Psychologist

If you need extra support with your anxious attachment style, you can seek help from a therapist. Through therapy, you can learn to recognize your attachment patterns, examine your feelings about yourself and learn to approach relationships with others healthily.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a therapy that focuses on identifying and replacing negative thought patterns and behaviors with healthier ones.

Interpersonal therapy (IPT) helps individuals improve their interpersonal relationships and social interactions.

Also, psychodynamic psychotherapy helps people to focus on unconscious emotional dynamics and can help to examine how attachment styles may present in the therapy relationship itself.

Having an anxious attachment style is not something to feel ashamed of or defective over.

While the anxieties and intense fears of abandonment can feel painful, this attachment style also has positive qualities.

People with anxious styles tend to be very caring, empathetic partners who desire closeness and intimacy. Their heightened sensitivity helps them tune into others’ feelings and needs.

Rather than judging yourself, accept that your attachment style developed as an adaptation to your life experiences.

“Honor that parts of this style are really beautiful; they’re about being loving and being a good caretaker and being mindful of other people… you’re probably overly sensitive to the world and to others, but there is a beauty in that.”

Dr Kim Sage, Clinical Psychologist

With self-awareness and commitment, you can modify unhealthy relational patterns and develop a more secure attachment over time. The key is being patient with yourself and believing you are worthy of love.

Anxious attachment style in romantic relationships can lead to intense stress for both the anxious person and their partner, often resulting in a cycle where anxious individuals may form relationships with avoidant partners. 

Anxious attachment impacts relationships in the following ways:

Two people with anxious attachment styles can date, but this may present unique challenges that require extra effort and understanding from both partners.

Sometimes change can happen when someone who is anxiously attached is in a relationship with someone who is securely attached.

Having a partner who has a secure attachment style can facilitate emotional closeness and a sense of calmness and stability for the anxiously attached. This could help to shift their perception and develop new patterns of thinking and behavior.

Being aware of and making a conscious effort to change negative behavioral patterns can make someone more mindful of how they act in relationships with others. It is important to recognize that the past does not have to predict the present and future experiences.

Although it may not always be possible to change an attachment type that has been present since childhood, anxiously attached individuals can work to feel more secure in themselves and their relationships.

It is not an easy and passive process and will require much conscious effort and self-awareness.

# What is Anxious Attachment in Relationships? (Traits & Triggers)

What is anxious attachment in relationships? 

Do you feel you do everything you can to impress your partner, only to have them pull away? Maybe you’re struggling with jealousy, worried that no matter how hard you try, you’re never good enough, and/ or feel like you have to walk on eggshells around them. If so, you’re in the right place. 

Today, we’re diving into anxious attachment in relationships by defining what this attachment style is, where it comes from, examples of what it looks like, and better yet – how to overcome anxious attachment.

Ready to have all your relationship questions about anxious attachment answered? Let’s get started.

What is your attachment style?

>>TAKE THE QUIZ<<

 

Anxious attachment is one of the four relationship attachment styles. Being anxious in relationships can start from infancy and follow adults throughout their lives. This idea is proved and explained through the attachment theory. 

The attachment theory consists of four unique attachment styles in relationships. All four styles are blueprints for how you’ve learned to give and receive love and they explain your behaviors in adult romantic relationships. 

The attachment theory reveals that these styles are developed during your childhood and formed from the interactions you have with your primary caregivers. Those early-life relationships shape the romantic ones you’ll have as an adult.

The four attachment styles are classified as:



The first three attachment styles (Anxious, Avoidant, and Disorganized) are insecure styles. The fourth style (Secure) is where many strive to be. According to research, people with secure attachment styles tend to be happiest in relationships.

Let’s take a closer look at anxious attachment and what specifically causes that insecure attachment style.

The consensus in the field is that our experiences, especially those of our childhood, often impact our attachment style. How our parents and primary caregivers show us love (or lack thereof) develops our attachment style. It’s common that parents will even pass down their own attachment styles. 

Therefore, anxious attachment is often developed by an anxious or preoccupied parent. The parent likely experienced this attachment style themselves as a child. Anxious parents may have grown up without their own emotional needs being met, which left them feeling empty. As they grow up and have children, they may cling to their baby to fill this emotional void.

Enter the generational cycle of anxious attachment. For example, an anxious parent may overdo it with their child in an attempt to feel love and reassurance from them. In exchange, the child does not internalize a sense of calm and may be left in a state of confusion about whether they can or cannot depend on others. As they grow up, this carries into their romantic relationships and eventually onto their children, and the cycle continues.

However, there are instances where the opposite happens. You might have a child that is temperamentally desirous of more affection than an avoidant or dismissive parent is willing or capable of providing. So, the child grows up to anxiously search for a new parent in their adult romantic partners in an unconscious attempt to heal their inner child (more on that soon).

Now that you know how we develop our attachment styles, let’s break down anxious attachment specifically.

If you’re walking on eggshells or chasing after an unattainable partner, you may be dealing with anxious attachment. Anxious attachment in adults, or what I refer to as Open-Hearted attachment, describes adults who struggle with feelings of unworthiness.

Anxious attachment is often formed from an underlying fear of abandonment and rejection. Often, it’s shown in relationships as a fear of not being good enough and clingy behavior. 

Curious to learn how to spot an Open Heart with anxious attachment? Here are the traits they may display:



Due to your nature of insecurity, you may believe you don’t deserve love, but instead have to earn love and approval. This makes you drawn to challenging partners that make you work for it. On the other hand, if your partner gives you love and affection too freely, you may find them boring and want to move on.

Now that you know what anxious attachment looks like as an individual, let’s see how this attachment style affects relationships.

What is your attachment style?

>>TAKE THE QUIZ<<

 

Your attachment style directly affects your relationships. Attachment styles are a good indicator of how you deal with emotional intimacy, so those with different styles behave differently in relationships. 

So how does anxious attachment affect relationships? Let’s look at some examples.

Earlier, we discussed some traits of the anxious attached individual. Now let’s look at how it plays out within a relationship. 

In an intimate relationship, many anxious adults will make themselves indispensable to their partners. They think “If they need me, they won’t leave me.” They want to feel needed.

But, this backfires. After all the work you put in, you always question whether or not they really love you for YOU.

Within a relationship, Open Hearts struggle with knowing – or showing – the real version of themselves. Their insecure feelings of unworthiness tend to get them lost in the potential of a relationship, rather than seeing the reality of it.

Anxious attachments often mask their true feelings because they are afraid of showing vulnerability. As a result of not having their needs met or their feelings heard, they cause conflict by acting defensively or in provocative ways.



But, the hardest thing for those with anxious attachment in relationships is that they usually attract other partners with insecure attachment styles. This causes what’s called the anxious-avoidant trap. This is where you typically find yourself dating someone that is emotionally unavailable, thus “proving” your deepest fear: that you are unlovable.

By avoiding the anxious-avoidant trap, you can successfully date someone with anxious attachment. But, how? That’s next.

Clients repeatedly ask me, “How can I date someone with anxious attachment?” My advice is to learn some anxious attachment trigger statements and learn how to respond. 

For anxious Open Hearts, avoid triggering statements like:

Instead, try to reassure Open Hearts with statements like: 

Another common, triggering phrase that Open Hearts hate to hear is “You’re overreacting.” Although this phrase is said as an attempt to defuse a tense situation and reduce anxiety, an Open Heart might perceive it as dismissive and devaluing.

Instead, what an Open Heart needs to hear is: “Even if I can’t understand why you’re feeling this way, I know what it’s like to feel overwhelmed. How can I support you?” You and your partner can move forward from this conflict by finding common ground that each of you has felt overwhelmed in life.



When you can learn to reduce the anxiety of your partner and understand that many of their actions come from a place of love, you’ll find greater success – no matter what attachment style they are. For someone with an anxious attachment style, just remember to be there for them. 

Inevitably, your anxious attachment will be triggered. Before you take the blame and get down on yourself, try to take a moment to overcome the trigger. Here are some tips on how to handle being triggered.

The first thing to do is always breathe. Reground yourself in the present moment and pause to notice how you feel within your body. What sensations are there internally? Where do you feel the stress? Just look inward and take a moment to allow yourself to simply feel.

You may feel like you’re being flooded and overwhelmed by your feelings. Rather than reacting and allowing your emotions to boil over, try to leverage body activation. 

What I mean is trying to shift gears in your head and think ahead, instead. This doesn’t mean denying your feelings, but rather switching to positive thoughts. For example, plan your next vacation in your head. Just thinking positively can turn things around quickly.

Another option? Think about being the hero of your own story. You may feel less triggered when you focus on the idea that your happiness is in your control.

Overcoming anxious attachment triggers is possible, but it takes practice. Be gracious and patient with yourself and your partner as you learn these new behaviors. So, let’s talk about overcoming anxious attachment in relationships next. 

Do you want to overcome anxious attachment? You can. With some help, you or your partner can go from “you’re too good for me” to “you make me want to be a better partner.” Let’s discuss actionable steps to help you get started. First, we must address your inner child.

Anxious attachment is developed when we’re children, so healing your inner child is a good place to start. The concept of an inner child is an effective strategy at overcoming anxious attachment because it’s a powerful metaphor. When we struggle in relationships, it’s often our inner child being projected into it.



To heal your inner child, you must look inward. It involves acknowledging and reparenting the suppressed inner child on a spiritual level. You have to gain that inner child’s trust, just as you earn it with anyone else. The inner child has long been unkind and neglected, so on a fundamental level, building this inner trust lets you tap into it.

How? You earn your inner child’s trust through consistent action and behavior. You must create cohesiveness between what you say and what you do by honoring your needs no matter what. You must start to believe that you deserve your needs and are free to feel as you do, no matter what. Basically, you need to stop letting people walk all over you and fight for your inner child. 

Once we claim that child as our own, we commit ourselves to love that child. We must feed that child, defend that child, and give it what it needs to really grow and mature in a healthy way. As a result, we are filled with a deep loving feeling that is both giving and receiving.

In a relationship, you must learn to prioritize your own needs as much as your partners – not more and not less. Otherwise, there will always be a toxic imbalance and you could get stuck in the validation trap. You need to stop looking to others to validate your own growth. You must fix what’s within yourself, then see how that projects onto others.

Healing your inner child can also be accomplished through therapy or creative exercises, like those in my online courses. 

Another method of overcoming anxious attachment in relationships is to self-soothe. This includes learning to cope with jealousy.



As an anxious partner, you may experience jealousy a lot as a result of the nature of your insecurity. You may see your partner experiencing jealousy too, and this just feels like proof positive of reciprocated feelings. 

Jealousy can be interpreted in many different ways. For an anxious Open Heart, jealousy might make them feel closer to their partner, because it’s a powerful emotion that makes them feel alive, crystal clear about their feelings, and laser focused on what they want. If their partner feels jealous, that  makes them feel even more connected, because it seems like proof positive that they care. But for obvious reasons, this lifestyle isn’t going to lead you to a secure relationship style. You must confront jealousy. 

Coping with jealousy via self-soothing begins with realizing that jealousy is often a defensive coping strategy for anxious attachment, and it points to what we are afraid of losing. This fear of loss usually predates your current partner, and/or the object at hand. Healing your inner child will help reveal the root pain of this fear, and help you become more satisfied internally.

Next, it’s important to realize that jealousy can deepen your relationship, if approached in a certain way. If you can be honest about your feelings of jealousy (and all feelings!), this can give your partner a window into your more vulnerable self, and establish a deeper, more secure connection. Now, your partner has an opportunity to make conscious efforts to meet your needs authentically and honestly.

Furthermore, listening to your jealousy may help you gain access to your deepest needs around self-esteem. Feelings of not being good enough, feelings of shame, or fears of failure, or feeling discredited, or disrespected, or undervalued in some way, often lurk behind the umbrella emotion of jealousy. If we can address these subtler emotions with a more nuanced and mindful perspective, it can open you up to experience a much wider and more fulfilling range of emotion, and life satisfaction. Thus, jealousy is a poignant reminder that we need to take care of ourselves. 

It might help to think about why you’re jealous. Are you comparing the worst of what we have to the best of what we perceive someone else has? If so, think back on what we discussed earlier: You are the hero of your own story. Step out of your triggered fog and remember that you are in control of your own emotions.

What is your attachment style?

Introduction

Bowlby’s and Ainsworth’s approach to personality development relied on ethology1,2 and cross-cultural research,3,4 preserving the central questions of traditional psychoanalysis2 and drawing on the concept of mental representation as suggested by cognitive psychology. The ethological approach implies: a) a careful description and classification of infant and child behaviour;5 b) reference to a posited environment of evolutionary adaptedness for humans, as evidenced by young humans’ intense responsiveness to being left alone in a strange environment with strange people; and c) analyzing the function of emotions and behaviours in a social context.6 Ethologically guided observations of sensitivity in remote non-western environments attest to the general applicability of this research approach.7  Attachment serves to ensure protection and care, and secure attachment serves to relieve distress, restore physiological homeostasis and encourage exploration. The impact of attachment in terms of biology and neurobiology has also been documented in recent studies.8,9 For example, it is through attachment relationships, that young children first learn to link emotions to external events in a linguistically meaningful manner. Further, non-pathological attachment relationships are the basis for becoming emotionally, socially and cognitively acculturated.10

In the early years, attachment relationships to parents and consistent caregivers are the predominant and most influential relationships in children’s lives. These relationships set the stage for infants’ physiological functioning, their emotional and cognitive interpretations of social- and non-social experiences, their language development, and their acquisition of meaning about themselves and others in complex social situations. Later, the attachment relationships mediate children’s acceptance and acquisition of their culture.11 Joint attention appears to be the central process;12 it emerges at around nine months, at the height of stranger anxiety. In this way, nature ensures that infants learn first about their family’s culture in the mother tongue. Attachment relationships that were vital for infant survival during human evolution13 continue to influence thoughts, feelings and motives and therefore close relationships throughout life. Early experiences of care, and the attachment relationship with the caregiver, have a long-lasting impact on the child’s reactivity to stress.9

Within the framework of modern evolutionary biology, attachment theory focuses on the “gene-selfish” interest of children in receiving as much of their parents’ physical as well as psychological resources as possible.6,13 In terms of Trivers’14 parent-offspring conflict paradigm, attachment theory focuses on the offspring’s side of the conflict, and on the parent’s willingness or unwillingness to invest in any particular individual offspring. However, parental lifespan planning may help to explain possible differences in parental investment in care and differential parental sensitivity towards different children.15 This may also explain the moderate concordance of patterns of attachment even in monozygotic twins.16

Subject

Attachment theory posits a causal relationship between individuals’ experience with their parents or attachment figures and their capacity to form affectional bonds later on. If a child receives tender loving care when in need, and support for autonomy during exploration from mother as well as father, such experiences are assumed to a) give the child a sense of worth, a belief in the helpfulness of others and enable the child to explore the environment with confidence; b) be an optimal precondition for mutually supportive, enduring adult partnerships; and c) provide a model for later parenthood.10,17 Confident, competent exploration is equivalent to our concept of “secure” exploration.18 Combining the concept of secure attachment with secure exploration yields the concept of “psychological security” that we advocate.18

Problems

Originally, attachment research provided only one method to assess quality of attachment in infancy, using a separation-reunion paradigm (the strange situation). However, research results indicated a low validity of the infant-father strange situation assessment for predicting subsequent psychosocial development.19 Rather, father-child interactive quality during play or exploration, and sensitive challenges to the young child’s competencies seem to be better predictors of child development.20,21,22 Another challenge to attachment research is not only  a measurement issue but mainly  a conceptual as well as an open research question: How do behavioural patterns of infant attachment become patterns of quality  of  verbal discourse about attachment representation later?23

Research Context

Two longitudinal studies of children’s social and emotional development in not-at-risk middle-class two-parent families were started in the mid- and late 1970s: the Bielefeld project, or Project 1, which started with the birth of the infants, and the Regensburg project, or Project 2, which started when the infants were 11 months old.11 The children’s experiences in the domains of attachment and exploration were assessed in infancy, childhood and adolescence, with both mother and father using standardized or free observations. Semi-structured interviews about family matters were conducted with the parents on many occasions and later with the children. Representations of attachment were assessed at ages 10, 16 and 22, representations of friendship at 16, and representations of partnership at 20 or 22. For the analysis of early influences on the representation of close relationships, data on child attachment and exploratory strategies, maternal and paternal sensitivity and support were aggregated for the periods of infancy (birth to age three), childhood (five to 10) and adolescence (16 to 18).11 In addition, we conducted various studies in other cultures,24 adding to the long tradition of cross-cultural research on attachment.25

Key Research Questions

How does the capacity to make affectional bonds develop? How predictive are the qualities of infants’ attachment to mother and father during the first two to three years and their experiences of sensitive support during exploration for adolescents’ and young adults’ partnership representations? What are the roots of young adults’ representation of attachment relationships?

Research Results

Our longitudinal projects revealed several major findings:11

Our own cross-cultural research on Japanese and Trobriand infants confirmed three of the four core hypotheses of attachment theory:25 1) Infant attachment to at least one caring adult is universal; 2) the secure pattern of attachment was also the norm in both groups; and 3) security of attachment is positively related to competence.6,24 In our recent review, we summarize many studies that support the concept of psychological security indicating the combined influence of secure exploration and secure attachment. Psychological security was linked to cognitive competence, flexible gender-role behaviour, as well as resourceful transition and adaptions within the school system.18

Conclusion

Young children’s experiences of sensitive, accepting, supportive mothers and fathers start a pathway of positive psychosocial development for the child. Such experiences in the domains of attachment as well as exploration are at the roots of secure models of close relationships and healthy self-reliance in the academic domain.30 They are likely to be carried forward to other close relationships in childhood, adolescence and young adulthood. Changes in parental acceptance or disruption of the family can alter the pathway in either direction, temporarily or permanently.10,11

The child’s subjective experiences can best be assessed by open-minded, reliable observations of quality of interactions in structured situations3 and by semi-structured interviews that allow for a discovery of new categories. Analyses of the adaptive functioning of the attachment system must focus on adverse experiences, irritations and negative emotions. Analyses of secure exploration must focus on challenges to the child’s competencies31 and address co-construction of meaning together with familiar figures.32 Appropriate emotional responses to real events and attempted appropriate solutions with the help of other trusted persons are reliable indicators of security of exploration. 

Implications for the Policy and Services Perspective

Throughout the early years, caregiver sensitivity implies an understanding and correct interpretation of and prompt and appropriate responses to the young child’s non-verbal as well as verbal expressions. A prerequisite for sensitivity is pacing the interactions according to the child’s rhythms, in both good and bad moods. Variations in the quality of maternal caregiving shape the neurobiological systems that regulate stress reactions.9 Higher sensitivity was found in mothers and fathers who valued attachments based on their recollections of being accepted themselves and sensitively cared for as a child.29 Likewise, in close relationships with non-parental caregivers or mentors in which the child feels safe and secure, the child will make ample use of joint attention to social and non-social objects and events. Learning is most effective if the child feels valued by the mediating person.33 

Parents who have experienced difficult childhoods themselves or who have an infant with special needs benefit from help in three pivotal domains: 1) understanding child development in all domains; 2) learning to respond sensitively to their individual child;34,35 3) finding enjoyment and sufficient time for sensitive, supportive interactions with the child in attachment- and exploration-relevant situations. In subsequent years, support in more domains become important, such as finding invested, knowledgeable mentors and educators for the child and monitoring the child’s friendship group. This is especially important when parents’ own education or acculturation leave too many gaps. Secure attachment is a necessary but not sufficient prerequisite for becoming a cooperative, valuable and accepted member of one’s group and society. Secure exploration must complement secure attachments so that children can successfully meet the many challenges posed by their social relationships as well as by their cultural demands.

Two days after my daughter was born, in Milan, Italy, I was in the hospital nursery room. When I was there, another baby girl was ready to go home with her parents, when her dad said, loudly (in Italian), “Can you see how all the other babies and parents are happy to see you go finally, so they can stop hearing you cry? We cannot hold you all the time darling, life is painful, so you’d better get used to it”. 

I found these words very stressful, and, although it may have been an isolated episode for a new parent, I started to think about what this girl could experience going forward, if this style of parental relationship continued. She most likely would not feel understood, listened to, or supported by others. This episode reminded me once again of the importance of sensitive parent-infant relationships starting from the very beginning.

I am psychologist, with a PhD in perinatal psychiatry at King’s College London, and my work has always focused on the mother-infant relationship and infant development. In the past few years, I have worked on different research projects on perinatal mental illness, investigating both risk factors and the potential impact on the mother-infant relationship and the infant's development. 

I have previously written about these topics in Inspire the Mind, and was also inspired by the birth of my own daughter two years ago, and so I have decided to launch this column (the Perinatal Journey - Walking through the first years of life) dedicated to parenthood and infant development. As I explained in my interview with fellow researcher and ITM writer Zuzanna Zajkowska, this column will focus on the perinatal period and the first years of life, a time so incredibly important for infant development.

Research has now documented how the first 1001 days (from conception to around age two) are an extremely sensitive period for a child’s future development. During this time, babies are growing very fast, and their brains are being shaped by the experiences they have with their parents and the environment around them.

Babies are in fact highly dependent on their caregivers. The type of relationship they develop with their parents early on will be internalised and will guide their future development and relationships, as well as their mental and physical health. This may seem a strong statement to make, but we indeed know from many studies that sensitive parent-infant relationships sustain offspring’s physical and mental health, through childhood, adolescence and adulthood. For example, sensitive relationships predict better infant social and cognitive abilities, good (secure) attachment towards the caregiver, lower risk for problems at school, and for mental health problems in childhood, as well as better development during the lifetime. Conversely, infants who have not experienced a sensitive relationship are at greater risk of less optimal mental health outcomes during their lifetime.

Using simple words, in a sensitive parent-infant relationship, the caregiver (usually a parent) values, understands, and responds appropriately to the child’s signals and needs, adjusting her behaviour to comfort the infant and reduce her distress and disengagement.

The experience of a sensitive and consistent relationship with a caregiver will make the infant feel content, understood, and secure.  As time passes, the infant will be able to use this relationship as a “secure base”, from which to explore the environment and open-up to the world, but also a place to return for comfort and reassurance, certain that the caregiver will be there to help in case of need.

Because of this early positive relationship with their caregiver, the infants’ internal representation of themselves, the world, and others will generally be positive and, therefore, they will be more likely to be able to explore and interact successfully with other adults and children, to show empathy and social-emotional engagement and have good self-esteem. Growing up, the child will also be more likely to successfully deal with negative emotions and stressful situations independently, while also be able to return to the caregivers if needed.

In adult life, these characteristics will remain.

Therefore, adults who had sensitive parents will generally be more likely to have good self-esteem, to form positive intimate relationships, to succeed in their studies and career, to manage stress and emotions, and to remain resilient in the face of difficult situations, reducing the risk of suffering from both mental and physical disorders.

Of course, this is not a deterministic, univocal association, as many other factors influence the course of development. Some resilient adults might have had a difficult childhood, and some adults who grew up in optimal parental conditions may manifest mental health vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, the association between sensitive parenting and better health is undeniable – this is why it is so important that everyone knows about it. 

Responding to a baby in a sensitive and consistent way is crucial for the infant. Common advice given, such as: “don’t hold the baby too much, don’t respond to her every time she cries, otherwise she will be spoiled and will never be independent”, is now considered false. There is no scientific evidence supporting the idea that a mother can respond “too much” to a baby. In fact, the opposite is true: the more an infant receives consistent and sensitive responses to their needs, the more they will be able to grow-up as an independent adult.

Of course, it is important to highlight that the caregiver does not need to be perfect but just “good enough” for the child, using the words of the paediatrician and child psychoanalyst, Dr. Winnicott. There are in fact many practical life situations where the caregiver cannot always respond in the best way to the baby. It is the caregivers’ repeated, regular failure to respond to the baby that can generate problems.

It is also important to mention that taking care of a baby in a sensitive way is a demanding job for a parent, even in the best of circumstances. All of this is a process and requires time for adjustment, and this is why the role of the support network is essential for a family when a baby is born. As another ITM writer has reminded us,  “it does take a village to raise a child”.

Difficulties in the parent-infant relationship can develop even in the best of circumstances and are even more likely when vulnerability factors are present.

Many factors can increase the risk of parent-infant relationship difficulties, by directly affecting the interaction or, indirectly, by increasing the probability of maternal mental health problems, such as depression during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. Depression can represent a risk for the mother-infant relationship and the infant secure attachment, particularly when the illness is prolonged and severe.

Other factors include the caregiver having a difficult relationship with their own parents in childhood, or with their current partner, lack of support, socio-economic disadvantage, stressful events, and severe pregnancy/delivery complications. In these situations, it can be harder for the parent to provide an attuned response to the baby, and the more vulnerability factors are present, the more difficult it can be.

When difficulties arise, it is important to intervene as early as possible with supporting interventions dedicated to improve the mother-infant relationship and infant security. We will discuss possible interventions in one of the next articles.

“Good enough” parenting is a strong protective factor for infant long-term development. If you would like to know more about this – to receive compassionate, evidence-based advice on parenting – come back to my monthly column!

# What is a Secure Attachment? And Why Doesn’t "Attachment Parenting" Get You There? — Developmental Science

photo credit: Emily Dorrien

A few months ago, a young friend of mine had a baby. She began a home birth with a midwife, but after several hours of labor, the baby turned to the side and became stuck. The midwife understood that the labor wouldn’t proceed, so she hustled the laboring Amelie into the car and drove the half-mile to the emergency room while Amelie’s husband followed. The birth ended safely, and beautiful, tiny Sylvie emerged with a full head of black hair. The little family of three went home.

When the baby was six weeks old, Amelie developed a severe breast infection. She struggled to continue breastfeeding and pumping, but it was extremely painful, and she was taking antibiotics.[1] Finally she gave in to feeding her baby formula, but she felt distraught and guilty. “Make sure you find some other way to bond with your baby,” her pediatrician said, adding to her distress.

Fortunately, sleep came easily to Sylvie; she slumbered comfortably in a little crib next to Amelie’s side of the bed. Still, at four months, Amelie worried that the bond with her baby wasn’t forming properly and she wanted to remedy the problem by pulling the baby into bed. Baby Sylvie wasn’t having it. When she was next to her mother, she fussed; when Amelie placed her back in the crib, she settled. Again, Amelie worried about their relationship.

“Amelie” is an amalgam of actual friends and clients I have seen in the last month, but all of the experiences are real. And as a developmental psychologist, I feel distressed by this suffering. Because while each of the practices—home birth, breastfeeding, and co-sleeping—has its benefits, none of them is related to a baby’s secure attachment with her caregiver, nor are they predictive of a baby’s mental health and development.

“Attachment is not a set of tricks,” says Alan Sroufe, a developmental psychologist at the Institute for Child Development at the University of Minnesota. He should know. He and his colleagues have studied the attachment relationship for over 40 years.

Why the confusion about a secure attachment?

Over the last 80 years, developmental scientists have come to understand that some micro-dynamics that take place between a baby and an adult in a caring relationship have a lifelong effect, in very specific ways, on the person that baby will become.

“Attachment,” Sroufe explains, “is a relationship in the service of a baby’s emotion regulation and exploration. It is the deep, abiding confidence a baby has in the availability and responsiveness of the caregiver.”

A secure attachment has at least three functions:

Provides a sense of safety and security

Regulates emotions, by soothing distress, creating joy, and supporting calm

Offers a secure base from which to explore

In spite of the long scientific history of attachment, psychologists have done a rather poor job of communicating what a secure attachment is and how to create one. In the meantime, the word “attachment” has been co-opted by a well-meaning pediatrician and his wife, William and Martha Sears, along with some of their children and an entire parenting movement. The “attachment parenting” philosophy promotes a lifestyle and a specific set of practices that are not proven to be related to a secure attachment. As a result, the movement has sown confusion (and guilt and stress) around the meaning of the word “attachment.” 

The attachment parenting philosophy inspired by the Searses and promoted by an organization called Attachment Parenting International is centered on eight principle concepts, especially breastfeeding, co-sleeping, constant contact like baby-wearing, and emotional responsiveness. The approach is a well-intentioned reaction to earlier, harsher parenting advice, and the tone of the guidance tends to be baby-centered, supportive, and loving. Some of the practices are beneficial for reasons other than attachment. But the advice is often taken literally and to the extreme, as in the case of my “Amelie,” whose labor required hospital intervention and who suffered unduly in the belief that breastfeeding and co-sleeping are necessary for a secure attachment.

Attachment parenting has also been roundly critiqued for promoting a conservative Christian, patriarchal family structure that keeps women at home and tied tightly to their baby’s desires. Additionally, the philosophy seems to have morphed in the public consciousness into a lifestyle that also includes organic food, cloth diapers, rejection of vaccinations, and homeschooling. The Searses have sold millions of books, and they profit from endorsements of products that serve their advice.

“These [attachment parenting principles] are all fine things,” observes Sroufe “but they’re not the essential things. There is no evidence that they are predictive of a secure attachment.”

Sroufe unpacks feeding as an example: A mother could breastfeed, but do it in a mechanical and insensitive way, potentially contributing to an insecure attachment. On the other hand, she could bottle-feed in a sensitive manner, taking cues from the baby and using the interaction as an opportunity to look, talk, and play gently, according to the baby’s communication—all behaviors that are likely to create secure attachment. In other words, it is the quality of the interaction that matters. Now, one might choose breastfeeding for its digestibility or nutrition (though the long-term benefits are still debated), but to imply, as Amelie’s pediatrician did, that bottle-feeding could damage her bond with her baby is simply uninformed.

There is also confusion about what “constant contact” means. Early on, the Searses were influenced by the continuum concept, a “natural” approach to parenting inspired by indigenous practices of wearing or carrying babies much of the time. This, too, might have been taken up in reaction to the advice of the day, which was to treat children in a more businesslike manner. There is no arguing that skin-to-skin contact, close physical contact, holding, and carrying are all good for babies in the first few months of life, as their physiological systems settle and organize. Research also shows that the practice can reduce crying in the first few months. But again, what matters for attachment is the caregiver’s orientation and attunement: Is the caregiver stressed or calm, checked out or engaged, and are they reading a baby’s signals? Some parents misinterpret the prescription for closeness as a demand for constant physical closeness (which in the extreme can stress any parent), even though the Searses do advise parents to strive for a balanced life.

“There’s a difference between a ‘tight’ connection and a secure attachment,” Sroufe explains. “A tight attachment—together all the time—might actually be an anxious attachment.”

And what of emotional responsivity? This, too, has a kernel of truth, yet can be taken too far. It is safe to say that all developmental scientists encourage emotional responsiveness on the part of caregivers: The back-and-forth, or serve-and-return, is crucial to brain development, cognitive and emotional development, the stress regulation system, and just authentic human connection. But in my observation, well-meaning parents can become overly-responsive—or permissive—in the belief that they need to meet every request of the child. While that is appropriate for babies in the first half to one-year year of life (you can’t spoil a baby), toddlers and older children benefit from age-appropriate limits in combination with warmth and love. On the other hand, some parents feel stressed that they cannot give their child enough in the midst of their other responsibilities. Those parents can take some comfort in the finding that even within a secure attachment, parents are only attuned to the baby about 30% of the time. What is important, researchers say, is that the baby develops a generalized trust that their caregiver will respond and meet their needs, or that when mismatches occur, the caregiver will repair them (and babies, themselves, will go a long way toward soliciting that repair). As long as the caregiver returns to the interaction much of the time and rights the baby’s boat, this flow of attunements, mismatches, and repairs offers the optimal amount of connection and stress for a baby to develop both confidence and coping, in balance.

What is the scientific view of attachment?

The scientific notion of attachment has its roots in the work of an English psychiatrist named John Bowlby who, in the 1930s, began working with children with emotional problems. Most professionals of the day held the Freudian belief that children were mainly motivated by internal drives like hunger, aggression, and sexuality, and not by their environment. However, Bowlby noticed that most of the troubled children in his care were “affectionless” and had experienced disrupted or even absent caregiving. Though his supervisor forbade him from even talking to a mother of a child (!), he insisted that family experiences were important, and in 1944 he wrote his first account of his observations based on 44 boys in his care. (Around the same time in America, psychologist Harry Harlow was coming to the same conclusion in his fascinating and heart-rending studies of baby monkeys, where he observed that babies sought comfort, and not just food, from their mothers.)  

Bowlby went on to study and treat other children who were separated from their parents: those who were hospitalized or homeless. He came to believe that the primary caregiver (he focused mainly on mothers) served as a kind of “psychic organizer” to the child, and that a child needs this influence, especially at certain times, in order to develop successfully. To grow up mentally healthy, then, “the infant and young child should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with this mother (or permanent mother substitute) in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment.”

But the attachment figure doesn’t have to be the mother or even a parent. According to Bowlby, babies form a “small hierarchy of attachments.” This makes sense from an evolutionary view: The number has to be small since attachment organizes emotions and behavior in the baby, and to have too many attachments would be confusing; yet having multiples provides the safety of backups. And it’s a hierarchy because when the baby is in need of safety, he or she doesn’t have time to analyze the pros or cons of a particular person and must automatically turn to the person already determined to be a reliable comfort. Research shows that children who have a secure attachment with at least one adult experience benefits. Babies can form attachments with older siblings, fathers, grandparents, other relatives, a special adult outside the family, and even babysitters and daycare providers. However, there will still be a hierarchy, and under normal circumstances, a parent is usually at the top.

In the 1950s, Mary Ainsworth joined Bowlby in England, and a decade later back in the U.S. began to diagnose different kinds of relationship patterns between children and their mothers in the second year of life.[2] She did this by watching how babies reacted in a sequence of situations: when the baby and mother were together, when they were separated, when the baby was with a stranger, and when baby was reunited with the caregiver after the separation. Ainsworth and colleagues identified the first three of the following patterns, and Mary Main and colleagues identified the fourth:

When babies have a secure attachment, they play and explore freely from the “secure base” of their mother’s presence. When the mother leaves, the baby can become distressed, especially when a stranger is around. When the mother returns, the baby expresses her joy, sometimes from a distance and sometimes reaching to be picked up and held (babies vary, depending on their personality and temperament, even within a secure attachment). Then the baby settles quickly and returns to playing.

The mothers who fall into this pattern are responsive, warm, loving, and emotionally available, and as a result their babies grow to be confident in their mothers’ ability to handle feelings. The babies feel free to express their positive and negative feelings openly and don’t develop defenses against the unpleasant ones.

Babies in insecure-avoidant attachments seem indifferent to the mother, act unstressed when she leaves, and exhibit the same behaviors with a stranger. When the mother returns after a separation, the baby might avoid her, or might “fail to cling” when picked up.

The mothers in insecure-avoidant attachments often seem angry in general and angry, specifically, at their babies. They can be intolerant, sometimes punishing, of distress, and often attribute wrong motivations to the baby, e.g., “He’s just crying to spite me.” One study showed that the insecurely-attached babies are just as physiologically upset (increased heart rates, etc.) as securely attached babies when parents leave but have learned to suppress their emotions in order to stay close to the parent without risking rejection. In other words, the babies “deactivate” their normal attachment system and stop looking to their mothers for help.

As toddlers, insecure-avoidant children don’t pay much attention to their mothers or their own feelings, and their explorations of the physical world are rigid and self-reliant. By preschool, these children tend to be more hostile, aggressive, and have more negative interactions overall. Avoidance and emotional distance become a way of dealing with the world, and instead of problem-solving, they are more likely to sulk or withdraw.

Babies with an insecure-ambivalent/resistant attachment are clingy with their mother and don’t explore or play in her presence. They are distressed when the mother leaves, and when she returns, they vacillate between clinging and angry resistance. For example, they may struggle, hit, or push back when the mother picks them up.

These babies are not easily comforted. They seem to want the close relationship, but the mother’s inconsistency and insensitivity undermine the baby’s confidence in her responses. This pattern also undermines the child’s autonomy, because the baby stays focused on the mother’s behavior and changing moods to the exclusion of nearly everything else. In insecure-ambivalent babies, separation anxiety tends to last long after secure babies have mastered it. Longitudinal studies show that these children often become inhibited, withdrawn, and unassertive, and they have poor interpersonal skills.

The last pattern of insecure attachment—which is the most disturbing and destructive—is disorganized attachment, and it was described by Ainsworth’s doctoral student, Mary Main. This pattern can occur in families where there is abuse or maltreatment; the mother, who is supposed to be a source of support, is also the person who frightens the child. Such mothers may be directly maltreating the child, or they might have their own histories of unresolved trauma. Main and her colleague write, “[T]he infant is presented with an irresolvable paradox wherein the haven of safety is at once the source of alarm.”

This pattern can also result when the mother has a mental illness, substance addiction, or multiple risk factors like poverty, substance abuse and a history of being mistreated. Babies of mothers like this can be flooded with anxiety; alternatively, they can be “checked out” or dissociated, showing a flat, expressionless affect or odd, frozen postures, even when held by the mother. Later these children tend to become controlling and aggressive, and dissociation remains a preferred defense mechanism.[3]

How important is attachment? 

“Nothing is more important than the attachment relationship,” says Alan Sroufe, who, together with colleagues, performed a series of landmark studies to discover the long-term impact of a secure attachment. Over a 35-year period, the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaption (MLSRA) revealed that the quality of the early attachment reverberated well into later childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, even when temperament and social class were accounted for.

One of the most important—and, to some ways of thinking, paradoxical—findings was that a secure attachment early in life led to greater independence later, whereas an insecure attachment led to a child being more dependent later in life. This conclusion runs counter to the conventional wisdom held by some people I’ve observed who are especially eager to make the baby as independent and self-sufficient as possible right from the start. But there is no pushing independence, Sroufe found. It blooms naturally out of a secure attachment.

In school, securely attached children were more well-liked and treated better, by both their peers and their teachers. In one study, teachers who had no knowledge of a child’s attachment history were shown to treat securely attached children with more warmth and respect, set more age-appropriate standards, and have higher expectations. In contrast, teachers were more controlling, had lower expectations, got angry more often, and showed less nurturing toward the children with difficult attachments—and who, sadly, had a greater need than the securely attached kids for kindness from adults.

The MSLRA studies showed that children with a secure attachment history were more likely to develop:[4]

A greater sense of self-agency

Better emotional regulation

Higher self-esteem

Better coping under stress

More positive engagement in the preschool peer group

Closer friendships in middle childhood

Better coordination of friendships and social groups in adolescence

More trusting, non-hostile romantic relationships in adulthood

Greater social competence

More leadership qualities

Happier and better relationships with parents and siblings

Greater trust in life

A large body of additional research suggests that a child’s early attachment affects the quality of their adult relationships, and a recent longitudinal study of 81 men showed that those who grew up in warm, secure families were more likely to have secure attachments with romantic partners well into their 70s and 80s. A parent’s history of childhood attachment can also affect their ability to parent their own child, creating a cross-generational transmission of attachment styles.

But early childhood attachment with a parent is not destiny: It depends on what else comes along. For example, a secure preschool child can shift to having an insecure attachment later if there is a severe disruption in the caregiving system—a divorce or death of a parent, for example. But the effect is mediated by how stressed and available the primary attachment figure is. In other words, it’s not what happens, but how it happens that matters. Children who were previously secure, though, have a tendency to rebound more easily.

Sroufe writes in several articles that an insecure attachment is not fate, either; it can be repaired in a subsequent relationship. For example, good-quality childcare that offers emotional support and stress reduction can mitigate a rocky start at home. A later healthy romantic relationship can offset the effects of a difficult childhood. And good therapy can help, too, since some of the therapeutic process mimics the attachment process. Bowlby viewed development as a series of pathways, constrained by paths previously taken but where change is always possible.

Without conscious intervention, though, attachment styles do tend to get passed through the generations, and Bowlby observed that becoming a parent particularly activates a parent’s childhood attachment style. One study looked at attachment styles over three generations and found that the mother’s attachment style when she was pregnant predicted her baby’s attachment style at one year of age for about 70% of cases.

What about parents who might not have gotten a good start in life and want to change their attachment style? There’s good news. Research on adult attachment shows that it is not the actual childhood experiences with attachment that matter but rather how well the adult understands what happened to them, whether they’ve learned some new ways of relating, and how well they’ve integrated their experience into the present. In other words, do they have a coherent and realistic story (including both good and bad) of where they’ve been and where they are now?

Support matters, too. In one of Sroufe’s studies, half the mothers were teenagers, which is usually a stressful situation. Sroufe found that the teenagers with good social support were able to form secure attachments with their babies, but if they didn’t have support, they were unlikely to form a secure attachment.

How to parent for a secure attachment and how to know if it’s working.

“The baby needs to know that they’re massively important,” says Sroufe. “A caregiver should be involved, attentive, sensitive, and responsive.”

“The baby will tell you what to do,” Sroufe explains. “They have a limited way of expressing their needs, so they’re not that difficult to read: If they’re fussing, they need something. If their arms are out, they want to be picked up. And if you misread them, they will keep on signaling until you get it right.” He gives the example of bottle-feeding a baby: “The baby might want a break, and she looks around. What does the baby want? To look around! If the parent misreads and forces the bottle back, the baby will insist, maybe snap her head away, or pull away harder.”

“How can I know if my baby is securely attached?” a client asked me about her six-month old. Clearly observable attachment doesn’t emerge until around nine months, but here are some clues that a secure attachment is underway:

0-3 months:

The baby’s physiology is just settling as the baby cycles quickly among feeding, sleeping, and alert wakefulness. Meeting the baby’s needs at different points in the cycle helps establish stability.

At this point, the baby has no clear preference for one person over another.

In her quiet, alert state, the baby is interested in the faces and voices around her.

4-8 months:

Attempts to soothe the baby are usually effective at calming her down. (Caveat: An inability to soothe might not be predictive of insecurity but rather point to one of a host of other possible issues.)

The primary caregiver has positive interactions with the baby where the back-and-forth is pleasant.

The baby has calm periods where she is interested in the world around her, and she explores and experiments to the extent she is physically able to—looking, grasping, reaching, babbling, beginning crawling, exploring objects with her mouth, hands, etc.

Infants begin to discriminate between people and start to show preferences. They direct most of their emotions (smiles, cries) toward the caregiver but are still interested in strangers.

They are very interested in the people they see often, especially siblings.

9 months:

The baby shows a clear preference for a primary caregiver.

The baby shows wariness toward strangers, though the degree varies with temperament.

The baby is easily upset when separated from her primary caregiver, though that, too, varies with temperament.

The baby is easily soothed after a separation and can resume her exploration or play.

9 months – 3 years:

The child shows a clear emotional bond with a primary person.

The child stays in close proximity to that person but forms close relationships with other people who are around a lot, too, e.g., babysitter, siblings.

Beyond this age, the attachment relationship becomes more elaborated. With language and memory, the rhythms of attachment and separation become more negotiated, talked about, and planned, and there is more of a back-and-forth between parent and child. By toddlerhood and beyond, an authoritative parenting style deftly blends secure attachment with age-appropriate limits and supports. A sensitive parent allows the changing attachment to grow and stretch with a child’s growing skills, yet continues to be emotionally attuned to the child and to protect their safety.

One of the best resources for how to parent for a secure attachment in the first few years of life is the new book Raising A Secure Child by Kent Hoffman, Glen Cooper, and Bert Powell, all therapists who have worked with many different kinds of families for decades. Their work is based squarely on the science of attachment, and they call their approach the Circle of Security. The circle represents the seamless ebb and flow of how babies and young children need their caregivers, at times coming close for care and comfort, and at other times following their inspiration to explore the world around them. The caregivers’ role is to tune into where on the circle their child is at the moment and act accordingly. Parenting for a secure attachment, the authors say, is not a prescriptive set of behaviors but more a state of mind, a way of “being with” the baby, a sensitivity to what they are feeling. The authors also help parents see the ways that their own attachment history shows up in their parenting and help them to make the necessary adjustments.

The neurobiology of attachment

“Attachment theory is essentially a theory of regulation,” explains Allan Schore, a developmental neuroscientist in the Department of Psychiatry at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine. A clinician-scientist, he has elaborated modern attachment theory over the last three decades by explaining how the attachment relationship is important to the child’s developing brain and body.

Early brain development, Schore explains, is not driven just by genetics. The brain needs social experiences to take shape. “Mother Nature and Mother Nurture combine to shape Human Nature,” he writes.

Infants grow new synapses, or neural connections, at a rate of 40,000 new synapses a second, and the brain more than doubles in volume across the first year. Genetic factors drive this early overproduction of neurons, Schore explains, but the brain awaits direction from the social environment, or epigenetic processes, to determine which synapses or connections are to be pruned, which should be maintained, and which genes are turned on or off.

One of the first areas of the brain that begins to grow and differentiate is the right brain, the hemisphere that processes emotional and social information. The right brain begins to differentiate in the last trimester in utero, whereas the left-brain development picks up in the second year of life. Some of the regions that process emotion are already present in infants’ brains at birth—the amygdala, hypothalamus, insula, cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. But the connections among these areas develop in specific patterns over the first years of life. That’s where input from the primary relationship becomes crucial—organizing the hierarchical circuitry that will eventually process, communicate, and regulate social and emotional information.[5]

“What the primary caregiver is doing, in being with the baby,” explains Schore, “is allowing the child to feel and to identify in his own body these different emotional states. By having a caregiver simply ‘be with’ him while he feels emotions and has experiences, the baby learns how to be,” Schore says.

The part of the brain that the primary caregiver uses for intuition, feeling, and empathy to attune to the infant is also the caregiver’s right brain. So it is through “right-brain-to-right brain” reading of each other, that the parent and child synchronize their energy, emotions, and communication. And the behaviors that parents are inclined to do naturally—like eye contact and face-to-face interaction, speaking in “motherese” (higher-pitched and slower than normal speech), and holding—are just the ones shown to grow the right-brain regions in the baby that influence emotional life and especially emotion regulation.

The evidence for epigenetic effects on emotion regulation is quite solid: Early caregiving experiences can affect the expression of the genes that regulate a baby’s stress and they can shape how the endocrine system will mobilize to stress. Caregiving behaviors like responsiveness affect the development of the baby’s vagal tone (the calming system) and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (the system that activates the body to respond to perceived danger). High quality caregiving, then, modulates how the brain and body respond to and manage stress.

Schore points out that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a brain region in the right hemisphere, both has the most complex emotion and stress-regulating systems of any part in the brain and is also the center of Bowlby’s attachment control system. Neurobiological research confirms that this region is “specifically influenced by the social environment.” [6]

Stress management is not the only important part of emotion regulation. In the past, Schore explains, there was an overemphasis in the field of emotion regulation on singularly lowering the baby’s distress. But now, he says, we understand that supporting positive emotional states is equally important to creating [what he quotes a colleague as calling] a “background state of well-being.” In other words, enjoy your baby. It’s protective.

A baby’s emotion regulation begins with the caregiver, and the Goldilocks principle applies: If the caregiver’s emotions are too high, the stimulation could be intrusive to the baby, Schore explains. Too low, and the baby’s “background state” settles at a low or possibly depressive emotional baseline. Just right, from the baby’s point of view is best.

And babies are surprisingly perceptive at registering their feeling environment. Hoffman, Cooper and Powell write:

The youngest babies can sense ease versus impatience, delight versus resentment or irritation, comfort versus restlessness, genuine versus pretending, or other positive versus negative responses in a parent when these reactions aren’t evident to a casual observer. Little babies may pick up on the smallest sigh, the subtlest shift in tone of voice, a certain glance, or some type of body language and know the parent is genuinely comfortable or definitely not pleased.

Schore explains that in a secure attachment, the baby learns to self-regulate in two ways: One he calls “autoregulation” which is self-soothing, or using his own mind and body to manage feelings. The second is “interactive regulation” which is going to other people to help up- or down-regulate feelings. This twin thread of self-reliance and reliance on others, then, begins in the earliest months, becomes very important in the first two years of life, and continues in more subtle ways throughout the life span.

This all might sound daunting for a new parent, who could still be tempted to overdo the focus on the infant and how the connection is going—potentially leading to the same kinds of stress and guilt that the attachment parenting movement creates.

But fortunately, the caregiver doesn’t have to be 100% attuned to the baby and ongoing repairs are an important part of the process:

“The idea that a mother should never stress a baby is problematic,” Schore says. “Insecure attachments aren’t created just by a caregiver’s inattention or missteps. It also comes from a failure to repair ruptures. What is essential is the repair. Maybe the caregiver is coming in too fast and needs to back off, or maybe the caregiver has not responded, and needs to show the baby that she’s there. Either way, repair is possible, and it works. Stress is a part of life, and what we’re trying to do here is to set up a system by which the baby can learn how to cope with stress.”  Optimal stress, he explains, is important for stimulating the stress-regulating system.

Still, both Sroufe and Schore acknowledge the emotional labor of parenting. And they are vehement that parents need to be supported in order to have the space and freedom to care for babies.

“It takes time for parents to learn to read their baby’s signals,” Sroufe said.

Schore calls America’s failure to provide paid family leave—and we’re the only country in the world that doesn’t—the “shame of America.”

“We are putting the next generation at risk,” he explains, pointing to rising rates of insecure attachments and plummeting mental health among American youth. Parents should have at least six months of paid leave and job protection for the primary caregiver, and at least two months of the same for the secondary one, according to Schore, and Sroufe goes further, advocating for one full year of paid leave and job protection. And a recent study showed that it takes mothers a year to recover from pregnancy and delivery.

Intellectual and cognitive development have been privileged in our society, but it is our emotion regulation that organizes us, our existence, and how we experience life, Schore says. A study from the London School of Economics draws the conclusion that “The most important childhood predictor of adult life-satisfaction is the child’s emotional health…. The least powerful predictor is the child’s intellectual development.”[7] 

So where does this leave my friend Amelie?  The hard part will be navigating the distracting advice and creating the workarounds she needs for the lack of cultural support. But she enjoys her baby immensely, and I’m confident that she’ll form a secure attachment with Sylvie, as she trusts her own “right-brain” flow of empathy, feeling, and being, and tunes in to Sylvie’s own unique ways of communicating.

And Sylvie will do her part to draw her parents close. Because regardless of babies’ individual personalities—and whether they cry a lot or sleep very little, whether they’re breastfed or bottle-fed—they draw you in with their wide-open gaze, their milky scent, and their tiny fingers that curl around your big ones. Before you know it, they light you up with their full-body smile that’s specially for you, and they draw you near with their plump little arms clasped around your neck.

And the sweet elixir of the attachment relationship is underway.

# Attachment Theory: Parent-Child Attachment Affects Relationship Skills Throughout Life

Parent-child attachment is a concept that greatly influences a child’s interactions with others throughout their lifetime.

A child develops an attachment with anyone who they spend time with on a regular basis.

In the 1950s, the idea of attachment theory was developed.

John Bowlby, a psychoanalyst, described the term “attachment” in the context of infant-parent relationships.

Bowlby explored the behaviors that an infant displayed in relation to their parent, such as screaming, clinging, or crying. He believed these behaviors were reinforced through natural selection with the purpose of helping the infant to survive.

It was thought that without these types of behaviors some infants could be left alone too long potentially putting them at risk of danger.

The behaviors that an infant engages in in order to attach with a caregiver make up what Bowlby called the “attachment behavioral system.”

A person’s attachment behavioral system is the foundation of how they form and maintain relationships with others.

Research has explored an infant’s attachment style by separating infants from their caregiver and observing their behavior. Typically, in these situations, an infant will react in one of four ways.

The four attachment styles include:

Infants with a secure attachment generally become distressed when separated from their caregiver, but they seek and receive comfort when they are reunited with the caregiver.

Infants with an anxious-resistant attachment generally become more distressed (as compared to securely attached infants). They also try to seek comfort from parents may be have more troublesome behaviors, as well.

Infants with an avoidant attachment generally do not become distressed when separated from their caregiver. They typically do not attend to their caregiver or they actively ignore their caregiver when the caregiver returns.

Infants with a disorganized-disoriented attachment do not show a predictable pattern of behavior when their parent leaves and returns.

The attachment style that an infant experiences plays a role in the type of relationships they will have in childhood and adulthood.

Bowlby believed that children could be better served with professional supports when the clinician looked at a bigger picture, when they considered environmental, setting, and social factors and how these things related to the child’s behaviors.

Bowlby’s ideas led to an increase in helping parents to make positive changes in the child’s environment including in the way in which parents interacted with their child.

Mary Ainsworth, who also studied children and their relationships with their parents, aided Bowlby in developing attachment theory. Together, they completed a large amount of research to support their theory.

One experiment completed that supported attachment theory was done with rhesus monkeys. Harry Harlow studied relationships between parents and their children and used monkeys as research participants.

Harlow explored how a parent-child relationship (particularly with a mother) was based on emotion rather than just physiological need.

Harlow found that when a monkey was taken away from its biological mother after birth and then offered a surrogate mother made of wire mesh which provided milk, the monkey would choose the surrogate mother covered in soft cloth rather than the wire mesh-only surrogate.

In another study, Harlow found that monkeys would return to a soft cloth surrogate mother when they heard a loud noise. However, monkeys who were given a bare wire mesh surrogate mother would behave in other ways, such as throwing themselves to the ground, rocking back and forth, or screaming.

The monkey studies supported the idea that parent-child attachment should include physical closeness and responsiveness to create an emotional connection. This lays the foundation to help a child be better able to cope with stress and manage their emotions.

Attachment in parent-child relationships is very important for a child’s functioning throughout life.

# Attachment: A connection for life | Caring for kids

Attachment is the deep emotional bond between a baby and the person who provides most of their care. Just as most parents feel a strong connection with their newborn after birth, babies also become attached to their parents. Attachment takes place throughout a child’s development, but this document focuses on babies.

Attachment develops as you respond to your baby’s needs in warm, sensitive and consistent ways. This is especially important when your baby is sick, upset or distressed. Attachment also builds as you go about your daily routines with your baby, caring for them and interacting with them.

A baby’s first attachment usually happens quite naturally. Your baby cries, and you try to give them what they need: a feeding, a cuddle, or a diaper change. When you respond, your baby learns that they can trust you, and depend on you for comfort and to feel safe. As you get better at knowing what your baby is telling you and meeting their needs, your baby feels less stress.

Responding quickly to a baby’s cries is the best way to show them that they are safe and loved. It should not be confused with “spoiling”. Babies cannot be spoiled. When they’re sick, upset or distressed, they need to know that you are there for them.

Attachment involves 2 people interacting, sharing, and connecting. As you respond to your baby’s needs, your baby will respond to you. You’ll notice that it becomes easier to soothe them, that they want to be near you, and that they react to you even from a distance. Holding, rocking or talking softly to your baby all promote attachment.

While a baby’s first attachment is often with their mother, the bonds that babies form with their fathers are just as important. Though babies form attachment relationships with other adults who care for them, the bonds with their parents are the most important ones.

Secure or healthy attachment is the foundation that lets your child explore the world and have a safe place to come back to. Attachment is the first way that babies learn to organize their feelings and their actions, by looking to the person who provides them with care and comfort. Attachment is essential to long-term emotional health.

Healthy attachment will help your child handle situations as they grow older, such as separating from you (starting child care or school), cooperating with other children, and developing self-control. Attachment also helps your child learn how to trust other people, so it’s an important part of developing healthy relationships later in life.

The early signs that a secure attachment is forming are some of a parent’s greatest rewards:

If your baby doesn’t respond to you, show interest in people or make eye contact, make an appointment with a health care provider.

Babies can develop secure attachment with more than one important adult in their lives, including a child care provider. This doesn’t affect the special relationship babies have with their parents or primary caregiver.

“My baby won’t stop crying!”

There are times when even the most caring parent can’t soothe a baby’s cries. Remember that in the first 3 months, all babies go through a period when they cry more than at any other time. Keep responding to your baby in a warm and sensitive way. But if the crying becomes too much, and nothing you do helps, it’s OK to walk away for a moment. Just be sure your baby is safe in their crib, or with another caring adult. If you are worried or stressed by your baby’s crying, ask for help.

“Our family is going through some rough times.”

Sometimes there are other problems that make it hard for parents to care for their baby. Illness in a family—whether it’s the mother herself, a sibling, or another family member—can make it difficult to care for a new baby. Being separated for long periods of time can also cause stress. 

“I can’t tell what my baby needs.”

Sometimes babies have issues that make attachment difficult. Some babies have trouble making their needs understood. They may have health problems, be irritable, or hard to read. If this is the case, speak to your doctor about what you can do.

“I think I may be depressed.”

Mothers who are depressed may have trouble being loving and caring all the time. If depression is not treated, it can affect how attachment develops. Babies who don’t develop a healthy attachment may have behavioural or developmental problems later in childhood. If you think you are depressed, or feel that you cannot take care of your baby, it’s important to tell someone. If you’re the partner of a mother who seems depressed, or is having trouble taking care of her baby, it’s also important to reach out. Talk to your doctor, nurse, midwife, or contact your local public health office for a listing of services in your area.

The 5 conditions for secure attachment


 


Published on July 2, 2020
Updated on April 14, 2024 

The avoidant attachment style (referred to as anxious-avoidant in childhood) is one of the three insecure adult attachment styles identified in psychological literature.

Caregivers (usually parents) who are strict and emotionally distant, do not tolerate expressions of feelings, and expect their child to be independent and tough might raise children with an avoidant attachment style.

Avoidant attachment in adults may, from the outside, look like self-confidence and self-sufficiency. This is because the avoidant attachment style causes a low tolerance for emotional or physical intimacy and, sometimes, struggles with building long-lasting relationships. Furthermore, in the workplace, adults with avoidant attachment are often seen as the independent, “lone wolf” type. However, due to their self-sufficiency, they may also be high achievers.

It is, however, possible to heal from the avoidant attachment style. With increased understanding, the correct strategies, and therapy when needed, adults with the avoidant attachment style can form healthier outlooks and behaviors, and develop a more secure attachment style.

In this article, we will cover the most common questions around avoidant attachment:

Have you ever wondered why some people do not want to depend on or truly connect with anyone, even when in a relationship? Most of us aim to build strong relationships throughout our lives.

We are ‘hungry’ for love and affection. Why? Because emotional intimacy has many advantages. Namely, we are able to share our thoughts and feelings openly, we receive support and reassurance, we feel heard, appreciated, valued, and consequently, we feel calm and safe.

Emotional closeness can provide us with a feeling of stability – we are not going through life alone; we have someone to rely on. If we feel safe and valued by others, we are also able to maintain a higher self-esteem and a positive outlook on life.

If you are someone that needs to have close relationships and wants to rely on others (and have others rely on you), you have probably wondered why some people lack these basic human desires. How do they even make it work?

The truth is, this is most often not a conscious choice. The way we form relationships as adults has a lot to do with the way we formed our first social bonds as children with our caregivers.

Attachment theory is well-known and researched in the field of Psychology. Psychiatrist and psychoanalyst John Bowlby and his attachment theory shed light on and explain this phenomenon.

Attachment theory suggests that our early relationships with our caregivers (in childhood) set the stage for how we build relationships in the future (in adulthood).

The behavior of our caregivers is the first example of social interactions that we are presented with. It thus becomes informative of how relationships work.

Are other people going to take care of me? Can I trust them? Can I rely on them?

When raising a baby in a secure environment, where the caregivers are emotionally available and responsive to the baby’s needs, the answers to these (subconscious) questions will probably be yes. This is what we call a secure attachment.

However, when the child perceives that their basic and emotional needs are not met, they will have a hard time trusting people. Social bonds might be perceived by such children as not safe or stable. This is how a child forms an insecure attachment.

Let’s get back to that person you know, who is self-sufficient and does not (want to) rely on others. Based on attachment theory, we would categorize his or her attachment style as an insecure attachment style. It is known, more specifically, as avoidant/dismissive.

The development of an anxious-avoidant attachment style in a child has much to do with the emotional availability of their caregivers. The caregivers do not necessarily neglect the child in general; they are present.

Nevertheless, they tend to avoid the display of emotion and intimacy and are often misattuned to the child’s emotional needs. Such caregivers are reserved and seem to back off when the child reaches out for support, reassurance and affection.

The caregivers are likely to become more distant as the situation gets more emotionally dense. They might become overwhelmed and want to get out. This is when their unavailability would be most evident.

The child expresses a need for closeness, but instead of receiving it, they perceive that the door is shut in their face. Parents whose children become avoidant might not only avoid expressing their own feelings.

They might also disapprove of and not tolerate any notable display of emotions from their children, regardless of whether it is negative (sadness / fear) or positive (excitement / joy).

When such display of emotions occurs, caregivers can become angry and try to disrupt the child’s behavior by telling the child to toughen up. The parent expects the young child to behave independent, serious, and reserved.

Being raised in such an environment is likely to cause an avoidant attachment style. Most often, the caregivers have this attachment style themselves. Since the parent was raised that way, they pass it on, unintentionally, to the next generation.

Adults with the dismissive / avoidant attachment style seem to be pretty happy about who they are and where they are.

They might be very social, easy-going, and fun to be around. In addition, these individuals might have a lot of friends and/or sexual partners. Generally speaking, they are not alone or lonely.

Avoidant adults tend to be independent. Their self-esteem is high and they do not rely on others for reassurance or emotional support.

Such individuals might invest in their professional development and are likely to build up their confidence on each personal success. They seem to be in control.

For avoidant adults, social interactions and bonds remain on the surface. In order for a relationship to be meaningful and fulfilling, it has to become deep. That’s when you would ‘hit a wall’ when dealing with avoidant attachment style and relationships.

These individuals will let you be around them, but will not let you in. They tend to avoid strong displays of closeness and intimacy. As soon as things get serious, dismissive/avoidant individuals are likely to close themselves off.

At this point, such people might try to find a reason to end a relationship. They might be highly annoyed by their partner’s behavior, habit, or even physical appearance. Consequently, they start drifting off and distancing themselves from the partner. Adults with this attachment style believe that they do not need emotional intimacy in their lives.

This is a direct result of their upbringing. Their caregivers showed them that people cannot be relied on. Whenever they sought emotional support in the past, it was not provided. They simply stop seeking or expecting it from others. It’s as if they have ‘turned off the switch’.

From the outside, an adult with an avoidant attachment style might look confident, strong, and together. This does not mean, however, that this person is not suffering or making those around him/her suffer.

To the avoidant adult, emotional closeness and intimacy are often off the table. Not because they will not reap benefits, but because they do not know how.

Either way, not being able to build a deep, meaningful, and long-lasting relationship can be painful for people with this attachment style. It can also be heart-breaking for the ones who love them.

Furthermore, having an avoidant attachment style as a parent is likely to affect your child’s attachment style. If you have it, you will probably pass it on.

If you recognize the dismissive/avoidant attachment style in yourself or you realize you are dating someone with avoidant attachment style, what can you do?

The key is to admit and realize that the ‘switch’ on emotional intimacy has to be turned on. This might be challenging and require a lot of effort.

What do I feel? The avoidant adult needs to start paying attention to the emotional and physical sensations that come up around (emotional) intimacy. Self-reflection might help one make sense of and analyze existing patterns.

What do I need? Another essential step is exploring, understanding, and eventually expressing emotional needs.

What should I do? At some point, the avoidant adult might be able to start working on building closer relationships with people. They could follow a step-by-step approach to letting others in and responding to the emotional needs of close ones.

Obviously, working with a therapist on this pattern would potentially be the most beneficial way to move forward with earning secure attachment. If that’s not an option for you, we have online courses for you to move forward.

Either way, if you want to change your attachment style, you need to put effort in it. Whether you are working through it with a close friend, a therapist, or a book, consistency and effort are fundamental.

If you prefer to go the route of a workbook, we recently released our first series of attachment style digital workbooks.

If you feel distant and disconnected in your relationships and often withdraw from contact, this workbook might just be the step you need to take to begin your journey to positive change.

Our avoidant attachment style digital workbook includes:

We are frequently asked some recurring questions about the avoidant attachment style. We’re going to go through some of these to better help you understand the phenomenon of avoidant attachment. 

The answer to this question isn’t necessarily simple: We’re all unique with individual needs. Having said as much, the roots of an avoidant attachment style are in a childhood of perceived rejection. Therefore, if you or someone you love has an avoidant attachment, then you may have shut your attachment system down. This means that you may withdraw from emotional closeness and intimacy because you’ve convinced yourself that you don’t need it. However, we all need love–and the only way to heal is to open yourself up to opportunities for it.

The best way of healing is to process your issues around relationships with a mental health professional. Yet, if this isn’t an option for you, there are other ways of becoming more self-aware and open. For example, dedicated workbooks and strategies that target avoidant attachment in a phased, gentle manner can be of great assistance.

The answer to this question is, yes. Of course, it is possible to date with an avoidant attachment style. However, how to date with an avoidant attachment style may look quite different to those with a secure, anxious, or disorganized style. 

You may need to recognize your boundaries and how you enact them–after all, even though you may be uncomfortable with emotions, the likelihood is that the person you’re dating will require you to open up from time to time. 

Again, self-work can make dating with an avoidant attachment style an easier process, and this is best done with a therapist. Yet, you can still make big strides through more self-directed strategies such as workbooks and courses dedicated to the avoidant attachment style.

The question of whether men with an avoidant attachment style feel love is a common one, yet it also perpetuates a myth about people with an avoidant attachment style in general. For one thing, both men and women develop the avoidant attachment style, even though it is predominantly associated with men.

Another point is that, of course, avoidant attachment men feel love. The difference is that they struggle to both show and accept it. Remember, their early attempts for affection were likely rejected, so they internalized the message that people will reject their attempts and brought this message into their adult lives.

If you’re wondering how to deal with avoidant attachment in relationships, the answer will depend on whether you’re the one with the avoidant attachment style, or if you’re dating someone with it. 

If you’re the one with avoidant attachment, make sure you check out our guide Avoidant Attachment in Relationships for assistance. And remember, if it’s an issue you can’t solve by yourself, a trained couples therapist may be able to help.

The avoidant attachment style is one of the three insecure attachment styles. Avoidant attachment is characterized by withdrawal from emotional closeness, denial of emotions, independence, and self-sufficiency. 

It’s important to understand that although adults with the avoidant attachment style may act as though they don’t need love, the opposite is true–they need love just as much as everyone else. However, their early years didn’t equip them with the ability to show and receive affection and emotional closeness. 

It’s clear that the avoidant attachment style can be difficult both for those with it and for the people who love someone with avoidant attachment. Yet, attachment styles are not a life sentence: If you have an avoidant attachment style, it is always possible to heal and grow. Tuning into your emotions, the needs of others, and further understanding your attachment style is an excellent place to start.

Remember, if you want to achieve a more secure attachment style, therapy with a trained mental health professional is the best situation in which to do so. In a relationship with a therapist, someone with an avoidant attachment can learn how to trust in others, become more aware of their own emotions, and open up more in relationships.

On This Page:

Avoidant attachment style refers to a psychological and emotional pattern characterized by an individual’s tendency to avoid emotional closeness and dismiss the importance of intimate relationships, often as a self-protective measure.

Avoidant individuals tend to have a negative view of others and a mostly positive view of themselves. They believe other people are untrustworthy and dishonest, whereas they themselves are confident and capable and do not need the support of anyone else. 

Individuals with an avoidant attachment style often have difficulty forming and maintaining deep emotional connections with others. They may feel uncomfortable with intimacy, fear dependence on others, and strongly desire independence and self-reliance.

This attachment style usually develops as a result of emotional rejection and neglect from primary caregivers in early childhood.

For these individuals, avoidance and withdrawal become their strategy to protect themselves from experiencing more pain and abandonment.

There are several common characteristics of adults with an avoidant attachment style. These characteristics include: valuing independence over emotional closeness, suppressing or downplaying emotions, distrusting others, relying on themself for emotional support, and struggling to share their thoughts and feelings with others. 

While outwardly these individuals often come across as confident, fun-loving, social, and easy-going, they tend to have acquaintances and sexual partners rather than close friendships and committed relationships.

People with this attachment style may not openly or consciously experience distress or the need for comfort, but their attachment insecurity is a sign of low self-worth. These individuals often display symptoms of poor mental health, such as depression and anxiety.

Here is a personal account of someone with an avoidant attachment style:

“I have known I’m a dismissive avoidant for some time now and the main thing I really want to stress is that this avoidance is almost entirely subconscious on our part unless someone brings our attention to it.  

I had no idea I was doing this for years and years and the result was that I truly hurt a lot of people. In college, I started having unexplained physical symptoms (stomach ache, vision changes, heart palpitations, chest pain) which were later determined to be anxiety and depression after the doctors ruled literally everything else out […] 

I would be dating a guy who I initially really liked, but as the relationship wore on I would decide they were not good enough due to some fatal flaw and they couldn’t possibly be “the one.” This decision always happens to coincide with these men wanting more commitment.  

I loved casually dating, but the second someone wanted to make things official or get emotionally closer, I would suddenly end it, much to their surprise […] 

Interestingly, I would become deeply lonely and sad during single periods but would continue the same process or pull away as soon as I started to get close to someone.  

Following that I’d become lonely and sad again. I thought my problem was that “the one” was not out there […]”

Avoidant individuals tend to feel overwhelmed and uncomfortable when another person wants to be emotionally vulnerable and physically intimate.

This is because they have learned that depending on others, wanting to be close, and looking for support will be met with rejection. For them, it is easier to suppress these needs altogether and avoid deep emotions and intimacy.

Certain relational scenarios trigger an avoidant individual’s maladaptive beliefs and behaviors.

Some examples include:

Avoidantly attached individuals deal with these situations by pulling away, breaking up with their partner, or physically and emotionally distancing themselves from friends and family.

These are called “deactivating strategies” and serve the function of sustaining a comfortable space between themselves and other people. 

In essence, they are strategies for protecting themselves from re-experiencing the pain and disappointment they experienced early in life.

However, these behaviors are damaging to the health and stability of relationships and can confuse and upset their loved ones. They also prevent avoidant individuals from experiencing the benefits of intimacy and the joys of sharing deep bonds with other people.

That is why healing an avoidant attachment style is worthwhile and rewarding.

Healing an avoidant attachment style involves self-reflection, self-awareness, and actively working on developing healthier patterns of relating to others. This may demand time, effort, and help, but change is possible.

First, you must educate yourself about attachment theory and gain a deeper understanding of avoidant attachment. Understanding your attachment style and addressing your avoidant tendencies can help you towards a more satisfying, interconnected, and well-deserved life.

You must also explore any early childhood experiences or significant relationships that may have contributed to the development of your avoidant attachment style.

It is also important to learn to identify and express your emotions. Healing is not merely about changing behavior, as this often triggers compensatory behavior. 

Rather, healing lies in transforming your unconscious beliefs and assumptions underpinning your avoidant attachment behavior. Examine and challenge any negative beliefs or expectations you hold about relationships, intimacy, and vulnerability and replace them with more realistic and positive beliefs that promote healthy connections.

Avoidantly attached individuals unconsciously fear that their emotional needs will lead to rejection. To heal, these expectations must be contested through new experiences that correct past childhood experiences. This may involve sharing your fears, desires, and insecurities with trusted individuals. Practice being present and open to emotional intimacy.

These experiences can gradually shape a new internal model of relationships. There are various methods to facilitate this belief alteration.

Although they may not be aware of it, avoidantly attached people often suffer from low self-esteem and mental health challenges. This is likely because they suppress their feelings and emotions rather than allowing others to provide emotional support. 

It is important to learn how to become more comfortable with asking for support and fostering relationships where you feel safe and valued.

Self-regulation strategies are good ways to manage difficult emotions, such as the overwhelming urge to run away when others want to get close.

These strategies are about learning to sit with your emotions by becoming conscious of their existence, observing them, and then challenging them with compassion.

Learning to manage attachment insecurities is a process that takes time and patience, but the end result is worthwhile. 

Here is some advice to get you started:

Healthy communication is fundamental to overcoming avoidant attachment. By creating a channel for yourself and others to effectively convey emotions and needs, you will foster profound, meaningful connections.

The development of active listening skills and assertiveness plays an integral part in this process. Active listening involves engaging in conversations and accurately interpreting the speaker’s sentiments, establishing trust and emotional connection.

Assertiveness, on the other hand, pertains to the direct and clear articulation of emotions and needs while respecting others’ feelings and boundaries. This is a delicate balancing act that prevents avoidance of difficult discussions and promotes emotional intimacy and respect.

Empathic communication and boundary-setting form the second pillar of healthy communication. Empathy requires understanding and validating others’ emotions while comfortably expressing your own, thus creating a nurturing environment for emotional intimacy. 

Avoiding emotional intimacy is not setting a boundary. Setting boundaries, while complex when the limits aren’t clearly defined, involves establishing what one is willing to accept in a relationship and respecting others’ boundaries. This ensures emotional safety and trust in the relationship.

Lastly, the practice of conflict resolution is crucial. It involves handling disagreements respectfully and effectively, validating each other’s emotions and needs, and collaboratively problem-solving. 

Although open communication can be challenging due to the need for emotional control and teamwork, it will help prevent emotional disconnection and promote intimacy and connection.

At the heart of it, individuals with avoidant attachment tend to fear revealing intense emotions or appearing in disarray. Hence, having open, transparent conversations in a relationship is the cornerstone of effective emotion regulation. 

Both parties should strive for lucid communication to voice concerns without fear of judgment. Gradually, adults with an avoidant attachment will come to understand that discussing their emotions is healthier than suppressing them.

Be specific and clear: Make your needs and desires known clearly and in detail to prevent misunderstandings. Utilize specific wording and steer clear of vague or unclear statements. 

This will aid your loved ones in fully comprehending what you are asking for.

Employ “I” statements: When expressing your needs and wishes, use “I” statements as they help to evade an accusatory or confrontational tone. 

Instead of saying, “You never assist with the housework,” you could say, “I feel overwhelmed when I’m left to do all the housework, and I would appreciate some assistance.”

Welcome feedback: While articulating your needs and wishes, be receptive to feedback and be ready to participate in constructive discussions. 

This encourages you and your loved ones to discover solutions that are satisfactory to all parties involved.

Embrace openness and vulnerability: Start gently letting your guard down and becoming more open and vulnerable with others by disclosing your thoughts, emotions, and experiences. 

This will aid in forging trust, emotional bonding, and a secure environment for emotional expression. Focus on cultivating trust with your loved ones by demonstrating honesty, transparency, and dependability. 

Establishing trust will generate a comfortable environment for you and your loved ones to articulate your needs and wants without hesitation.

Cultivating trust and vulnerability can be transformative. It is best to practice this with a securely attached partner in an environment that allows for safe vulnerability. Despite initial discomfort, repeated positive responses will lessen unease.

Therapy can be a valuable alternative. Specifically, a therapist trained in emotion-focused therapy can assist in expressing emotions effectively.

Because of your expectations of other people and relationships formed in your younger years, your patterns of thought, feeling, and behavior are mostly automatic and subconscious.

That means you may not be aware of why you think, feel, and behave the way you do. In order to create change, you must first become aware of what is happening within you when it comes to relationships.

If you have established that you have an avoidant attachment style, pay close attention to situations that make you feel uncomfortable and provoke a need to shut down or run away.

What thoughts go through your mind? How does your body feel? What is your mind telling you to do?

When you are mindful of these situations and how you are feeling, it’s much easier to intervene. Ask yourself: Am I pushing someone away because I’m scared of getting close? Am I not asking for support because I fear they will reject me?

Take time and observe what is happening in your mind and body before reacting automatically. It can be helpful to write these thoughts down in a journal to process your emotions, set goals, and track your progress.

When your need to avoid is triggered, it means your nervous system and the fight/flight/freeze response has been activated. When this happens, you go into a trance state where your reactions become subconscious.

Practicing mindfulness and becoming conscious of what’s happening within us is easier when you learn how to regulate your nervous system and automatic reactions.

You can do this by practicing grounding techniques, such as breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfully connecting with nature.

The more you practice these, the more control you will gain over your mind and body. That means, you should practice grounding regularly, both when you are and when you are not experiencing the need to avoid.

Your attachment style stems from early childhood experiences, which may account for their unconscious nature. 

Delving into these memories can help you pinpoint the origin of your unconscious thoughts. Gaining awareness and articulation of these beliefs enables their transformation.

Therapy can be instrumental here. A competent therapist can unearth and process the foundation of your attachment style, assisting you in fostering a secure and fulfilling relational pattern.

A technique that helps to heal the wounds of the past is to mentally revisit your childhood and engage with your child-self with understanding and kindness. 

For whatever reason, your caregivers, friends, and/ or partners were unable to meet your needs adequately and may have behaved in damaging ways toward you.

Tell your child-self that it was not their fault; they did whatever they could to survive and what they experienced was painful and undeserved.

Have compassion for yourself and acknowledge that it’s okay to feel sad or angry about the way you may have been treated.

Once you have acknowledged this, it’s easier to let go of the fear of rejection, learn how to be intimate, and ask for help. The past does not have to control the present and future.

Although you can do a lot of this work on your own, it is often helpful to have a therapist who can help you through this process. It’s also an opportunity to practice asking someone for help.

A therapist can discuss attachment theory with you and help you to identify and challenge your avoidant beliefs and behaviors. 

They can also be a (temporary) secure attachment figure for you and demonstrate what a trusting and reliable relationship looks and feels like.

Once you have established a practice of self-regulation strategies, you can do some behavioral experiments in the form of practicing secure behaviors. 

The best way to change beliefs and thought patterns is to have evidence for your ability to behave and feel more secure.

To maximize their chances of survival, infants are born with an innate attachment drive. When they are frightened or distressed, their attachment system is activated, which leads to proximity-seeking behaviors towards caregivers (e.g., crying, clinging). Once they have achieved proximity and safety, their attachment system is deactivated.

Thus, the primary caregiver’s responsiveness and availability during infancy and early childhood play a crucial role in shaping a child’s attachment style.

Children who experience stable, safe, and sensitive caregiving tend to develop a secure attachment style – they expect to be safe and protected and can confidently explore the world.

Children whose caregivers did not respond sensitively and responsively to their needs and signs of distress often develop an insecure attachment style.

If the child’s bids for closeness, comfort, and safety were rejected and their emotional expression was punished or shamed, they may develop an avoidant attachment style.

Children with an avoidant attachment may have experienced a lack of emotional or physical responsiveness from their caregivers. When they sought comfort or connection, their needs may have been consistently dismissed or ignored, leading them to believe that reaching out for closeness is futile or even met with rejection.

This leads a child to learn that it is best to suppress or minimize their needs and emotions to avoid disappointment or rejection.

These children tend to develop a highly independent personality, learning to rely on themselves for emotional support and soothing. They tend to become self-reliant and develop a strong desire for autonomy.

It’s important to note that attachment styles are not solely determined by early childhood experiences. Genetics, innate personality traits, and life experiences can also interact with the caregiving environment to create an attachment style.

Furthermore, attachment styles are not necessarily stable over time, and relationships later in life can also significantly impact shaping attachment styles. 

For example, individuals who have healthy and high-quality friendships during their teenage years are more likely to be securely attached in adulthood.

There are several common characteristics of children with an avoidant attachment style. These characteristics include: avoidance of physical closeness, independence and self-reliance, minimal seeking of comfort, emotional suppression, limited eye-contact, and difficulty with trust. Children with this attachment style are also highly sensitive 

According to psychiatrist Dan Siegel, “[children] intuitively pick up the feeling that their parents have no intention of getting to know them, which leaves them with a deep sense of emptiness.” 

They resist and avoid close contact with their caregivers to please them and prevent further rejection. This behavior and the sense of emptiness can make them seem aloof, unemotional, and precociously autonomous.

While these signs indicate that a child leans more towards an avoidant attachment style, they are not enough to classify a child as avoidant. 

These signs have to be viewed in context. For example, if they see their best friend and are not sad to say goodbye, that does not necessarily mean they are avoidant; they may just be distracted.

# What Is an Avoidant Attachment Style? - Wondermind

Sometimes in life, you learn the name for a phenomenon you’ve long experienced but never knew was a thing. That’s what happened when I discovered that A) all people have their own specific styles of behavior in relationships and B) those behavioral patterns can manifest in some pretty fascinating ways—like an avoidant attachment style. 

Without getting into my relationship history (platonic or romantic), I’ve definitely noticed a pattern of emotional distance on my part. And that distance would be justified because people are generally terrible and can’t be trusted… right? Right??



Δ

Turns out, people who tend to resist or downplay their need for affection could have an avoidant attachment style. And that relationship pattern could keep them closed off from having meaningful relationships, explains therapist John Taylor, PhD, LPC, an assistant professor in the urban public health and nutrition department at LaSalle University in Philadelphia. 

Below, you’ll learn more about avoidant attachment, who it happens to, and how to deal if it’s becoming an issue.

For those not knee-deep in TikTok therapists’ content and mental health memes, here’s the gist of attachment theory: It dates back to the 1980s when psychologist John Bowlby studied how infants responded to their parents leaving them alone. The idea is that the way we were taken care of (or not) by our caregivers can impact how we approach our adult relationships—romantic or otherwise.

In theory, if the people who raised you were reliably on top of your physical and emotional needs, you’d develop a secure attachment, where you believe you’re worthy of love and attention and that other people will probably accept and respond to you, according to the American Psychological Association (APA). 

If that wasn’t quite your experience (to put it nicely), you could form an insecure attachment or the type of attachment styles that are a lot less helpful in life, like anxious attachment and, of course, avoidant attachment. 

With that last one, it’s often the case that the parent or caretaker didn’t show enough affection or responsiveness to the child’s needs, leading them to struggle with their emotions on their own. “During their childhood, they developed an attachment with a parent or caretaker who didn't express warmth or love (emotional and/or physical),” says sex therapist Jessica Sanchez, LMSW, an assistant professor of clinical practice at the University of Texas at Arlington. “Overall, [their caretaker didn’t create] a nurturing environment beyond providing the basic essentials, like housing and food,” adds Sanchez.

Essentially, someone with an avoidant attachment style may have learned early on that their needs or concerns weren’t important—no one’s coming to save them, explains Sanchez.

The reason this is called “avoidant” attachment is because people with this attachment style feel it’s safest to detach from others when they’re upset or stressed, says therapist Sefora Ray, LMFT. And, even if they’re not feeling tough emotions, they might feel overwhelmed or threatened when people try to get closer to them, she adds. Sometimes that means ~avoiding~ emotional connection without realizing it. 

I must admit, when I started learning more about avoidant attachment, I was feeling rudely called out. Avoidant to the point of rejecting emotional closeness? Sure. Doing so in the name of self-protection and/or self-preservation? Yes. Thinking avoidance and withdrawal can somehow shield you from experiencing more pain and abandonment? Mm hm. It all sounds way too familiar.

While everyone’s avoidant attachment style manifests differently (no two childhoods are exactly alike, after all), one way to tell if someone is avoidant is by assessing how they respond to stress: Do they prefer to ride it out solo or seek support from others?

When people with avoidant attachment feel upset, sad, or just off, they often turn to dissociative activities to distract themselves, like work, exercise, video games, or social media, says Ray. Along the same lines, they might appear very chill when they’re experiencing seriously high levels of stress. “They tend to have difficulty staying with their feelings or even knowing what they are feeling at all,” she adds.

When other people are upset around them, someone who has an avoidant attachment style might struggle to comfort the other person or even withdraw from the situation in order to feel better, Ray explains.

“These individuals are often reluctant to ask for help, uncomfortable sharing their feelings, and usually expect their partners and friends to ‘just know what they are feeling,’” Dr. Taylor says. “In my work, I often find people with an avoidant attachment style spend a lot of time in their heads, thinking and feeling undervalued.”

Other signs someone has an avoidant attachment style: They’re reluctant to say “I love you,” they focus on small imperfections, they judge people who depend on others (or just the idea of it), and they might resist physical touch, Sanchez says. One recent study also suggests that those with an avoidant attachment style had a harder time processing facial expressions compared to people with a secure attachment style. So there’s that.

While it’s tempting to self-diagnose (thanks, internet!!), getting a professional’s opinion is still the best way to assess your attachment style and figure out what to do about it. Personally, therapy has helped me recognize patterns and be more thoughtful about how I approach emotionally tense situations. The more you know, right?

If Team Avoidant is sounding not great, know that we’re still absolutely worthy and deserving of love. “One of the most common myths I hear from individuals with avoidant attachment style is that they feel like they’re hard to love,” Sanchez says. “Then, of course, I have to gently challenge that person’s view on what it means to love and to accept love.”

Dr. Taylor often recommends that his clients use writing to identify their feelings, express them, and heal from the situations that might’ve contributed to their insecure attachment style in the first place. By journaling about the things you’re feeling (maybe instead of distracting yourself from those feels), you can pinpoint what triggered them and maybe see how valuable your emotions are, he adds. 

Another exercise that he finds especially helpful is writing a letter to your younger self about your life today. That provides an “opportunity to express all the things that happened when you were a child and attach a feeling to the experience,” explains Dr. Taylor.

Getting familiar with where you feel emotions in your body can also be helpful, says Sanchez. You can do that with an exercise called body scanning, in which you relax each part of your body starting with your head and working your way down, she explains. As you work through that process, you can identify where you feel things in relation to a certain situation or trigger. 

As you become more in tune with your body, your ability to react to a situation in a more helpful way or advocate for yourself can improve, explains Sanchez. “That’s the ultimate goal.”

The people in your life can also help you develop a more secure attachment style. When you spend time with a friend or partner who makes you feel safe enough to open up and is patient when you’re less willing to do the same, you can start to develop healthier ideas of trust, acceptance, love, and self-love, Sanchez says. 

“Our attachment styles are not fixed, and with the right amount of prioritization, we can all become more secure,” Ray says.

# A grandmother’s take on Attachment Parenting – APtly Said

APtly Said

Parenting with Attachment in Mind

By Donna Wetterlund

Like every grandparent, the arrival of my first grandchild was a rite of passage with mixed emotions. I was in denial about the label that clearly identified me as “old,” but I was fascinated with my daughter’s changing body and the life growing inside it.

I was proud of my daughter’s healthy and well-adjusted approach to pregnancy. But most importantly, I was celebrating the addition of a baby in my world without the morning sickness, stretch marks and sleepless nights. I was excited!

When pregnant, my daughter Sharon and her husband traveled to attend a wedding and asked me to dog-sit at their house while they were away. I was so excited to take care of this little puppy and I seized the opportunity to be involved in my granddaughter’s life before she was even born by kick-starting the renovation of the baby’s room. I spent two days tearing out paneling with my bare hands. I scraped and patched and primed the walls. It was a physical labor of love.

Sharon and Jim took over from there and created a darling room with murals of woodland creatures. My sweet baby granddaughter was going to have a spectacular room complete with a birdie mobile over the crib.

I was extremely impressed with Sharon and Jim’s commitment to natural childbirth and equally impressed with the hospital staff that supported her throughout the delivery. The hospital room was akin to a small apartment, which housed her birthing support team of two grandmothers and her spouse.

I literally pulled up a chair in between her legs to witness the birth of my granddaughter up close and personal. Witnessing a baby being born is amazing, and when it is your daughter giving birth to your granddaughter, well…I still burst into tears of joy thinking about it now.

I had spent eight months adjusting to the idea of being a grandmom. This adjustment included happy visions of babysitting and childcare, bonding with the baby while bottle feeding and taking the baby out in a stroller to visit friends and show off what my daughter had made. After all, I’ll have a new baby, too…a new mind to mold, a new person to be proud of, to share love with and have fun with.

Motherhood came so easily and naturally to Sharon from the second our baby was born. She was a breastfeeding champ. She followed her instincts. She could not fathom the thought of letting her baby sleep in the quiet and adorable empty room down the hall, so they slept together.

Her breast pump lay idle as mother and child nursed with ease and on demand. The stroller became a convenient place to hang winter jackets as the baby was worn in a wrap close to her mother’s beating heart. My daughter soon discovered that her instinctive parenting style had a name: Attachment Parenting.

I was struggling. 

My access to the baby was already diminished by the one-hour commute that made visiting difficult. Without the ability to produce my own milk, I was out of luck when it came to bonding by meeting the baby’s nutritional needs. The idea of spending more than an hour away from her infant appeared to throw Sharon’s hormone-soaked body into a quivering, milk-leaking frenzy. She decided not to return to work so that she could spend her time focused on the most important thing: her baby.

I questioned whether her decisions were a response to feeling that I had been a poor mother: balancing my career while exposing her to a diversity of caregivers and experiences. I thought I was doing it right, but was I all wrong?

I have not been called to babysit. There have been no sleepovers or walks in the stroller. Thank goodness for Facebook — if not for that, none of my friends would “see” the baby.

Dreams shattered? Not exactly…

I have done my own research and reading. But more importantly, what I witness when I visit my daughter’s family is a calm, happy home. Our baby is content and thriving. She is intelligent and vocal. She is healthy and beautiful. Mom and Dad have created a loving environment where a child will grow to be confident and strong.

It has taken another eight months to adjust my expectations for grandmotherhood. 

I don’t babysit. I baby-Skype, reading books to her through technology, making my face and voice a regular part of her life.

I don’t push a stroller. I walk beside my daughter wrapped with her baby.

My friends have not yet complained about the multitude of pictures and videos I post on social media.

And now that she is a bit older, my granddaughter smiles with satisfaction when I slip her a taste of my dessert at the restaurant.

what a wonderful grandma! Way too many grandmas out there who show no respect. They come from an era where CIO/rice cereal in the bottle from 3mos/etc was ok…yet BWing/EBF/BLW/cosleeping is wrong and BS to them.

This post found it’s way to me at just the right time. Attachment parenting can be difficult for grandparent to grasp and I hadn’t appreciated this. I love the fact that this grandmother found other ways to bond with her granddaughter. Discussing the parenting style with my in-laws an how they can get involved and foster a great relationship is next on our agenda.

MrsB

You sound like a new mothers nightmare.  The baby is not “our” baby, shes Sharon’s baby and pulling up a chair between her legs.   Your entitlement and words bother me.

Where to start. Did your daughter give you permission to start her nursery? Did she invite you to the birth, or did you insist? What right did you have to see the child before her own mum and dad? You sat between her legs?! You thought about or wished for your ability to breastfeed your grandchild. You had very unrealistic expectations about visits, Grammy time and sleepovers. You sneak your granddaughter dessert, presumably against her parents’ wishes. And the epitome of crazy:  you say “our baby” and claim part ownership of a CHILD. News flash. She is not YOURS. She is not even partially yours by reason of having birthed her mother. You need to back off, grandma.

Good on this grandma for finding a way to manage her expectations, but she seems to be the one trying to attachment parent her adult daughter. New roles are difficult but grandparents are not co-parents and should not feel entitled to bond as actual parents.

Good for you Donna. I know you are a wonderful grandmother. It gets better all the time. Enjoy every minute it goes so fast. We have a new great grandson. He is delightful,he has a brother and sister and all are precious. Love, Miss Shirl

Please don’t “slip” your granddaughter food. And anyone who has expectations of someone else’s baby experience needs to seriously consider getting some therapy. Possibly a hobby.

Sublime. What a perfect grandmother, what a lucky granddaughter. I will certainly model you someday Rita. <3 <3

Peter K. Smith on an important and suprisingly underresrearched relationship.

18 November 2005

While a great deal is written about parents, relatively little is written about grandparents, and their relationships with grandchildren. Yet some three-quarters of adults will become grandparents, and the mean age of becoming a grandparent is currently about 54 years in Britain (Dench & Ogg, 2002). Thus, most people will be a grandparent for around a third of their lifespan. With falling fertility and the demographic ageing of Western industrialised societies, family networks are changing from broad/horizontal to narrow/vertical structures or 'beanpole families', in which grandparents arguably have an increasingly important role to play (Hagestad, 2000). And it's a role that should interest a wide variety of psychologists, particularly developmental, social, clinical and educational.

Nowadays, grandparents generally get a good press. That was not always the case. Clinical case studies from the 1930s to 1950s, such as 'The grandmother: A problem in child rearing' (1937) and 'Grandma made Johnny delinquent' (1943) (both published in the American Journal of Orthopsychiatry), berated the adverse influence of grandmothers who interfered in old-fashioned and didactic ways with the mother's childrearing. There is in fact some supportive evidence: Staples and Smith (1954) found grandmothers to have stricter and more authoritarian views than mothers. But child-rearing opinions were changing rapidly in the 1950s, and on interviewing older people in the UK, Townsend (1957) reported that 'the grandparents were notably lenient towards grandchildren'. This leniency and spoiling may have been a reaction against the perceived earlier stricter role of grandparents. As one grandparent put it, 'I used to slosh my children. But I don't like to see my grandchildren walloped.'

Since the 1970s, as developmental psychology moved to a lifespan perspective, there has been more systematic research on grandparenting, and this generally shows grandparents in a positive light (Smith & Drew, 2002). Today's grandparents will have had a much fuller education, far fewer live directly with the grandchild, and their role is commonly seen as helper rather than family disciplinarian.

Contemporary grandparents and grandchildren see each other moderately frequently. In the UK, the British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey of 1998 found that 30 per cent of grandparents reported seeing grandchildren several times a week; conversely, 32 per cent said they saw their grandchild less than once a month (Dench & Ogg, 2002). The relationship is usually (though not invariably) quite close and satisfying, rather than conflictual, and is seen as positive and important by both generations.
Just as mothers are more often the closer parent to children, many studies find that grandmothers are involved with their grandchildren more than grandfathers are. Also, grandparents through the mother's side are typically more involved than those through the father's side (Dench & Ogg, 2002).
Grandparents and grandchildren do all sorts of things together, such as taking part in family events, having treats, imparting family history, playing games, going on holidays, shopping, watching TV or videos, babysitting, giving emergency help, giving personal advice, joining in religious activity, and giving advice on school (Smith & Drew, 2002). The BSA survey found that trips to the park or playground tended to make way for indoor games or watching TV at around the age of six (Dench & Ogg, 2002). Tyszkowa (1991) reported conversations as being prominent in activities reported by Polish grandchildren: 'When we go fishing with Grandpa, we talk. We tell each other about ourselves'; '…with Grandma I can talk about my problems'. Because they are close but do not have a parental authority role, grandparents can act as confidants in situations where an older child might not wish to confide in a parent. Also, grandparents will often know more about family history, and national history; Tyszkowa found many grandchildren in Poland reported that grandparents had told them about episodes such as the Second World War.

Uhlenberg and Hammill (1998) found six factors predicted contact between grandparents and grandchild; geographic proximity was the strongest, followed by quality of parent–grandparent relationship. In Britain, the BSA survey found that 74 per cent of grandparents reported contact several times a week if they lived within 15 minutes of a grandchild, 37 per cent if they lived between 15 minutes and an hour away, and 0 per cent if they lived more than an hour away. However, 86 per cent of grandparents and grandchildren keep in regular phone contact (Age Concern, 1998), and 4 per cent via the internet or e-mail – percentages likely to be rapidly increasing.

Different grandchildren have different needs and personalities. Ferguson et al. (2004) found that although some grandparents reported a norm of treating all grandchildren equally, others had noticeably closer relationships with one or a few grandchildren; this might be because of age, personality, or circumstances: 'I suppose K, the eldest one, had the most special relationship because she had nanny and granddad to herself for a time…' (p.53).

Television and children's books often portray grandparents as aged, fussy, domesticated, and sedentary, probably with infirmities (Roald Dahl is a culprit in this respect), although this is beginning to change (Janelli & Sorge, 2001). The stereotype is out of step with demographic realities, as most grandchildren who read children's books will have grandparents in their forties to sixties. As Hagestad (1985) pointed out for TV commercials: 'Often, the grandmother presented on the screen should be a great-grandmother. The woman who has small, golden-haired grandchildren is not likely to have silver hair in a bun…She would more realistically be portrayed dressed in a jogging suit on her way to aerobic dancing, or in a suit coming home from work' (pp.35–36).

For most people, becoming a grandparent is a positive experience; but this can depend on the age at which it happens. Nearly one third of grandparents enter grandparenthood 'off-time': either before 40 or after 60 (Szinovacz, 1998). Burton and Bengtson (1985) interviewed African-American grandmothers and found that those women who became grandmothers early (25–37 years) were discontented, feeling obligations they were not ready for: 'I don't have time to do what I would like to do as a grandmother. I work everyday. I have young children. Right now I'm just too busy,' said one 31-year-old grandmother. They were also affected by the stereotypes associated with grandparenting and age: 'I am just too young to be a grandmother. That's something for old folks, not for me' (p.68). Those grandparents who experienced the transition 'late' (in their seventies) were often disappointed that they were not physically active enough to make the most of the grandparental role. Thus, off-time grandparents, whether early or late, are likely to experience more difficulties in the role. This is reflected in findings from the BSA survey. Grandparents aged 50–65 were more likely to find the role rewarding, and feel very close to their grandchild, than grandparents aged less than 50, or 66 and older (Dench & Ogg, 2002).

Influences can be direct, resulting from contact and face-to-face interaction, and indirect, mediated by other means such as parental behaviour. One source of indirect influence of grandparents is via financial support. Also, by acting as parents themselves, grandparents influence how their children act as parents. Benoit and Parker (1994) found 65 per cent concordance in attachment security across three generations: maternal grandmothers' and mothers' adult attachment interview (AAI) status and infants' strange situation classification at 12 months.    

Attachment theory emphasises consistency over generations, but it also predicts that adults can work through or resolve unsatisfactory relations with their parents and modify their internal working models, either through self-reflection or with the aid of therapy or counselling. Many survivors of the Holocaust in the Second World War (now grandparents) score unresolved on the AAI, due to the traumatic way in which they lost their parents at an early age; but few of their children score unresolved, and their grandchildren appear to be indistinguishable from the remaining population in terms of attachment characteristics (Sagi-Schwartz et al., 2003).

Other studies have looked at transmission of more general qualities such as warmth, autonomy, depression and aggression. For example Vermulst et al. (1991) noted overall differences between generations, in Dutch grandmother/mother dyads; mothers scored higher than grandmothers on educational level, affection, and perceived support, but lower on conformity and restriction. They found links from grandmother affection to mother's psychological well-being. About one third of the variation found in mother's parental functioning could be explained in terms of earlier parental functioning of the grandmother.

Research on children's antisocial behaviour also points to intergenerational influences. The use of physically aggressive and punitive techniques in the grandparent/parent generation predicts similar behaviour in the parent/grandchild generation, and also antisocial behaviour in the grandchildren (Farrington, 1993; Murphy-Cowan & Stringer, 1999). Caspi and Elder (1988) found a reinforcing dynamic between problem behaviour and unstable ties in the family across four generations of women in their Berkeley Guidance Study.

Examples of direct influence are giving gifts, being a companion and confidant, acting as an emotional support or 'buffer' at times of family stress, passing on family history or national traditions, and acting as a role model for ageing. Jessel et al. (2004) worked with families of Bangladeshi origin in the East End of London. They found examples of synergistic learning interactions between grandparents and grandchildren; the grandmother would help the grandchild learn about their Bengali language and heritage, while the grandchild would be helping their grandmother learn how to use computers.

Regular child care from grandparents can provide help for the middle generation. The BSA survey found that about one fifth of grandparents looked after grandchildren once a week or more; this was almost as common for children aged 5–12 (after-school or holiday care) as for pre-school children, and was more frequent when mothers were working part-time, than full-time (Dench & Ogg, 2002). Grandchild care can later lead to close grandparent/grandchild relationships.

Many grandparents enjoy looking after a grandchild, which can be an opportunity for indulging them. As one song puts it, Granny spoils us, oh what fun, Have some sweets and a sticky bun, Don't tell mum you were up till ten, I want to come and babysit again!

But some grandmothers, especially paternal grandmothers, may be reluctant to provide long-term support of child care for working mothers: 'One thing I've always said, even with my own daughter, I would never look after grandchildren on the same basis during the day whilst they go to work. I don't agree with that. I've brought up my own children and I don't want to be tied down every day looking after grandchildren' (Cotterill, 1992, p.614).

In parent-maintained households with co-resident grandparents there is much greater opportunity for helping with child care. Although this is more the norm in some traditional societies, Pearson et al. (1990) studied a predominantly African-American community in Chicago, and found that 10 per cent of households with six- to eight-year-old children had co-resident grandmothers. The grandmothers had substantial childrearing roles in these families, in control, support and punishment. Oyserman et al. (1993) examined families where teen mothers of children under two were assisted by grandparents. Involved grandfathers had a positive influence, probably by modelling a male role of nurturance and cooperation.

In grandparent-maintained households, the grandparents are actually responsible for their grandchildren (Clarke & Cairns, 2001; Richards, 2001). In many such cases there are family problems and poverty, and research (mainly in the US) finds that grandchildren reared in grandparent-headed households have poorer academic performance than similar children in parent-headed households, and that grandparents in grandparent-headed households have a higher incidence of depression and risk for physical and emotional health problems (Szinovacz et al., 1999). Some custodial grandparents need support at a national and community level to continue effectively; however, data from the 1997 US Census Bureau suggested that 36 per cent of custodial grandparents had excellent or very good health and worked outside the home.

Grandparents can experience unexpected difficulties if they wish to adopt grandchildren who lack parental care (Chesterman et al., 2005; Jenkins, 2001). However the most debated legal aspects relating to grandparents, concern access to grandchildren when parents divorce.

When parents separate and divorce, the relationship of grandparents to parents, particularly to a custodial parent (or one who has care and control of the grandchildren) becomes a crucial issue.
If these are harmonious, grandparents can provide stability, support and nurturance to the grandchild(ren) and family, often providing financial assistance or child care (Dench & Ogg, 2002; Ferguson et al., 2004). They can negotiate relationship difficulties between the parent and grandchild and be a 'buffer' during times of family distress. Lussier et al. (2002), using data from the ALSPAC longitudinal study, found that closeness to maternal (but not paternal) grandparents was significantly associated with grandchild adjustment when parents had separated, even when other family variables were controlled for.

In contrast, a difficult or disrupted grandparent–parent relationship can threaten proximity of grandparents to grandchildren, contact, involvement and fulfilment of a satisfying grandparental role (Ferguson et al., 2004; Lavers & Sonuga-Barke, 1997). If (as is usually the case) the children reside with their mother, then paternal grandparents may have to 'tread carefully' in obtaining access to their grandchildren; and it can be denied. The consequences of unwanted loss of contact with grandchildren can be devastating. Drew and Smith (2002) sampled grandparents who were members of support groups such as the Grandparents Association; after loss of contact with their grandchildren due to parental divorce, grandparents reported symptoms of bereavement and negative effects on their physical and emotional health (more so than with separation just arising from geographical distance). The hope of reunion with their grandchildren, while not totally unrealistic, makes it difficult to work through the grief process.

An important issue for grandparents is what access and visitation rights they have with grandchildren. Sometimes legal contact orders are the only way of obtaining these. Under the Children Act 1989 any person (not just grandparents or relatives) may seek leave to apply for an order for contact with a child. But even if the grandparent has obtained a contact order there is little that holds the parent to abide by the court ruling. The issue of what further legal rights grandparents should have continues to be debated (Chesterman et al., 2005; Ferguson et al., 2004; Jenkins, 2001).

The three-generation family relationships which can follow divorce are complex. A grandchild could have various types of step-grandparent, resulting from a parent remarrying (the most usual), a grandparent remarrying, or from the parent of a step-parent remarrying! The BSA survey found that step-grandparents generally had less contact with grandchildren than did grandparents; but an interesting finding was that step-grandfathers generally had more contact (20 per cent seeing step-grandchildren several times a week) compared with step-grandmothers (11 per cent).

In the US there are courses for grandparents (Szinovacz & Roberts, 1998). These can include components on sharing feelings and ideas with peers, listening to the views of younger people, learning about lifespan development, improving family communication skills, and focusing self-evaluation. There are also 'foster grandparent' programmes. Werner (1991) described how these give 'elders with low income the opportunity to provide companionship and caring for a variety of high-risk children and youths in return for a tax-exempt stipend' (p.78). These take place in hospitals, residential institutions, daycare programmes and family shelters. The evaluation of these programmes appears to be positive.

Research on grandparenthood is growing in strength and relevance. Now a more thorough application of theory to data collection and interpretation is needed. Theoretical perspectives can be brought from evolution, psychoanalysis and attachment theory, family systems theory, family sociology, lifespan development and gerontology. Also, most research has been in the US, and some in Europe. Further work on cross-cultural variations in the grandparent role could give a broader perspective on the topic. Among African-Americans, for example, the maternal grandmother tends to have a particularly influential role.

Although three generations are involved in grandparent/grandchild relationships, most studies have focused on the viewpoint of only one generation, via interviews or questionnaires. Sometimes, the views of grandparents have been elicited; more often, the perspective of the grandchild. However, studies which have obtained multiple perspectives regularly report some incongruence. Mangen and Miller (1988) found only moderate correlations across generations for amount of contact (.41 to .75). Disagreements can signify relationship difficulties; one father claimed to bring his children to visit the grandmother once a month, but the grandmother complained that he hardly ever came and that 'I do not see my son's children enough to know their middle names' (p.121). These differing perceptions are strongly echoed in the BSA survey findings (Dench & Ogg, 2002). They deserve more attention in future, both for their theoretical interest and possible practical benefits that might ensue if misunderstandings can be avoided.

# Importance of Grandparents to Their Grandchildren

My four-year-old daughter asks about her deceased grandparents almost daily. Her question to me or her mother usually goes something like this: "Will we see Grandma and Grandpa again someday?" Her words help us and her siblings keep in our minds and hearts these vital figures in our family's history.

Grandparents play an important role in the lives of their grandchildren, though it is often indirect. Most of their significance to children is seen through the support and help they give to their parents. Grandparents are often seen as "stress buffers," family "watchdogs," "roots," "arbitrators," and "supporters."

Research suggests that children find unique acceptance in their relationships with grandparents, which benefits them emotionally and mentally. Grandparents can be a major support during family disruptions. Sometimes they're playmates for their grandchildren. They're very often role models and mentors for younger generations. They are also historians -- teaching values, instilling ethnic heritage and passing on family traditions.

Increasing numbers of grandparents care for their grandchildren during the day or have legal full custody of their grandchildren, making them surrogate parents. These grandparents have a particularly strong influence.

For example, when my father died, my Grandpa Belnap took on an active role in my life. He was a retired junior high school math teacher with twinkling blue eyes. Grandpa Belnap cared for me while my mother, a single parent, worked hard to build a successful home-based business.

Grandpa provided me with some of my fondest and earliest memories. I remember he let me push the button to start his old Oldsmobile coupe, often at some risk to the starter motor. He was fond of saying "Whoa, Nellie" as he came to an intersection. He taught me and my siblings a nonsensical song called "Little Blue-Haired Boy," which he recorded for future generations just before he died. He always encouraged me, loved me, and supported me. When I became a teenager, Grandpa Belnap persisted in playing a part in my life even though at the time I was pretty dull of hearing the voices of older adults.

Wise parents foster strong relationships between grandparents and grandchildren. Letters, phone calls, videos, audiocassettes, sharing of school work, and personal contact where possible all build bonds of love and friendship between the generations.

Grandparents need their children and grandchildren as well. The movie "The Mailbox" conveys how important these relationships are to the elderly. It tells the story of an old widow named Leethe who loved her children, all living some distance from her, and longed to receive letters from them. She made daily walks from her house down a long pathway to her mailbox, anxiously anticipating a letter. But repeatedly she was disappointed.

On rare occasions, one of Leethe's children would call her. But Leethe was hard of hearing and preferred letters. She pleaded with her them and her grandchildren to write to her because she couldn't "read phone conversations over and over." Still, the letters didn't come.

Finally one day a letter was waiting when Leethe made her daily trek to check the mailbox. She was so excited, she rushed back to the house to get her glasses so she could read it. She had barely opened the envelope when she suffered a fatal heart attack. As it turned out, the letter was from her daughter and said only that she wanted Leethe's consent to be placed in a nursing home.

It benefits each generation to be cradled in the arms of one another's love, and Leethe's children missed those benefits - as well as deprived their mother of them.

A tender children's story reminds us of the deep satisfaction we experience when we make sure love and care flow between generations. I'll Love You Forever by Robert Munsch depicts a mother cradling her newborn infant son in her arms, and she pens the words, "I'll love you forever." By the end of the tale the roles are reversed. The son, now grown, cradles his frail, aged mother in his arms and pens the words, "I'll love you forever."

As life expectancy rises, more and more people are becoming grandparents, living to see their grandchildren grow up, and watching their grandchildren have children of their own.

Just about everyone will become a grandparent during their lifetime.1 The median age for becoming a grandmother is 45 years old, and most women will spend nearly half their lives in this role.2

Throughout these later years, both grandmothers and grandfathers can help grandchildren and great-grandchildren gain a sense of identity, give unconditional love, represent hope for the future, stand as a source of stability and security, act as a mentor, and exemplify positive values, ideals, and beliefs.

Many changes in society mean that grandparents have an unprecedented opportunity to be an influence for good in the lives of their progeny. A higher rate of divorce and more mothers in the workplace mean that grandparents are called on more than ever before to care for grandchildren. Better health and financial security for seniors gives them more resources to help succeeding generations.3,4

As Dr. Lillian Carson says, "If you’ve ever wanted to make a difference in this world, active grandparenting provides the perfect opportunity".5



Ideas about the role of grandparents have changed dramatically. The first articles about grandparents published in the 1930s and 1940s, written mostly by psychiatrists, focused on the negative effects of meddlesome grandmothers who interfered in their children’s childrearing with old-fashioned views. A 1952 study by Staples presented a kinder view, explaining that "a well-liked grandma . . . keeps up with the times . . . [and] makes the transition from a position of responsibility to rendering interested helpful service".6

By the 1960s and 1970s, grandparents were looked upon more favorably. Grandparents tended to hold less strict and authoritarian views and were more indulgent and warm than a decade before. In 1981 Kornhaber and Woodward described a "vital connection" of grandparents to grandchildren, focusing on the important influence grandparents have in the lives of their grandchildren.7 Recent research reaffirms their importance and increasingly focuses on their expanding role as a childcare provider.



Becoming a grandparent is both an exciting and stressful time. It has been called a "counter transition" because grandparents can’t control when this stage of their life begins.1 Furthermore, the transition is ongoing. Most grandparents have more than one grandchild, so they are grandparents to young grandchildren over a period of years.

This transition period may overlap with other important events and responsibilities. Most grandparents experience a period of time when they still have their own children living at home. Grandparents may also be caring for elderly parents8. As the year's progress, grandparents generally retire and often husbands pass away.

Grandparenthood does not come naturally. It requires thinking and planning.5 Dr. Carson offers the following advice on making the transition to becoming a grandparent:

The Rewards of Being a Grandparent

Grandparenthood brings many benefits. Grandparents don’t have to worry about the everyday responsibilities of childcare such as getting kids out of bed, dressed, fed, and out the door to school. They have the freedom to decide how involved they want to be in their grandchildren’s lives. Without any ultimate responsibility, they are free to savor their grandchildren’s natural spontaneity, joy, innocence, and affection.10

Research has found that most grandparents find their role satisfying. Peterson reported that grandparents enjoy their role for many reasons, including feeling young again, gaining emotional fulfillment, sharing in their grandchildren’s activities, and observing their grandchildren’s development.11 Grandparents who have the most contact with their grandchildren report the most satisfaction.

One grandmother explained why being a grandparent is fulfilling for her: "Having grandchildren is the vindication of everything I have done as a parent. When we see our children passing on our values to another generation, we know we have been successful".12

The experience of grandparenting brings more happiness than grandparents expect. Somary and Stricker found that all the grandparents in their study reported higher levels of satisfaction in their grandparenting role than they expected.13 They concluded that "one can never fully anticipate how much joy a grandchild will bring until he/she actually arrives".13

A Unique Bond between Grandparents and Grandchildren

Often a special bond connects grandparent and grandchild.5,12 Both are outside the mainstream of society: children are "too young" and grandparents are "too old." Grandparents don’t carry the parental burdens of taking care of daily needs, helping with schoolwork, chauffeuring, disciplining, etc. Because of grandparents’ wisdom, experience, and broader perspective, they are often more accepting of grandchildren. And they can afford to be more indulgent.

Victor Hugo related a story that illustrates the unique friendship between grandparent and grandchild: "My granddaughter was made to sit in a closet with no food as punishment. When I snuck her a cookie I said, ‘I could get in a lot of trouble for doing this. They may put me in the closet.’ She answered, ‘Don’t worry grandfather, then I will bring you a cookie’".5

When grandchildren become adolescents, their parents may be very emotionally involved and concerned. Grandparents’ greater emotional and physical distance can enable them to see things more objectively and more broadly. Often they can provide a listening ear without passing judgment. Many adults express fond memories of their grandparents during this period of life and express sentiments such as, "I would never have made it without my grandparents."5

Multiple Roles of Grandparents

Grandparents can have an impact on their grandchildren’s lives in many different ways. They can act as the family historian, mentor, playmate, nurturer, role model, confidante, advocate, advisor, and surrogate parent.3,14,15 They also can profoundly influence the development of their grandchildren, including the following ways:

Barusch and Steen call grandparents "keepers of community" because they often interpret and pass on knowledge of events and people in their culture.16 To help children understand their heritage, grandparents can tell stories, show pictures, do genealogy, collect family recipes, explain heirlooms, and organize family reunions.5

Joseph Kennedy Jr. remembered his Grandma Rose sharing the past with him by showing him pictures. "We thought she was just sharing old memories until she showed us an ad for employment that said ‘No Irish need apply.’ Then she admonished us to ‘never forget what our roots were’".5

Dr. Benjamin Spock wrote, "Love and enjoy your child for what he is . . . and forget about the qualities that he doesn’t have. The child who is appreciated for what he is . . . will have a spirit that will make the best of all the capacities that he has and of all the opportunities that come his way".5 Grandparents can foster self-esteem by showing constant love and acceptance through words and deeds.5

Factors that Affect Level of Influence

Research supports the idea that grandparents can have a significant positive impact on the lives of their grandchildren. Studies of grandparents who are the parents of teenage mothers show that the presence of a nurturing grandfather results in fewer negative feelings and increased obedience by grandchildren to their mother’s requests.15 Another study showed that a healthy attachment between grandmother and mother encourages healthy attachment between mother and grandchild.15

The level of grandparents’ influence depends on many factors, including the following.

Researchers have found that there is a certain period of life when becoming a grandparent is considered most normal or "on time." For women, this age is approximately between 45 and 60. Women who become grandmothers at an earlier age may try to disassociate themselves from the role because of preconceived ideas that being a grandmother means a person is old.21 They might insist "I’m too young to be a grandmother" or "I’m still too busy with my own life, children, career, and interests." Young grandmothers are more likely to feel unhappy with a grandmotherly role and unready for its responsibilities.

Timberlake and Chipungu compared how women in two different age groups perceived the value of grandchildren: African-American grandmothers 46 to 60 years old ("on-time") and African-American grandmothers 30 to 41 years old ("off-time").22 The "on-time" grandmas said their grandchildren meant more to them. Becoming a grandparent especially late in life (after 70) can also compromise the grandparent-grandchildren relationship. Older grandparents may feel dismayed that they will not get to spend much time with their grandchildren or be physically fit and able to do all the activities with them they would like to.23

In our society, fathers and grandfathers sometimes are less involved because they feel less competent at childrearing. But children need grandfathers just as much as grandmothers. The granddaughter of the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said at his funeral, "Grandpa, you are my hero. I want you to know that. Everything I did, I always saw you before me".5

Grandfathers who had busy work schedules when they were raising their families sometimes take a special interest in grandchildren as a way of making up for what they missed with their own children. Parents can involve grandfathers by seeking their input and not assuming that grandmothers are more interested in grandparenting.

Grandparents with higher levels of education tend to participate in more activities with their grandchildren, discuss problems, talk about their grandkids’ future, and act as a teacher. They are more likely to teach skills and give advice.28

Understanding Young Grandchildren

In order to be the best grandparent one can be, it is important to understand the development of grandchildren.5 Erik Erikson offered a model of the life cycle with eight stages corresponding to eight emotional tasks to be learned. Five of the stages are explained below.

Stage One: Birth to 2 years

During this stage, children learn to develop trust. If their needs are met and they feel safe and secure, they will become trusting. Grandparents can be helpful at this stage by providing positive encouragement to parents and by babysitting occasionally to give parents time alone, which in turn helps them maintain a healthy marriage. They should interact with the baby by talking, singing, holding, rocking, and playing, but allow the infant to have alone time, too.

Stage Two: 2 to 4 years

This stage includes the "terrible twos" when "NO!" becomes a child’s favorite word and he wants to do everything himself as he tries to achieve autonomy. There is nothing more frustrating than arguing with a two-year-old or three-year-old, so avoid these power struggles and keep your sense of humor. For example, when your granddaughter says "no" to going inside, simply take her by the hand and gently lead her in.

Children are learning to separate from their parents during this stage, so providing opportunities for positive experiences away from mommy and daddy can help foster autonomy. Encourage exploration by taking them on nature walks and providing opportunities for social interaction with others.

Stage Three: 4 to 7 years

Initiative is the task children work on at this age; they love to plan, make, and do. Grandparents can help by introducing new ideas, skills, projects, and hobbies. Children at this age love being given small jobs but still need guidance. You might squeeze oranges together, wash the car, garden, etc. Take them seriously and respect what they are feeling.

Children at this stage also love to play and pretend. Using their imagination stimulates creativity. When pretending together, understand that children like to repeat the same play situations over and over. To avoid getting bored, try to vary the theme but don’t control their imagination.

Stage Four: 7 to 13 years

This is the stage for attaining industry. Children are ready to work and need opportunities to learn. School fills many of these needs, and you can encourage further work and learning by doing projects with your grandchildren such as baking cookies, making a birdhouse, taking them on outings, telling stories, and encouraging interest in music, sports, art, and nature.

Stage Five: 14 to 22 years

This is the prime time when children seek to find their identity. Peers become more important and parents less important. "You can be a stabilizing influence at a time when parents can’t reach them"5 (p. 85). Be available to listen and avoid judging. Relate to them by sharing personal experiences and your ideas and philosophies of life but without lecturing. Encourage them to try hard in school and pursue their interests. Teach them about their cultural heritage. Support their parents. Have adventures together. Teach them constructive problem-solving.

Enjoying Adult Grandchildren

People are living longer than ever before, and today it is more the rule than the exception to have at least one grandchild over the age of 18.2 Only recently has the relationship between grandparents and their adult grandchildren been a subject of researchers’ attention.

The role of grandparents changes as grandchildren grow up, get married and have children of their own. Although contact and proximity usually decrease as the grandchild becomes independent, the relationship is still influential and important. A large proportion of adult grandchildren keep in regular contact with their closest grandparent.1 Their relationship with grandparents comes to be based on friendship rather than obligation.26 More than 80% of teenagers see their grandparents as someone they can confide in. Good relationships with young grandchildren grow into good relationships with adult grandchildren.1

The most significant effect grandparents have on adult grandchildren is in the area of value development. Studies of college students found that grandparents were important in establishing political, religious, sexual, moral, and educational values as well as family ideals, work ethic, and identity.15 Grandparents often continue to give emotional and financial support to adult grandchildren, and grandchildren, in turn, feel a responsibility to care for grandparents in their old age.17

In his study of adult grandchildren and grandfathers, Taylor found that nearly all participants felt at least "somewhat emotionally close" and viewed the role of grandfather as "very important."29 Adult grandchildren expected their grandfathers to not let them down, be a good example, treat their grandmother kindly, and show love and acceptance.

Among the activities that help to bring adult grandchildren and grandfathers closer are family get-togethers (reunions, birthday celebrations, picnics, holidays), working together, recreational activities (games, puzzles, hunting, fishing), and conversing. Taylor concludes that a strong bond is based on frequent contact, serving one another, and talking to each other.29

Maintaining Long-Distance Relationships with Grandchildren

When living far away, it is important to keep in touch with your grandchildren and be with them in spirit.5 Make a list of important dates to remember such as birthdays, recitals, and sports competitions. Do something special to acknowledge these events.

Talking on the phone is a great way to keep in contact. Children are never too young to listen to your voice. Here are some guidelines for telephone calls:

Letters are a wonderful way to let grandchildren know you’re thinking of them. They also provide a tangible memento. Children love to get letters in the mail. Include small items like stickers or pictures to let them know you’re thinking of them. Encourage their writing skills by asking them to write back. To help them know you better, tape-record yourself reading a story or send pictures of yourself doing something you do frequently.

Email provides for quick and easy communication. Websites that allow families to have their own web pages offer a place to show photos, share anecdotes, and remind of special dates.12

Make Visits Meaningful and Enjoyable

When you travel to visit your grandchildren, try to keep visits brief (about three days)--"leave them wanting more".5 If you stay longer, be aware that you are disrupting the family’s routine and try to be respectful of it. Here are some practical ideas for keeping visits enjoyable:

When grandchildren travel to visit you:

Giving Gifts

Gifts show your grandchildren you love them and value them. It is important to get parents’ permission first to avoid possible problems. Think about what effect you want your gift to have. Should it encourage learning, develop skills, introduce new ideas, be just for fun, encourage play? Don’t wait only for special occasions or you may miss opportunities to foster learning and growth. Gifts don’t have to be expensive. Here are some ideas for gifts:



A New York survey found the dismaying statistic that 50% of people 60 years and older can expect a married child to divorce.30 Divorce affects grandparents in many ways. Ties to family tend to decrease. Divorce sometimes offends the values held by grandparents, straining the grandparent-child relationship.

Divorce also often causes a "reorientation of kinship".31 Mothers, who most often gain custody of children, may turn to maternal grandparents for financial support and childcare. Thus ties to the maternal grandparents increase while paternal grandparents may be left without a direct link to their grandchildren. Often, though, paternal grandparents are able to remain a part of their grandchildren’s lives if they have a continuing friendship with the mother. They also can make efforts to see their grandchildren when the children are with their father. Conflicts of loyalty may result in paternal grandparents if the father remarries a woman with children of her own.

Adjusting to divorce is made more difficult by the lack of ritual associated with it. No one really knows how to act after a divorce and there are no rules for relationships with extended family of the "other side. Divorce is a state of "social limbo".31 Despite this confusion, divorce calls for grandparents to play a more active role in their grandchildren’s lives than they otherwise might. Grandparents can act as an essential source of stability and continuity at a time when their grandchildren are almost certainly feeling insecure and distressed.

The natural tendency when an adult child is divorcing is to side with that child and not with the child’s spouse. Grandparents should do their best to resist this tendency and stay as neutral as possible for the sake of their grandchildren. Divorcing parents are likely to be feeling strong emotions, and grandparents can act as mediators and offer unbiased support—if they haven’t taken sides. This support may include taking care of grandchildren, giving financial aid, listening sympathetically, encouraging and participating in family rituals that help provide normalcy (such as birthdays, graduations, holidays), and planning fun activities for grandchildren. Strom and Strom advise grandparents to be a friend to their grandchildren and wait patiently while their role after a divorce is redefined.20

Grandparents as Childcare Providers

Grandparents are increasingly being asked to provide childcare for their grandchildren.27 The level of care varies greatly. Some grandparents may be asked to provide occasional babysitting or temporary childcare. This fits within the traditional role of noninterference in childrearing, and a majority of grandparents provide this service. Routine or long-term care, however, requires a large investment of time and effort. Research shows that grandparents generally believe parents should be the primary caregivers, that adult children should live on their own, and that grandparents should be called upon for help only when it is necessary.32

The usual role of giving parents a break by babysitting or helping in an emergency has expanded greatly for reasons that include:

Grandparents as Surrogate Parents

Full-time care is needed when a parent leaves or is unable to provide care. This situation takes the grandparent out of the traditional role and requires reorganizing and redefining relationships.27 If grandparents accept the role of full-time caregiver, they become "surrogate parents." Surrogate parenting usually falls under one of two scenarios:

Coresidence is more common and usually happens during a transition in the parent’s life such as divorce, changing jobs, unemployment, or poverty. In 1997 about 11% of grandparents reported having had a grandchild live with them.32

Effect of Surrogate Parenting on Children

During this stressful time, grandparents can be a source of secure attachment for young children. The more contact a grandmother has with her grandchildren, the more she acts like a mother as a base of attachment. In studies with families where teenage mothers received assistance from the grandparents, grandfathers were seen to have a positive influence on their grandchild, probably by providing a male role model of nurturance and cooperation.34

Brown and colleagues compared school-age children in two-parent and single families and children residing with grandparents and found no significant difference in physical health.35 Their emotional well-being was generally good, but over half the children experienced some negative effects because of their parents’ absence. Solomon and Marx concluded that children living with grandparents were not as successful in school as children living with both parents and were less likely to complete high school.36

Effect of Surrogate Parenting on Grandparents

The effort, time, and devotion demanded for full-time childcare affects grandparents as well. Most grandparents expect they will be part of an ideal scenario that includes voluntary visits and fun with grandchildren. As one woman said, "They come to see me, I dote on them and buy them things".36 When grandparents are full-time caregivers, however, they can’t enjoy this limited role. They don’t have the freedom to be indulgent and unconditionally accepting because they have to worry about discipline, school, meals, homework, etc. Most feel increased fatigue from the demands of caring for children.

Grandparents are generally not eager to take over the care of grandchildren, as it can be overwhelming and often is a result of family trauma. Grandparents involved in full-time care may have less time for their spouse, friends, and themselves. In their study on the effects of caregiving on grandparents, Bowers and Myers compared grandmothers giving full-time, part-time, and no care to grandchildren.21 They found that the majority of full-time and part-time caregivers felt they had an excellent relationship with their grandchildren. Full-time caregivers were more likely to experience a negative change in their relationship with their spouse, including loss of privacy and husbands becoming jealous of time spent with grandchildren. Full-time caregivers experienced higher levels of burden and stress that were associated with more behavior problems in their grandchildren. Part-time caregivers reported the most satisfaction in their role as grandmother.

Grandparents face many unique issues as surrogate parents. Role confusion often occurs, with grandchildren, especially very young ones, not knowing what to call their grandma. One grandmother said her two-year-old grandchild always calls her "mama" but also calls his real mother "mama." She wonders if he will be confused about having two mamas as he gets older. Another grandma worried if she had done the right thing in telling her four-year-old grandchild that he should not call her "mama" but "Nana."

Many grandparents express feeling sadness in their role. They may wonder what they did wrong or feel disappointed in their son or daughter. And they may grieve for the loss of the grandparenting role they hoped for: "You cannot be a grandparent and a parent too. You grieve because it hasn’t turned out like you thought. You expected to rear children and then to sit back and be a grandparent. Now I can’t be a grandparent. I have to be a parent . . . again".36

On the positive side, grandparents providing full-time care enjoy getting to know their grandchildren. "There’s nothing better than warm baby snuggle to get your day off to a good start (p. 41),"36 said one grandma. Surrogate parenting also gives grandparents an opportunity to pass on their values and give more experienced advice and guidance than when they were parents. Ninety-six percent of the full-time caregivers in Bowers and Meyer’s study said if they had the chance to do it over, they would take on the responsibility again.21

Ideas for Coping When Grandparents Are Surrogate Parents

Strom and Strom suggest that grandparents raising grandchildren are more likely to be successful if they do the following:20,19

The Brookdale Foundation, a national association devoted to grandparents, funds a Grandparent Information Center that collects and distributes information about grandparenting. They also coordinate support groups. Another organization, Raising Our Children’s Kids: An Intergenerational Network of Grandparenting (ROCKING) has a directory of local support groups. These support groups, while usually not funded or run by trained professionals, allow grandparents to support one another and give each other ideas, tips, and a listening ear.38

Recent research emphasizes the important role grandparents play in their grandchildren's lives. Scholars have found that grandparents often serve as a role model, friend, caregiver, family historian, mentor, and source of unconditional love for their grandchildren.

This research confirms gospel teachings about the family. Latter-day Saints believe that families are eternal, and grandparents are an important link in the unbroken chain that binds families together.

Elder L. Tom Perry said, "How glorious are the Lord's teachings to his children that there can be eternal family associations with grandparents, parents, children, and grandchildren in one eternal family organization".1 He also taught the importance of the extended family: "To build a foundation strong enough to support a family in our troubled world today requires the best effort of each of us--father, mother, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, uncles, cousins".2

One of grandparents' most important responsibilities is to help parents teach children. In the Book of Mormon, King Benjamin advised his people of their duty to teach children: "But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another" (Mosiah 4:15). Elder M. Russell Ballard taught that it is not only parents who have this responsibility to teach: "Parents share this sacred trust with . . . grandparents . . . and all who touch the lives and impress or influence the souls of those precious children".3

Grandparents who teach their grandchildren to live and love the gospel, especially by their example, give a gift of eternal value. President Ezra Taft Benson said an important way grandparents can be examples is by writing their personal histories, sharing experiences, testimonies, and faith from their own lives.4 They can also be family historians, helping children learn about their ancestors and turning the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers (Malachi 4:6).

Serving missions is another way grandparents can be an example of righteousness. Elder Hales promised that grandparents who are willing to leave their families to serve in the mission field will bring blessings to their families, including reactivation of family members, baptisms, and strengthened testimonies.5

Grandparents can also set an example for succeeding generations by working in the temple, accepting and fulfilling Church callings, and giving Christ-like service.4

The Family: A Proclamation to the World states that "extended families should lend support when needed" (¶ 7). Grandparents thus can help with childcare, be available in times of need, and lend emotional support. They can help make the home a safe, secure haven where children learn morals and values.6

One of the best gifts grandparents can give grandchildren is time. Elder Neal A. Maxwell pleaded with parents and grandparents to "scrutinize your schedules and priorities in order to ensure that life's prime relationships get more prime time!"7

President Benson suggested that grandparents nurture their relationships with grandchildren by reading books with them, sharing stories, and helping them gain a gospel perspective of life.4 Grandparents who live far away can send letters, tapes, and photos. They should make their best efforts to attend special family events such as graduations, weddings, temple trips, missionary farewells and homecomings, baby blessings, and baptisms.

President and Sister Gordon B. Hinckley exemplify good grandparenting.8 First, they make time for their grandchildren. Their extended family gathers at least once a month for family home evening. They invite grandchildren to accompany them on speaking assignments or temple dedications. They show interest in their grandchildren's lives by asking about each individually, inquiring about school, sports, dating, etc. A special tradition is to hold a Christmas party for the grandchildren without their parents.

President Hinckley worries about the problems they face in an increasingly difficult world and offers advice and prayers to help them. He stays in touch with current culture so he can understand their challenges. Sister Hinckley keeps her grandchildren in mind while traveling, often sending letters and postcards from all over the world.

It is a grandparent's duty to help teach and raise grandchildren in the light of the gospel. By being good examples and making the effort to be involved in their grandchildren's lives, grandparents can be of invaluable service and influence.

# Attachment grandparenting…what’s your role? – APtly Said

Parenting with Attachment in Mind

By Lysa Parker, cofounder of Attachment Parenting International (API) and coauthor of Attached at the Heart with Barbara Nicholson

Editor’s note: Happy Grandparents Day! The grandparent-grandchild bond can be an important relationship in any child’s life, as a complement to a secure parent-child attachment. Today, API encourages grandparents to explore their influence in their grandchild’s life as an advocate for — and available support, as needed, to — the parents.

My husband Jim and I have a blended family, and our first experience with grandchildren began 14 years ago when our twin grandsons were born. We discovered that Attachment Grandparenting requires a very active role in several ways.

Advocating for the Family

Morgan, my step-daughter, was a single mother. I was able to attend my grandsons’ births and hold them soon after. The nurses offered to take them to the nursery, because their mother was recovering from a Cesarean section and was very weak, but Jim and I felt very protective of our grandsons and told them we would hold the babies. We held and rocked them for as long as we could and as often as we could until their mother felt better.

I helped Morgan with breastfeeding when she was having difficulty getting her sleepy babies to latch, and Jim and I helped Morgan prepare for safe bedsharing with twins and made sure she ate healthy and rested often. Morgan breastfed her twins for almost a year, and they thrived.

We proudly wore our grandsons around the neighborhood and savored our time with them until they moved back to Houston, Texas, USA, when they were about 10 months old. We missed them terribly, and we weren’t able to see them as often as we wanted. Still on some deep and inexplicable level, we made a connection with them that no distance could sever. Whenever we would visit, they always wanted to sit on our laps or be next to us. At night, we would help them get ready for bed and they would ask us to carry them to bed, as if remembering the many times we held and rocked them when they were babies.

In the blink of an eye, they became teenagers, and if we are lucky we see them once a year, but the bond is there. There’s no doubt to us as to the mysterious and profound nature of that bond established in just the first weeks and months of life.

Why is Grandparenting So Wonderful?

I’ve always heard from others about how wonderful it is to be a grandparent. I feel so fortunate to have the opportunity to live close to my granddaughter and build our relationship. We enjoy supporting her parents and being a resource for them, something we never had as young parents. Being a grandparent is freeing: We don’t have as many unrealistic expectations and stressors that we did when younger.

Making Ripples

We, at API, often talk about the ripple effect we can create by the little changes each of us makes in our families and in our communities. I want to share how empowering and far-reaching some experiences can be.

Morgan grew up in California, USA, so we had a long-distance relationship with her that included summer visits. She was not exposed to breastfeeding when she was growing up, other than when she herself was breastfed for a short time as an infant. Nor did she have a lot of exposure to caring for children. So the fact that she was able to breastfeed her twin boys for as long as she did was due to her living with us and getting a lot of support from me and her father.

Years later, after moving to Houston with her babies, Morgan had a friend who gave birth to twins — one of whom had special needs — in a local hospital. Morgan encouraged her friend to breastfeed. While Morgan was visiting her friend at the hospital, a nurse came into the room and was shocked that Morgan’s friend was attempting to breastfeed the infants and discouraged her from doing so. That’s when Morgan told the nurse that she was able to successfully nurse twins and so could her friend, that in no uncertain terms should the nurse be discouraging breastfeeding for this mother.

I felt such pride for Morgan that her own breastfeeding experience gave her such courage and conviction to help another mother. No doubt the ripple effect continues in other ways.

Offering Support

Our most recent experience in Attachment Grandparenting began in May 2013 when our granddaughter, Layla McCartney Parker, was born to our son, Jamison, and daughter-in-law, Jordan.

As experienced parents know, there can many real and potential challenges during pregnancy and childbirth, many of which first-time parents just don’t know. There are a lot of choices and a lot of decisions to be made, and unless you’re clear about what you want, it can be overwhelming to say the least. There are important decisions to be made that can have a huge impact on birth and breastfeeding experiences.

Jordan was unfamiliar with Attachment Parenting and new to API’s Eight Principles of Parenting. When I offered, Jordan and Jamison were very open to learning about Attachment Parenting and allowed me to help them navigate through the myriad options, such as finding supportive childbirth classes, creating a birth plan, attending La Leche League meetings and creating a safe sleep environment ahead of time. They knew, too, that my husband and I would be their support system after the baby arrived, if and when they needed us.

Both Jordan and Jamison really wanted a natural birth but were uncertain how to make that happen. That’s where local hynobirthing classes were immensely helpful, as well as the support of a caring and experienced doula. Jordan arrived at the hospital at 9 centimeters, and with Jamison and the doula by her side trying to keep her relaxed and focused, Layla was born within an hour — all naturally.

Just when we thought it was all over, the nurses wanted to give pitocin to help Jordan recover. That blind-sided everyone! Natural birth is natural birth, right?

Since I hadn’t arrived at the hospital yet, my son anxiously texted me about what he should do and was confused because he didn’t expect this after his wife just finished a natural birth. So was I, but I assured him that pitocin wasn’t necessary to help Jordan “recover” and that putting the baby to the breast would help her recover just as quickly by helping to expel the placenta. They refused the pitocin, and everything went great from that point on, from skin-to-skin holding to breastfeeding.

Enriching the Grandchild’s Life


This time around, we have the opportunity to be engaged in our granddaughter’s life on a regular basis, especially since her daddy is the stay-at-home parent for now. The love we feel for her is intoxicating! I will often get the urge to see her and call to ask if I can come over and play. Usually my son is eager for a little break in his day.

Babies are born to expect at least 4 adults to enrich their lives. Jim and I have made a conscious effort to see her at least twice a week, so we are very familiar faces and voices.

I have developed a special relationship with Layla in terms of singing lullabies to her. She was just a couple months old when I began to sing to her, and she would look at me intensely with a face of recognition whenever I sang a familiar song. We know infants like repetition, so I make sure I sing the older lullabies and add new ones along the way. It gives me great joy to see her big smile when I sing to her. She loves music and has even gone to hear her “Poppy” — Jim is a musician — play his guitar in concert without making a peep. She is mesmerized by the guitar and music. For me, music is the language of the soul, and I hope we always keep that special relationship with her and nurture her love for music.

Layla is 10 months old now, and she is the light of our lives. I wear her as often as I can when I care for her. I rock her and sing her to sleep and love to play with her when she’s awake, delighting in every little milestone. And I delight in watching my son and his wife grow into their parenting role. We also love watching our twin grandsons grow into young men and cherish our relationship with them.

Do I sound like I’m in love with Attachment Grandparenting? You bet I am!

Affection exchange theory (AET) explains the value of received affection for overall wellbeing in family relationships. However, this study extends prior work by investigating AET in grandmother-grandchild relationships and grandchildren’s individual well-being. This study seeks to understand the relationships between adult grandchildren’s received grandmother affection and health-related behaviors such as diet, exercise, substance abuse, and sleep.

This cross-sectional study included 229 university student participants. Multiple regression analyses were performed to analyze received grandmother affection and grandchildren’s health behaviors.

Using cross-sectional survey methods, it was found that grandchildren’s reports of received memories and humor, and celebratory affection influenced grandchildren’s dietary behaviors. Received love and esteem, memories and humor, and celebratory affection was also associated with grandchildren’s exercise behaviors.

Grandchildren who receive grandmother affection may be likely to engage in the well-being process by engaging in health behaviors, while those who are not receiving affection might suffer the health consequences in adulthood. These findings support the assumption of affection exchange theory that received family affection, in this case, grandmother affection leads to positive health outcomes such as enhanced dietary and exercise behaviors among grandchildren.



Peer Review reports


Grandparents often play a significant role in individuals’ lives. Several young adults report that their relationship with their grandparents is one of their most valued relationships [1, 2]. Young adults report receiving much of their early caregiving from one, or two grandparents [3]. A Pew Research Center report from 2013 indicated that 7 million grandparents served as their grandchildren’s caregivers and 7.7 million grandchildren were living with their grandparents, and 3 million of these grandchildren had a grandparent as their primary caregiver who fulfilled the grandchildren’s basic needs (e.g., food; shelter), which was a 22% increase from 2000, and 22% of grandparents provided regular care [4, 5]. Early parenthood, divorce, and separation from parents can sometimes transfer the caregiving role responsibility to the grandparents [4, 6]. Not only do grandparents provide basic resources to fulfill their basic needs (e.g., food; shelter), but they also nurture the well-being of their grandchildren by providing affection to them [7]. Grandparents’ affection has been shown to have a significant positive impact in their grandchildren’s personal lives [7, 8]. A study found that grandparents report spending about 11 to 20 h a week caring and bonding with their grandchildren [9].

Grandparent-grandchild communication can also play a role in grandchildren’s individual well-being. For instance, research supports the idea that withholding affection from a young adult can have negative health effects such as stress and mental health issues (i.e., depression) [10, 11], but some evidence suggests that received grandparent affection is not significantly inversely related with grandchildren’s health outcomes (i.e., stress) [12]. However, evidence suggests that when grandmother communicate affectionately to their grandchildren, the expressed affection strengthens the grandmother-grandchild relationship and it enhances grandmothers’ general well-being [13]. However, while researchers have investigated grandchildren’s perspectives on their relationship with their grandmother, the construct of grandmother received affection has been understudied in relation to grandchildren’s health outcomes. It is important to examine the positive influence of received grandmother affection on young adults’ health behaviors because these relationships can inform about the value of intergenerational relationships from a health perspective. Because received affection has been shown to be beneficial to the health of other family relationships such as parental and romantic [14], this study will aim at investigating the grandmother-grandchild relationship using Affection Exchange Theory, which states that received affection may lead to positive health outcomes [15]. As such, the objective of this paper is to examine the role of perceived grandparents’ affection and their adult grandchildren’s perceived health behavioral outcomes.

The grandparent-grandchild (GP-GC) relationship is one of the most esteemed relationships that a grandchild can have [16]. Studies have shown that grandchildren tend to view their grandparent relationship almost as important as their relationship with their parental relationship [17, 18]. Because college-aged grandchildren value their relationships with their grandparents they tend to use behaviors to maintain their grandparent-grandchild relationship [19, 20]. For instance, grandchildren report engaging in relationship maintenance behaviors, or actions such as being more optimistic in interactions, the use of conflict management, using assurances, and openness to maintain their relationship with their grandparent [19]. These relational maintenance behaviors ensure that a quality GP-GC relationship is maintained [21].

It has also been shown that college student grandchildren are driven to communicate regularly with their grandparents [19]. For instance, when college students are in desperation, or in moments of distress, they tend to increase their communication with their grandparents to provide financial or emotional support [22]. Rarely, it is the case that grandparents live in the same household as the grandchild, but in some culturally diverse families (e.g., Latino families, Asian-American families) adult grandchildren report living with their grandparents, which enhance the frequency of their everyday communication [23, 24]. However, the average grandparent-grandchild relationship of students attending college live away from their grandparents and this (GP-GC) relationship is sustained as a long-distance relationship [19]. These long-distance GP-GC relationships are maintained by using a variety of communication channels such as face-to-face, telephone, and email [25].

Researchers have found several factors that influence GP-GC interactions including perceived relational closeness [26], accommodating interactive patterns [27], self-disclosure [28], and conversation topics [29]. Through the communication process grandchildren tend to learn values, attitudes toward aging, and family histories [30, 20]. The sex of the grandparent also has an effect in shaping the range of topics that are discussed during a conversation. For example, in a content analysis, Nussbaum and Bettini (1994) discovered that grandmothers spoke about family matters and with greater length, while grandfathers talked about their own youth, morals, and health.

While both grandparents are valued by their grandchildren, grandmother-grandchild relationships are reported to be the closest [31]. Part of the reason is that the grandmother-grandchild relationship that is nurtured during childhood has been shown to be a positive predictor of the quality of the grandmother-grandchild relationship in adulthood [32, 33]. Another reason is that due to gender norms established by society, grandmothers are often expected to serve as nurturers and contribute to the caregiving of the early years of their grandchildren [34]. The relationship development between grandmothers and their grandchildren has been shown to be facilitated by the emotional attachment and feelings of relational closeness that have been established [35]. Grandchildren also report seeking more social and emotional support from their grandmothers than their grandfathers [36]. When encountering problems, college-age adults tend to self-disclose their problems to their grandmothers to be able to vent with someone they feel comfortable with [37]. For this reason, this investigation will focus on examining grandmother-grandchild relationships.

Affection Exchange Theory (AET) is grounded in Darwin’s principle that humans exchange affection to achieve the survival and procreation of the human species [38, 39]. AET describes that humans are internally driven to both provide and receive affection in their relationships to sustain genetic fitness [39]. Affectionate communication is “defined as encompassing those behaviors that encode feelings of fondness and intense positive regard and are generally decoded as such by their intended receivers” [40] (p. 312). Affection can be expressed using verbal and nonverbal communication [38, 39]. Affection exchange theory (AET) has served as an important theory in understanding grandparent-grandchild relationships. For instance, grandparents can communicate affection to enact the liking process of their grandchildren, which can in turn, increase the likelihood that grandchildren will reciprocate the affectionate behavior to nurture a bond in the grandparent-grandchild (GP-GC) relationship [41, 7, 8].

Several studies have shown that there are four main factors that conceptualize grandchildren received affection, which include love and esteem, caring, memories and humor, and celebratory affection [7, 12]. Love and esteem refer to “expressions of love, compliments, relationship importance, and recipient self-worth” [12] (p. 81). Caring refers to an expression of concern toward a grandchild’s life and serving as an attentive listener [12] (p. 80). Memories and humor refers to the sharing of stories, and this includes “jokes and humor” [12] (p. 81). Lastly, celebratory affection refers to “acknowledging special occasions” that are important to a grandchild’s life (i.e., sending a birthday card) [12] (p. 81). Thus, these four factors have conceptualized grandchildren received affection from their grandparents.

This study’s purpose is to use AET framework to explore whether grandmother affection is linked to their adult grandchildren’s practice of health behaviors including dietary behaviors, exercise behaviors, substance abuse behaviors, and sleep habit behaviors. Given that AET framework suggests that people maintain relational bonds to promote survival and procreation [38, 39], it is important to examine whether grandchildren received affection is linked to grandchildren’s health behaviors, which may prolong their overall health and well-being [42].

While previous studies have highlighted the correlation between health outcomes and expressed affection [43,44,45], this study seeks to examine the health behavior outcomes of received affection in GP-GC relationships. Most of the literature has provided significant attention to expressed affection, but there is still a need to further investigate the role of received affection to grandchildren’s health outcomes [46]. Previous research has examined received affection in other family relational contexts. For example, Schrodt al. (2007) found that received parental affection mediated the relationship between open conversation patterns and adult children’s self-esteem and mental health [47]. More recently, Floyd (2014), found that being deprived from receiving affection is linked to mental health issues (i.e., loneliness, depression). The main study that has examined received affection and health outcomes in GP-GC relationships has been conducted by Mansson (2013c), which found that young adult grandchildren’s mental well-being (e.g., stress, depression, loneliness) was negatively correlated with certain types of received affection (e.g., memories and humor, celebratory). However, Mansson (2013c) did not find a link between grandchildren’s mental well-being and love and esteem, or caring affection. Thus, this study seeks to extend the work of health behavioral outcomes and received affection by investigating behavioral health outcomes and received affection in GP-GC relationships. To our knowledge, there has not been a study that has examined the link between received affection and health behavioral outcomes of grandchildren. Because studies have emphasized relationship characteristics such as the relational closeness and intimacy in the grandmother-grandchild relationship, there is a gap in not knowing the health outcomes of received grandmother affection. Researchers that have looked at health outcomes have focused on grandparents’ health outcomes, such as Kelley et al. (2020) and Tang et al. (2016) who found that grandparents who raise grandchildren who achieve relational closeness gain positive mental health and well-being benefits [48, 49]. The present study seeks to extend prior work by examining grandmothers’ received affection in the grandmother-grandchild relationship, and investigating the positive links to grandchildren health outcomes.

Previous research has examined the role of emotional and social support to behavioral outcomes in a variety of relational contexts. For instance, receiving social support from a peer has shown to influence young adult’s diet, exercise, sleep, and substance abuse [50, 51]. Peer support has also been shown to increase the odds of promoting healthy behaviors such as making healthier diet decisions, sleeping adequately, exercising regularly, and avoiding substance use [51, 52]. In another study that examined the role of grandparents and parents, it was found that grandparents and parent caregivers who withheld affection and used harsh discipline methods such as spanking and screaming and poor monitoring led to increased substance abuse risks such as binge drinking, marijuana use, and cigarette use [53]. Additionally, O’Leary and Butler (2015) found evidence that grandparents provide social and financial support by funding grandchildren’s drug rehabilitation treatments to aid the reduction of substance abuse behavior [54]. Another study found that when parents engage in substance abuse behavior, grandparents become more involved in the care of their grandchildren, and grandparents take the responsibility to talk about issues related to substance abuse and also provided emotional support to their grandchildren to prevent grandchildren from engaging in future substance abuse [55]. Moreover, it has been found that isolated young adults who do not feel emotionally cared for, or supported tend to be at a higher risk for alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and drug use [56]. Other studies have also found that those without emotional bonds and support systems risk adopting unhealthy patterns such as making poor diet choices (e.g., donuts, soda), lack of physical activity, inadequate sleep, and substance abuse [50, 57,58,59]. Because grandmothers are more likely to express higher levels of affection to their grandchildren than grandfathers given their gender socialization of being expected to be nurturing and caring toward their grandchildren, this study will exclude grandfathers [60]. Prior studies have established preliminary evidence of the caregiving role of grandparents on grandchildren’s health behaviors; however, this study will extend prior work by examining whether young adult grandchildren’s health behaviors (i.e., diet, sleep, substance abuse) are influenced by the received affection from their grandmothers.

Several studies have investigated grandchildren’s healthy eating patterns and exercise behaviors, and they find that caregiver figures, such as grandparents are influential in the health decision making process. For instance, Farrow (2014) found that grandparents provided healthier meals and role modeled healthy food intake behavior to their grandchildren in comparison to parents, and grandparents were able to provide grandchildren with healthy food to help their grandchildren engage in emotional regulation [61]. Another study found that grandparents provided breakfast and lunch to their younger grandchildren and dinner for older grandchildren including fresh fruit, vegetables, milk, grain and cereal foods, and meat [62]. In terms of physical engagement, Viguer et al. (2010) found that grandchildren engage in physical activities with their grandparents such as going for a walk, going to the park, going camping, and going to the beach [63]. In terms of sleep behaviors, Li et al. (2021) found that grandparents can have a higher influence on their grandchildren’s sleep behaviors such as resisting bedtime in comparison to their parents [64]. Further, another study found that grandmothers tend to have an influence on children who are at a high risk for substance abuse disorders [65]. A family’s history of substance abuse (i.e., alcohol) also can affect college students’ alcohol consumption [66]. These studies suggest that the relationships in the family context may influence young adult’s health behaviors.

Affection exchange theory provides an opportunity to investigate whether received affection is linked to health behavioral outcomes (i.e., diet, exercise, substance abuse, sleep). As discussed previously, AET discusses the main role for promoting survival and procreation [38, 39]. If grandchildren receive affection from their grandmothers, they may be more likely to make wiser health behavioral decisions, which can help them live longer and attract higher quality mates in the mate selection process [67, 38, 50]. Thus, if grandchildren eat healthier, exercise regularly, sleep adequately, and avoid substance abuse (e.g., alcohol, drugs), then they may be more likely to remain genetically fit [67]. As we know, affection provides positive benefits to individuals’ emotional well-being, but it is not yet known whether this is the case for their health behavioral patterns. Thus, the objective of this study is to examine the health outcomes of received affection from grandmothers in relation to grandchildren’s health behaviors (i.e., dietary behaviors, exercise behaviors, substance abuse behaviors, and sleep habit behaviors). Based on AET’s predictions and the previous literature findings that connect received affection with health behavioral outcomes, the following set of hypotheses are posed to investigate whether received affection from grandmothers is positively connected to young adult grandchildren’s reports of health behaviors.

H1: Received affection from grandmothers (i.e., love and esteem, caring, memories and humor, and celebratory) is positively related to grandchildren’s reports of their dietary behaviors.

H2: Received affection from grandmothers (i.e., love and esteem, caring, memories and humor, and celebratory) is positively related to grandchildren’s reports of their exercise behaviors.

H3: Received affection from grandmothers (i.e., love and esteem, caring, memories and humor, and celebratory) is inversely related to grandchildren’s reports of their substance abuse behaviors.

H4: Received affection from grandmothers (i.e., love and esteem, caring, memories and humor, and celebratory) is positively related to grandchildren’s reports of their sleep habit behaviors.

This study used a cross-sectional approach with a convenience sampling design. The sample included (67.2% women and 32.8% men) 229 students in a large Western university in the United States. The average age of the participants was 19 (SD = 3.05; range = 18-40). The ethnic background of participants was composed of 18.8% European-American, 6.1% African-American, 2.6% Native-American, 16.6% Asian-American, 44.5% Hispanic-American, and 11.4% Other. The highest education level of education indicated by the participants was 30.6% high school graduate, 63.3% some college, 3.1% college graduate, .4% some high school/GED, and 2.6% post graduate. The highest level of education that their grandmother achieved was 54% some high school, 24.4% high school graduate, 2.8% technical training, 7.5% some college, 8.5% college graduate, and 2.8% post graduate. The nature of their perceived relationship identified was 82.5% biological and 17.5% non-biological.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of a mid-sized, western public university in the United States (#110513). Participants were recruited in communication courses from the College of Fine Arts and Humanities. Faculty distributed the recruitment letter of this study in their courses. Participants were invited to participate in an online grandparent survey in exchange of a small amount of extra credit (2% of total course points). The inclusion criterion was that participants had to be at least 18 years of age and have had an existing biological or non-biological grandmother-grandchild relationship that was perceived to be close. To comply with the IRB’s ethical guidelines, participants completed a virtual consent form prior to completing the questionnaire. The timing of the sampling was during the fall months of October 15 to December 15. Participants that provided consent to participate were referred to a web link via Qualtrics to complete a 15 min questionnaire. In addition, participants were asked to respond to questions about their demographics, their received grandmothers’ affectionate communication, and their health behaviors.

The Grandchildren Received Affection Scale [19] was used to assess grandchildren’s perceptions of their grandmother’s affection using a 17-item, 7-point Likert Scale. Mansson (2013) validated this scale with effective reliability using Cronbach’s alpha values [19]. The initial reliabilities of the subscales included love and esteem (α = .91, n = 5), caring (α = .91, n = 5), memories and humor (α = .78, n = 4), and celebratory affection (α = .73, n = 3) [19]. In the present study, SPSS was used to calculate Cronbach’s alpha reliability values. The summation subscales and the alpha reliabilities of the subscales in this study include love and esteem (α = .96), caring (α = .96), memories and humor (α = .94), and celebratory affection (α = .85), which suggest a high reliability across subscales. Participants responded to items such as whether their grandmother told them that she loved them, missed them, asked them how they were doing, asked about their life, and told them stories about her life. Items ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), with higher values indicating higher degree of received affection. Specific items used in this study are listed in the Additional file 1.

Health behaviors were examined using a 53-item Health Practices Scale [50], which is a 7-point Likert scale (e.g., 1 = almost never; 7 = almost always) based on based on the frequency of health behaviors. This scale was validated by Jackson (2006) and the internal reliability of the subscales included diet (α = .92), exercise (α = .92), substance abuse (α = .89), and sleep (α = .89). In the present study, subscales included diet, exercise, substance abuse, and sleep to assess grandchildren’s overall health behaviors (See Additional file 1).

A 21-subscale in the Health Practices Scale was used to assess eating behaviors. Sample items included, “limit amount of fat in diet,” “limit sugar intake,” and “eat healthy foods” [50]. Participants indicated the frequency level of how often they performed a set of dietary behaviors, from 1 (almost never) to 7 (almost always). The alpha reliability of this scale was .92 using SPSS’s Cronbach’s alpha reliability test, which indicated high internal reliability.

An 11-item subscale in the Health Practices Scale was used to assess exercise behaviors. Sample items included, “do exercises that are good for you,” “go for regular walks,” and “make sure you are physically active” [50]. Participants indicated the frequency level of how often they performed a set of exercise behaviors, from 1 (almost never) to 7 (almost always). The alpha reliability of this scale was .94 using SPSS’s Cronbach’s alpha reliability test, which indicated high internal reliability.

An 11-item subscale in the Health Practices Scale was used to assess substance abuse behaviors [50]. Sample items included, “smoke cigarettes daily,” “use recreational drugs to relax,” and “drink alcohol until intoxicated.” Participants indicated the frequency level of how often they performed a set of substance abuse behaviors, from 1 (almost never) to 7 (almost always). The alpha reliability of this scale was .87 using SPSS’s Cronbach’s alpha reliability test, which indicated high internal reliability.

A 4-item subscale in the Health Practices Scale was used to assess individual’s sleep behaviors [50]. Sample items included, “sleep 7-8 hours per night” and “get adequate sleep every day.” Participants indicated the frequency level of how often they performed a set of substance sleep behaviors, from 1 (almost never) to 7 (almost always). The alpha reliability of this scale was .80 using SPSS’s Cronbach’s alpha reliability test, which indicated high internal reliability.

A correlation analysis was performed among the variables of this study to obtain the Pearson Product moment correlation coefficients of this study. Correlations for all of the variables were examined to determine strong relationships and high internal reliability across instruments used in this study (see Table 1).

The following assumptions were checked to ensure that the regression assumptions were met. First, there was evidence of a linear relationship between the independent variables (received affection) and health outcome variables. Second, the residuals were normally distributed, which demonstrated the normality assumption. Third, the scatterplots were spread for best line fit, which fulfilled the homoscedasticity assumption. Fourth, the observations were independent.

Fifth, this study tested for multicollinearity. The tolerance statistics (TS) and variance inflation factor (VIF) were examined in the regression analyses to uncover any possible multicollinearity issues among the independent variables. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was used to determine if the variance of the estimated regression coefficient was inflated due to collinearity among the independent variables or predictors of the regression models. The lowest tolerance statistic was .25 for received grandmother affection (love and esteem) and the highest VIF was 1.11 for received grandmother affection (celebratory), which showed that multicollinearity was not a main concern in this study given Mertler and Vannatta’s (2002) recommendations that VIF values should be under 2.5 [68]. The tolerance statistic was obtained using IBM SPSS 23.0, which regressed independent variables in the regression equations (received affection variables). The following equation was used to calculate the VIF of the variance of each of the regression models.

The VIF values of the four regression models including each of the independent variables with each health outcome included: dietary behaviors (VIF = 1.08, R2 = .07), exercise behaviors (VIF = 1.11, R2 = .10), substance abuse (VIF = 1.02, R2 = .02), and sleep behaviors (VIF = 1.06, R2 = .06).

Four multiple regression models are specified in the analysis of this study. Each of the models has the following independent variables entered into the regression block in each of the regression equations: love and esteem (X1), caring (X2), memories and humor (X3), and celebratory affection (X4). The βo is the intercept and the βi is the slope for each independent variable. The first model testing the first hypothesis will examine received grandmother affection on diet behavior (Y).

The second model testing the second hypothesis will examine received grandmother affection on exercise behavior (Y).

The third model testing the third hypothesis will examine received grandmother affection on diet behavior (Y).

The fourth model testing the last hypothesis will examine received grandmother affection on diet behavior (Y).

The decision criteria for the correlation, coefficient of determination, and regression slope of significance in this study included: p < .05. If the p-value was below .05, this was an indicator of statistical significance. However, if the p-value was above this criteria, this would indicate nonsignificant findings. In the regression models, the F statistic value was also used as a measure of overall fit, which indicated the probability that the models cannot be rejected. Additionally, the mean squared error values were also used to support the regression line assumption. Lastly, the estimation of statistical uncertainty was captured by the standard error of the regression model parameters using residual plots and regression diagnostics, which indicated that the regression models were reasonable.

All statistical analyses were executed using IBM SPSS 23.0. Hierarchical multiple regression models were used to assess the four hypotheses in this study. The first regression model examined whether received affection from grandmothers was related to grandchildren’s dietary behaviors (H1). The second regression model examined whether received affection from grandmothers was related to grandchildren’s exercise behaviors (H2). The third regression model examined whether received affection from grandmothers was related to grandchildren’s substance abuse behaviors (H3). And, the final regression model examined whether received affection from grandmothers was related to grandchildren’s sleep habit behaviors (H4).

Summaries of the multiple regression findings are in Table 2. Hypothesis one posed that received affection (i.e., love and esteem, caring, memories and humor, and celebratory) from grandmothers would be positively related to grandchildren’s reports of their dietary behaviors. The results of a multiple regression analysis revealed a significant model [R2 = .07, F(4, 200) = 3.77, p < .01]. Grandchildren’s reports of received memories and humor (β = .20, t = 2.01, p < .05, pr2 = .14), and celebratory (β = .20, t = 2.49, p < .05, pr2 = .17) affection from their grandparents was associated to grandchildren’s reports of their dietary behaviors. However, grandchildren’s reports of received love and esteem (β = −.24, t = −1.80, p = .06, ns), and caring (β = .11, t = .84, p = .09, ns) was not associated to grandchildren’s reports of their dietary behaviors. Therefore, this hypothesis was partially supported.

Hypotheses two predicted that received affection (i.e., love and esteem, caring, memories and humor, and celebratory) from grandmothers would be positively related to grandchildren’s reports of their exercise behaviors. The results of a multiple regression analysis revealed a significant model [R2 = .10, F(4, 212) = 5.92, p < .001]. Grandchildren’s reports of received love and esteem (β = −.26, t = −2.04, p < .05, pr2 = −.14), memories and humor (β = .25, t = 2.65, p < .01, pr2 = .18), and celebratory (β = .18, t = 2.26, p < .05, pr2 = .15) affection from their grandmothers was associated to grandchildren’s exercise behaviors. However, grandchildren’s reports of received caring (β = .17, t = 1.35, p = .08, pr2 = .09, ns) affection from their grandmothers was not associated to grandchildren’s exercise behaviors. Thus, this hypothesis was partially supported.

Hypotheses three predicted that received affection (i.e., love and esteem, caring, memories and humor, and celebratory) from grandmothers would be inversely related to grandchildren’s reports of their substance abuse behaviors. The results of a multiple regression analysis revealed a nonsignificant [R2 = .02, F(4, 213) = 1.29, p > .05, ns]. Grandchildren’s reports of received love and esteem (p = .08, ns), caring (p = .10, ns), memories and humor (p = .14, ns), and celebratory (p = .23, ns) affection from their grandmothers was not associated to grandchildren’s substance abuse behaviors. Thus, this hypothesis was not supported.

Hypothesis four predicted that received affection (i.e., love and esteem, caring, memories and humor, and celebratory) from grandmothers would be positively related to grandchildren’s reports of their sleep habit behaviors. The results of a multiple regression analysis revealed a significant model [R2 = .06, F(4, 218) = 3.75, p < .01]. Grandchildren’s reports of received love and esteem (β = .26, t = 3.43, p < .05, pr2 = .14) affection from their grandmothers was associated to grandchildren’s sleep habit behaviors. However, grandchildren’s reports of received caring (β = −.19, t = −1.58, p = .12, ns), memories and humor (β = .13, t = 1.32, p = .20, ns), and celebratory (β = .04, t = .53, p = .52, ns) affection from their grandmothers was not related to grandchildren’s sleep habit behaviors. Thus, this hypothesis was partially supported.

Affection exchange theory (AET) provided a framework to be able to address this study’s aim of explaining the link between adult grandchildren’s reports of their grandmothers’ affection on their individual health. This study contributes to prior research by examining AET using grandchildren’s received affection along with their health perceptions. In this study, the first hypothesis was partially supported because memories and humor and celebratory affection related with grandchildren’s dietary behaviors; however, love and esteem, and caring were not related with these behaviors. The second hypothesis was partially supported because love and esteem, memories and humor, and celebratory affection related to grandchildren’s exercise behaviors; however received caring was not shown to be related. The third hypothesis indicated that received affection did not relate with grandchildren’s substance abuse behaviors. The last hypothesis was partially supported because love and esteem related to grandchildren’s sleep habit behaviors, but other affection factors did not relate to this behavior.

Receiving grandmothers’ affection was partially linked to grandchildren’s reports of their dietary behaviors. More specifically, grandchildren’s reports of received memories and humor, and celebratory affection from grandparents was a predictor for dietary behaviors. Affection Exchange Theory postulated that the expression of affection can serve to promote genetic fitness [39]. By college students establishing healthy dietary behaviors, they in turn, advance their overall well-being, and their likelihood of procreation and longevity [69]. Mansson’s (2013) study demonstrated that grandparent affection did correlate with college students’ mental health, which can promote their healthy decision-making process [7]. Further, Floyd (2014) demonstrated that the lack of affection has been correlated with negative health outcomes (i.e., stress, depression) [10]. Studies by Weisbuch et al. (2011) and Stroberg and Humphrey (1987) have also shown that the emotional bonds established in relationships can impact abnormal eating behavior patterns in adults [70, 71]. Past studies have found that grandparents play a role in the healthy food intake of grandchildren including fruit and vegetables [61, 62]. The dietary intake of grandchildren and their food choices during early grandparent caregiving years may influence young adult grandchildren’s dietary habits [72]. A study found that grandparents prioritize feeding their grandchildren healthy foods and treats, which set the development of healthy eating behavioral patterns and food preferences, which may influence college students’ future dietary choices [73]. College students who interact in social relationships such as family relationships have also been showed to be related to sustaining a healthy diet [74]. However, the present study differs from these prior studies by examining the grandmother-grandchild relationship in relation to healthy dietary behaviors among college students. In particular, the present study extends prior work by demonstrating a link between grandchildren’s received grandmother affection and their grandchildren’s healthy dietary behaviors. However, there is still a need to further explore this finding longitudinally in future studies.

This study also showed that grandchildren’s received love and esteem, and caring were not predictors of college students’ dietary behaviors. One reason for this finding might be because positive affect alone might not include discussions about college students’ dietary needs. If a college student feels loved and cared for, this factor alone may not carry enough predictor weight to influence grandchildren’s healthy dietary behaviors. Perhaps there are other factors that come into play such as college stress and the mental health, which may also affect college students’ dietary behaviors [75]. Future studies may need to continue to examine the correlations between affection and college students’ dietary habits to gain further insight into this study’s findings.

Grandchildren’s reports of received love and esteem, memories and humor, and celebratory affection from grandmothers were predictors of grandchildren’s exercise behaviors. Affection exchange theory would suggest that affection can serve as a drive to maintain the emotional bond in the grandparent-grandchild relationship, which can promote the genetic fitness across generations [19, 39]. Prior cross-sectional family studies have investigated the link between family members (i.e., grandparents, parents) emotional and social support, and the physical activity of adolescents [76,77,78]. For instance, Xie et al. (2018) found that direct social support from Latino grandparents led to doing physical activities with grandchildren, asking grandchildren to do physical activities, and rewarding grandchildren for doing physical activities [76]. Intergenerational relationships such as the grandparent-grandchild relationship are also shown to be strengthened by the physical activity influence of grandparents on their young adult grandchildren [77]. In a parent and peer context, Haidar et al. (2019) found that receiving parental and peer social support was positively associated with healthier physical activity among adolescents [78]. However, what was missing from these studies was the investigation of the affectionate aspect in the grandmother-grandchild relationship in relation to grandchildren’s exercise behavior. This study extends prior work by finding that received affection from a grandmother may positively, yet indirectly influence college students’ exercise habits. Interestingly, grandchildren’s reports of received caring affection not associated with grandchildren’s exercise behaviors. This might be because the demonstration for caring may not depend on whether a grandchild exercises, or not. More research needs to explore the role of affection in mediating grandchildren’s’ exercise behaviors, to determine the role grandmothers play in the physical activity process of young adults.

Interestingly, substance abuse behaviors was not related to grandmothers’ affection toward their grandchildren. Lange and Greif (2011) found that grandmothers are known to provide care for children with mothers with substance use disorders, and these adolescents are at a high-risk for engaging in substance abuse as they reach adulthood [65]. However, the present study did not find any link between the expression of grandmothers’ affection and their grandchildren’s substance abuse. One reason may be that affection cannot necessarily predict substance abuse behavior that can occur due to other factors. For instance, previous studies have shown that family’s history (i.e., parents) of substance abuse is correlated with young adult’s substance use [79, 80]. On the other hand, Caday (2017) found that the lacked of received affection and attention from family members among young adults are some of the reasons why young adults become dependent on substance abuse during their college years [81]. Thus, even though this study did not find a link between grandmothers’ affection and their grandchildren’s’ substance abuse behavior, this is still a worthy area for further investigation in family communication.

This study also found that grandmother’s expression of love and esteem affection was associated with their grandchildren’s sleep habit behaviors. This supports a study that suggests that emotional bonding in relationships can affect sleep as a health related behavior [82]. It has previously been shown that social support and integration can be correlated with undergraduate college student’s sleep status [83]. Grandchildren who both receive affection and sleep adequately, may be at a higher advantage in their overall school performance as well [84]. Those that suffering sleep problems and who lack emotional connection with a loved family member (i.e., grandmother), can suffer from stress and pressure [85].

On the other hand, grandparents’ caring, memories and humor, and celebratory affection was not related to grandchildren’s sleep habit behaviors. This suggests that different types of affection will not necessarily make an impact on whether young adult grandchildren will obtain better quality sleep at night. This might be due to the convenience sample that was used was college students, which are commonly known to suffer from lack of sleep due sleep disturbances such as and other academic pressures [86]. Another reason might be that affection might not be a strong predictor of sleep quality in the grandparent-grandchild relationship context. However, perhaps exploring affection in other relationship contexts such as romantic relationship, this correlation may be more apparent.

The current study presented strengths that should be discussed. First, this study used the affection exchange theory to discover the link between adult grandchildren’s reports of received grandmother affection and their own report of health behavior. To date, there has been little research conducted to find the link in perceived affection from grandparents to specific health behaviors such as diet, exercise, no substance abuse, and sleep habit behaviors. Second, the sample demonstrated ethnic diversity, which may be representative to a diverse population. Third, the correlational and regression methodology employed was effective in testing the hypotheses using a moderate sample size.

While the study had several strengths, this study also had several limitations that will be discussed along with ideas for future directions. First, this study relied on self-report surveys that were conducted online via the use of Qualtrics and it asked students to recall their grandmothers’ affectionate communication behavior. While self-report surveys are generally acceptable to use, there are other possible methods that could be explored to overcome the limitations of recalling information or the use of deception in self-report surveys. For example, future studies can use a variety of different methods to explore different variables to measure affection differently. For instance, future observational studies may audio record and/or video record grandmothers providing affection to their grandchildren and then have grandchildren assess whether grandchildren actually perceive this behavior as affectionate communicative behavior. Second, this study only relied on the perceptions of the grandchildren. A future study may continue this line of research using dyadic data analysis between grandchildren and their grandmothers, and grandchildren’s behavioral health factors. Third, this study focused only on grandmothers. Future studies can focus on grandfathers and their grandchildren to determine if grandfathers’ affection will correlate with their grandchildren’s health behaviors. Fourth, this study used a convenient sample of college students who had an existing grandmother-grandchild relationship given the study’s focus on college-aged grandchildren. However, future studies can use different sampling designs such as systematic sampling using a larger sample to study different aged grandchildren to determine if grandmothers’ affection affect their grandchildren in elementary, middle school, or high school. Lastly, this study did not examine additional relational factors such as the length and quality of the affectionate relationship. Future researchers may examine how these relational factors influence grandchildren’s health outcomes.

To conclude, the aim of this study was to examine the influence of received grandmother affection on their grandchildren’s health behaviors such as their a) diet, b) exercise, c) substance abuse, and d) sleep. In terms of health outcomes, this study showed that received memories and humor, and celebratory affection was influential to grandchildren’s reports of dietary behaviors. Also, received love and esteem, memories and humor, and celebratory affection was associated with grandchildren’s exercise behaviors. However, none of the grandparent affection factors were found to have relationship with grandchildren’s substance abuse behaviors. In terms, of sleep, only love and esteem impacted grandchildren’s sleep habit behaviors. Thus, this study overall highlights the importance of examining affection exchange theory’s variables for affection and the predictors in terms of promoting emotional bonds among grandmothers and their children, and this study demonstrated that receiving affection from grandmothers may partially impact the health outcomes of young adult grandchildren.

# A Popular—And Misunderstood—Theory of Relationships - The Atlantic

We’re using the concept of “attachment styles” all wrong.

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Like astrology signs and the Enneagram, the psychological framework of attachment theory has become a popular blueprint for understanding the self. But as my colleague Faith Hill wrote last weekend in The Atlantic, the four attachment “types” aren’t as cut-and-dried as they may seem. In fact, the whole theory is widely misunderstood.

First, here are three new stories from The Atlantic.

Anxiously Attached

In the 1950s, the psychologist John Bowlby coined the term attachment to refer to the bond formed between an infant and its caregiver. He argued that this formative connection would go on to shape how an infant related to and bonded with other people for the rest of its life. His theory eventually led to the establishment of three different attachment “styles”: securely attached (describing people who are generally open and trusting); anxiously attached (describing people who “long for closeness but are paranoid that others will hurt them, and are thus preoccupied with validation,” as Faith puts it in her story); avoidantly attached (describing those who, “driven by the same fear of abandonment, keep others at arm’s length”); and disorganized, an honorary fourth type which combines anxious and avoidant traits and is a more recent addition to the taxonomy.

Attachment theory was once the provenance of Psychology 101 lectures and perhaps also the psychotherapist’s couch. But today, the framework’s tidy behavioral-identity labels make it a natural candidate for online virality. Attachment theory has crossed the threshold into Gen Z memedom: In a Vox article published earlier this week, the writer Allie Volpe cited an attachment-theory TikTok that’s been viewed nearly 6 million times. That 37-second clip depicts a woman’s descent through a cascade of imagined worst-case scenarios after she wakes up to find that her boyfriend hasn’t texted good morning—“what dating someone with an anxious attachment style can look like,” the text above her head reads. If the video’s more than 3,600 viewer comments are any indication, the sketch strikes a chord.

This new popularity has brought with it a serious misconception about the framework: Many people seem to believe “that one’s style is set in stone during childhood, determined by connections with early caregivers, and doomed to play out in every relationship thereafter,” Faith writes. But the reality is much more complex.

In 2021, The New York Times attributed attachment theory’s renewed spotlight to the 2010 self-help book Attached: The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find—And Keep—Love. (Anecdotally, I can vouch for this book as the catalyst for at least one of my fellow elder-Millennial friends’ recent, enthusiastic preoccupation with the three main types.) But even the book’s authors are inclined to position attachment as more of a fluid tendency than a hard-set trait—as Faith explains, a “working model” that you’re constantly updating:

Amir Levine, a neuroscientist, Columbia University psychiatrist, and co-author of Attached, told me you can think of an attachment orientation as a working model of the world: a set of beliefs that are constantly put to the test. Those beliefs stem largely from the interactions you’ve already had—but your subsequent interactions keep shaping your expectations, which means that your working model can keep evolving.

In an excerpt, published in The Atlantic, from her 2022 book, Platonic: How the Science of Attachment Can Help You Make—And Keep—Friends, the psychologist Marisa G. Franco elaborated on how our attachment styles can change based on each new relationship that comes into our lives:

We develop our attachment styles based in part on our early relationships with our caregivers … But attachment isn’t all our parents’ fault. Although early experiences with caregivers establish expectations about how we’ll be treated, these expectations likely evolve in other relationships. And they shape those relationships in turn.

None of this is to say that our formative relationships don’t stay with us. Some negative experiences, unfortunately, may stick with us forever. But as Faith points out, they aren’t determinative of our ability to form new connections. She writes, “You’ll likely meet people you can count on, and hopefully you’ll start to believe that you can count on yourself too.”

Math Is Magic

By Camonghne Felix

In second grade, I stopped being able to do math. One night I went to do my long-division homework and I couldn’t figure it out. My mom demanded that I sit with my math teacher because my sudden inability made no sense. Two weeks later, I was sent home with a disciplinary note for turning in only empty or incorrect homework and was accused of not paying attention in class.

Up until then I had been a “good” student, a “smart” girl. I remember the secret bliss I felt when I knew before my peers how to count fractions without the help of manipulatives, and how to subtract negatives. This can be only partially explained by the teaching I got in school. My mom, who was then studying computer science and psychology in her master’s program, was determined to instill a love of learning in my life. Over the course of a year, she built me a computer out of parts and installed all kinds of educational games on it. When I arrived home every day, I attended my mother’s academy, where I spent most of my afternoons watching the sun fall on the walls of my bedroom as I finger-punched my way through the programs.

P.S.

While preparing to write today’s Daily edition, I came across an incredible find in the Atlantic archive: a 14,600-word feature, from the February 1990 issue of the magazine, on the origins and evolution of attachment theory. The article includes interviews with then-83-year-old Bowlby and his contemporary, the American Canadian psychologist Mary Ainsworth (who is widely credited with developing the three primary attachment styles), both long since deceased. It’s an exemplar of old-fashioned (in a good way) long-form magazine journalism, and a fascinating snapshot of human inquiry and understanding.

The 5 conditions for secure attachment


 


Published on January 5, 2021
Updated on June 9, 2024 

Attachment theory: not only is it fascinating to read, but it also gives us hope that we will get to understand ourselves at least a little bit better. Since everyone has relationship issues – be it with our partners, family, or friends – we are very likely to relate to John Bowlby’s attachment theory.

Once we discover it, we get excited and assume that our attachment styles will explain all about why we are how we are, why we do what we do, and why we face certain challenges in social situations.

Even though attachment theory can, to a large extent, explain our behavioral patterns – especially in intimate relationships – we have to be careful how we interpret it and how we apply it. This article is meant to give you a heads-up about the most common traps you might fall into when you first discover attachment theory and the four attachment styles.

If you’re already familiar with Bowlby’s work, feel free to use this post to check whether you’re on the right track. You can also take a step back and reflect on whether you fell into any of these traps in the past.

First off, everyone has problems in their relationships. Nobody is perfect. Nobody’s life circumstances are perfect either. There comes a point in every relationship when you fight with your partner. There’ll be times when you feel misunderstood, under-appreciated, frustrated, or unhappy.

But that doesn’t necessarily mean that you have an attachment disorder or an attachment issue. Approximately one in every three people is insecurely attached. Don’t jump straight to the assumption that you are that one person.

Remember that no relationship is perfect. Experiencing problems with or within relationships does not necessarily mean that you have an attachment problem.

Now, even if you do have some mild attachment issues, don’t rush into blaming your parents. Keep in mind that attachment styles are created in the first year and a half of your life. If you’re looking back on your childhood trying to figure out how your parents neglected or rejected you when you were a toddler, you’re not going to get what you’re searching for.

It’s wrong to say that parents are bad or guilty. Parents want the best for their children. And they do what they can do. The child’s attachment style is not about the mom or the dad, but rather about the quality of their relationships with the child. And the quality of these relationships is based on what the parents are giving and, more importantly, on whether the child feels what the parent is giving.

Another important factor to consider is that, if your mom or dad were anxious or dismissive, you’re likely to have picked up on that. Poodles make poodles, right? So, it might be a learned behavior, which – on the bright side – can be unlearned.

Having a tendency to be preoccupied or dismissive doesn’t necessarily mean that your parents didn’t take good care of you, and that your childhood was bad.

Attachment styles are dimensional, especially when it comes to preoccupied and dismissive attachment. Let’s look at how an attachment specialist would rate your attachment style.

Hold one of your hands up and straighten your fingers. Now, this hand represents the zone of secure attachment. Your middle finger indicates the absolute level of secure attachment: no traits of preoccupied or dismissive attachment in that category.

If you move in the directions of your pinkie and your thumb, you move away from secure attachment, but you’re still in the secure zone. This means that you can have preoccupied or dismissive traits and still be securely attached.

If we add three more fingers on each side of the secure zone hand, we enter the two insecure styles: preoccupied and dismissive. There are still different levels of severity for each insecure style.

What we are trying to show you here is that, when it comes to preoccupied and dismissive attachment, you don’t just have it or not have it. You can be a bit preoccupied. You can be a bit dismissive. You can be securely attached and still have some traits of these insecure styles.

It’s not all or nothing. You might have noticed that, even though it’s in the picture, we didn’t mention disorganized attachment. Later in this post, you’ll understand why.

It’s essential to understand that attachment is pre-cognitive: it’s set before a child is able to think. It’s a felt sense. Anything after three years of age is cognitive, or thought-based. Anything before that is what you feel inside.

A person who is highly preoccupied or dismissive would act on the basis of feelings that they don’t even know they have.

So, if your anxiety – which you anticipate to be preoccupied attachment – is based on a flow of thoughts, rather than on a sensation you are not able to explain or understand, then it’s likely that you don’t have a preoccupied attachment style. There might be other factors – like Early Maladaptive Schemas, for example – that account for the anxiety you exhibit.

At first, it might seem like the whole point of attachment theory is to group people in four categories – one for each attachment style. This, of course, is far from true. Keep in mind that the classification of attachment styles was created in a clinical, therapeutic setting. Outside the lab, and when it comes to treatment, the goal of therapy is not to give people labels.

The goal is to identify the cluster of behaviors that need to be worked on. And it doesn’t really matter how you call it: you’d still have to work on whatever is going on

A style is, after all, just a style. You can think of your attachment style as you think of your zodiac sign. Both have certain characteristics, but that doesn’t mean that you need to have all of them. Capricorn is not a label, just like dismissive attachment is not a label.  

It’s crucial to also understand that attachment work is not a negative; it’s a positive. There are positive characteristics about being dismissive or preoccupied. Those positive characteristics, though, can sometimes get in your way and start being problematic.

Someone with preoccupied attachment, for example, is very caring and nurturing; and these are positive qualities. An issue may arise, however, if they are too much of that: they might go as far as to forget about themselves.

You can think of the characteristics of insecure attachment as the extremes of positive qualities, instead of as negative qualities.

If you’re looking through the typical characteristics of anxious / preoccupied and avoidant / dismissive attachment, you might find that some aspects of both fit you pretty well. So, what do you do? You think, “Oh, I must have a disorganized attachment style because it’s sort of a mixture of preoccupied and dismissive traits.”

But chances are that you don’t have a disorganized attachment style. Disorganized attachment is a combination of the preoccupied and dismissive styles. Indeed, people who have disorganized attachment exhibit characteristics of both styles – like warring, conflictual strategies. The consequence is that they have very poor relationships.

Someone who has disorganized attachment has a higher chance of being involved with the law, courts, and institutional settings. They don’t sit around wondering if they are preoccupied or dismissive. They’re not going to be interested in figuring themselves out, because they blame everybody else.

Disorganized attachment can be a serious issue that requires therapeutic treatment. It’s not likely that you’ve had this type of disturbance all along and that you and the people around you haven’t noticed it.

Remember that in point four we talked about dimensionality. Now, when it comes to disorganized attachment, there is no dimensionality. You can’t really be “a bit disorganized, but mostly secure,” unless you’ve been through some serious trauma, such as war, rape, etc.

A common issue among medical students, or psychology students, is that, once they learn about a disease or disorder, they tend to freak out that they have it. They try to find a way to self-identify with it. The same goes for attachment disturbances.

Be careful with self-diagnosing your attachment style. Don’t jump to conclusions too quickly.

Keep in mind that attachment specialists spend years learning how to conduct and score an attachment interview. They’re not going to give you a quiz like the ones you see in Cosmopolitan magazines. It really takes an expert in the field to assess your attachment style accurately.

It’s good to learn about attachment styles and their characteristics. It’s good to reflect on your relationship experiences. It’s also completely fine to take an attachment quiz and assume that you have a certain tendency (of anxiety or avoidance). But the important thing is to not rely on that self-diagnosis too much.

This comes as a “part two” of the previous point. Just because you’ve read a lot and believe you get the theory pretty well doesn’t mean that you can (and should) make assumptions about the attachment styles of everyone around you. It might be tempting, sure. And it’s absolutely fine to wonder about it, or to even analyze others in your head.

Just don’t expect to always be right. And please, don’t go around telling people that they have a problem. That’s just not cool. Instead, make the best out of your knowledge. Share what you’ve learned with someone who might need to hear it. If needed, encourage them to get acquainted with the topic or to see a therapist.

Last but not least, it’s important to have realistic expectations when it comes to healing attachment issues. Keep in mind that most online sources on the topic are offering knowledge, not treatment.

It’s unrealistic to think that you would figure things out and heal an insecure attachment style just by reading books or articles, or by watching YouTube videos.

The truth is that you can’t substitute treatment for knowledge. 

There’s no quick fix when it comes to healing insecure attachment. And if you really want to change, you need to commit to that.

On the bright side, anxious / preoccupied and avoidant / dismissive attachment are believed to be relatively easy to treat, according to attachment specialists.

Attachment theory is not as easy as it seems. It’s not straightforward. Yet, it offers incredible insight into human development. But it’s essential to use this insight carefully.

# You Can Change Your Attachment Style - The Atlantic

Our past experiences do shape our relationships. But we’re not doomed to repeat unhealthy patterns forever.

The panic set in at the same point every semester: Whenever Ximena Arriaga, a psychology professor at Purdue University, got to attachment theory in her course on close relationships, the classroom grew tense. When she described how people who are anxiously attached can sometimes be demanding and vigilant—and that can drive their partners away—certain students looked disturbed. “I could just see in their face: I’m so screwed,” Arriaga told me. When she explained how avoidantly attached people might feel overwhelmed by emotional intimacy, other students seemed so uncomfortable that they physically shrank back. Some would approach her after class and ask: “Is there any hope for me?”

These students were likely misinterpreting attachment theory in a way that experts told me they see all the time. The theory posits that there are three main attachment styles: securely attached people are trusting, and believe that others are generally worthy of trust; anxiously attached people long for closeness but are paranoid that others will hurt them, and are thus preoccupied with validation; avoidantly attached people, driven by the same fear of abandonment, keep others at arm’s length. (More recently, some researchers have argued there is a fourth style: “disorganized,” a combination of anxious and avoidant.) The common misconception is that one’s style is set in stone during childhood, determined by connections with early caregivers, and doomed to play out in every relationship thereafter.

The reality of the theory is more complex than that. Your attachment style is not so much a fixed category you fall into, like an astrology sign, but rather a tendency that can vary among different relationships and, in turn, is continuously shaped by those relationships. Perhaps most important, you can take steps to change it. So Arriaga could give her concerned students good news: Attachment style isn’t destiny.

Read: I gave myself three months to change my personality

You can’t really blame people for misunderstanding attachment theory, given how significantly it’s evolved since its conception. In the 1950s, the psychologist John Bowlby proposed the term attachment to describe the bond between infants and their mothers (fathers weren’t considered particularly relevant at the time). His big idea—that the quality of a mother’s care would essentially predict her infant’s future well-being—built on another famous line of research that started the same decade: Harry Harlow’s monkey studies.

In a series of experiments, Harlow, a University of Wisconsin psychologist, separated baby rhesus monkeys from their mothers and placed them in cages. In one study, each monkey was alone with two “surrogate mothers”: one made of wire, which dispensed milk, and the other made of terry cloth, which did not. The monkeys overwhelmingly preferred the milkless but softer cloth monkey, cuddling up to it and running to it when frightened. In another study, when the baby rhesuses were deprived of any mother at all—real or fake—they seemed to lose their ability to socialize. Some stopped eating and eventually died. The ethics were dubious, but the takeaway was considered monumental: Children depend on their mothers not just for nourishment but for comfort—for an emotional bond seemingly so crucial that it was almost magical. Bowlby called that bond “attachment,” and he believed that it formed a blueprint for all subsequent relationships. The effects of a mother’s nurturing—or the consequences of her failures—were forever.

But Harlow’s later research complicated that idea. When he put baby monkeys together—still with no surrogate or real mother—they fared much better than when they were in total isolation. And even those who’d been completely isolated for the first six months of life “achieved essentially complete social recovery” when placed with other monkeys. Michael Lewis, who directs the Institute for the Study of Child Development at Rutgers University’s medical school, told me that researchers have realized something similar about human attachment: a mother-infant bond, or lack thereof, doesn’t solely determine the health of the child’s future relationships. Children are influenced by not just their parents but a whole world of other connections: peers, siblings, grandparents, neighbors, teachers. And early experiences aren’t the only ones that are important. Researchers have found little correlation between childhood and adult attachment styles.

How much alone time do kids need?

That doesn’t mean that attachment theory is bunk. Adults really do tend toward an attachment style—but it’s multiply determined, which means that if you had a difficult childhood, you’re not doomed. And although early theorists conceived of distinct attachment-style groups, researchers have since found that people fall not into an attachment bucket, but rather along a spectrum. Most people aren’t too far apart on it. William Chopik, a psychologist at Michigan State University, put it this way: “Maybe you’re a little bit more avoidant than me, or you’re more secure than your other friends. There is a sense in which we’re differing by, like, decimal points.”

Some researchers have started referring to attachment “orientation,” rather than “style,” seemingly to avoid implying that it’s a static personality trait. Amir Levine, a neuroscientist, Columbia University psychiatrist, and co-author of Attached, told me you can think of an attachment orientation as a working model of the world: a set of beliefs that are constantly put to the test. Those beliefs stem largely from the interactions you’ve already had—but your subsequent interactions keep shaping your expectations, which means that your working model can keep evolving.

In fact, it’s likely to. On average, people tend to grow toward security as they get older. That might be because we accumulate more evidence that the people in our lives aren’t going anywhere. “When you’re married to someone for 40 years,” Chopik told me, “hopefully you stop freaking out about whether or not they’re going to be there the next day.” There’s also a “natural mellowing out that happens with age”—people tend to get better at social interactions, and more comfortable in their own skin.

Attachment style doesn’t just change over the arc of your life. It can also vary from moment to moment (people tend toward insecurity when they’re stressed) and across different relationships. Marisa Franco, a University of Maryland psychologist and the author of Platonic: How the Science of Attachment Can Help You Make—And Keep—Friends, told me that it’s not uncommon, for instance, to have a more secure attachment with a partner than with friends. Unlike a romantic relationship, which might follow a more predictable structure—meeting, moving in together, perhaps getting married—and typically involves a more formal commitment, friendships can be full of ambiguity, which can lead us to fall back on old working models. Within a relationship category, too, your attachment style can differ; you might have a secure relationship with one warm, reassuring friend, and a less secure one with someone distant and flaky.

Read: The trait that ‘super friends’ have in common

For that reason, several researchers told me, if you want to work toward security, you might need to change who you’re spending time with. People on the anxious side might flourish with someone who’s particularly reassuring and present; people on the avoidant side might need someone who can give them space while still being supportive.

But Arriaga offered a caveat: Her research has shown that although reassurance can help anxiously inclined people in the short term, relying on it isn’t always good for them. They can also benefit from pursuing a sense of self-efficacy—working on feeling more inherently worthy, and less dependent on others to tell them they are. In one study, for instance, she found that new parents who felt competent in their novel role displayed lasting increases in security. Other studies suggest that pursuing and succeeding in goals can do the same.

Attachment orientation is complex; it’s an ongoing interaction between the external world and your internal one, between your circumstances and your interpretation of them. Separating the two can be hard. For instance, when people struggle with anxious attachment, Franco pointed out, they’re apt to notice signs of rejection while overlooking signs of acceptance. But knowing that your working model might not match reality, that it can change, and wanting to change it does make a difference. One of Chopik’s studies found that just wanting to become more secure was associated with more actual change in that direction over a four-month period, compared with subjects who didn’t express a desire for change.

This is what Arriaga wanted to impart on her students: You may not pull yourself up from being the least to the most secure person in the class. You certainly can’t undo the experiences you’ve already had—the ones that might’ve led you to grasp too hard for connection or push it away. But you will have new experiences; you’ll likely meet people you can count on, and hopefully you’ll start to believe that you can count on yourself too. So when they ask her if there’s hope, her answer is: “Of course.”

These days, I see many social media posts & blogs talking about an “insecure-disorganised adult attachment style”. This is a myth! Let’s have a closer look.What IS disorganised attachment?Disorganised attachment is a classification derived from observations of child behaviour towards a caregiver – e.g., within the Strange Situation Procedure.Disorganised attachment behaviours in children indicate conflict (different opposing behavioural patterns like approach and avoidance), confusion and/or apprehension towards the caregiver when the child is distressed.Disorganised attachment behaviours in children also reflect a state of “fright without solution”. This can be caused by frightening or frightened, alarming or inexplicable caregiver behaviour in response to child distress, or by repeated / major child separations from the caregiver.Disorganised attachment behaviours in children furthermore reflect some degree of systematic disruption in their attachment system functioning. The child is no longer able to coherently direct their attention to either their caregiver (as in secure or insecure-anxious attachment) or the environment (as in insecure-avoidant attachment).What IS NOT disorganised attachment?Disorganised attachment is not another insecure attachment style, nor is it a more extreme form of an insecure-anxious or avoidant attachment style. Secure, insecure-avoidant and anxious attachment styles together belong to the organised attachment styles. Disorganised attachment is a category on its own.Also, disorganised attachment in children is not the same as a fearful(-avoidant) attachment style in adults. Fearful(-avoidant) attachment is derived from self-report questionnaires in the context of adult romantic relationships. It generally describes a co-occurrence of insecure-anxious and -avoidant attachment elements. There is no empirical evidence of associations between a fearful(-avoidant) attachment style in adult self-report questionnaires and disorganised attachment derived from behavioural observations in children.Thus, there is no such thing as an insecure-disorganised attachment style in adults!

Attachment is often described as “good” or “bad”, and as “weak” or “strong”. This is a myth! Let’s have a closer look.Attachment is our primary social survival strategy. We cannot survive and thrive without it. Attachment ensures our access to co-regulation or social allostasis. We therefore all must be attached to at least one and ideally several attachment figure(s) across the lifespan.Attachment theory, above all, asks about our attachment quality – how our attachment makes us feel and think within our relationships and whether it is useful and helpful in our everyday life. Just because some attachment patterns are labelled as insecure or disorganised does not make them bad or useless as such.Our current attachment patterns have emerged as meaningful, appropriate and necessary adaptations to specific environmental demands.If an attachment figure is consistently unavailable or insensitive, it is useful and helpful to develop avoidant tendencies that increase self-regulation in that relationship. In turn, if an attachment figure acts unpredictably but does sometimes offer vital care and protection, it is useful and helpful to develop anxious tendencies that increase our calls for support to be heard in that relationship.And if an attachment figure is threatening or neglectful, it still is useful and helpful to develop more extreme self-protection strategies associated with disorganisation in that relationship. As long as we have multiple different attachments so that we always feel sufficiently safe and taken care of. Of course, the above considerations by no means ignore the fact that certain attachments involve a high risk for physical and mental health and thus need to be dealt with immediately and professionally.Overall, rather than labelling or “diagnosing” attachment patterns in people, we should appreciate both the benefits and risks of secure, insecure and disorganised attachment. We should embrace a balanced and comprehensive behavioural, psychological, physiological and neurobiological (SoNeAt) approach. Only then, we can help everyone to thrive in whatever circumstances they may find themselves.Post on Instagram

Very often, dads are described as “substitute mums” or secondary attachment figures for their kids. This is a myth! Let’s have a closer look.It is true that attachment theory initially paid little attention to dads. While dads were seen as distant breadwinners and playmates, mums were regarded as kids’ primary attachment figures and child-mother attachment as most important for child development. But this was a long time ago and many things have changed since then. Nowadays, there is a lot of research on fathers from an attachment perspective, and attachment theory recognises dads as involved, capable and equal caregivers.Two recent meta-analyses highlight that mums and dads are equally important in raising children and setting them up for optimal development. Kids who had secure attachments to both parents had fewer anxiety and depression symptoms and showed better language skills (compared to kids with one or no secure attachment(s) within their intact, two-parent families). There was also no indication for a hierarchy of importance – i.e., which parent kids developed a secure attachment with. Kids with secure attachment only to mum or only to dad did not differ in their mental health and language competence outcomes.And although another meta-analysis on maternal and parental sensitivity describes some sex-differences, it emphasises that mums’ and dads’ parenting behaviours are more similar than may be expected, and that the impact of maternal and paternal sensitivity on child outcomes is similar, too. Moreover, new findings show that like in mums, attachment representations, reflective functioning and parental sensitivity are also linked in dads. Finally, we should be aware that the biological sex of the adult with whom children form a secure attachment is not that important. What matters most is the number of secure attachments children develop within the family network. Kids have also been shown to thrive when developing secure attachments in nontraditional families, like those with same-sex parents. The current discussion should thus not only focus on dads but on any non-birthing parents besides mums.Also check out my webpage on the social neuroscience of attachment and caregiving in fathers – Caring Dads.

The neurobiology of attachment is often explained based on the Triune Brain Model. But this model is a myth and its use misleading. Let’s have a closer look.The Triune Brain Model divides the human brain into three sections with separate functions: an innermost “reptile brain” for basic survival, a middle “mammalian brain” for emotions, memories and habits, and an outermost “human brain” for language, reasoning and cognitive control. Such an organisation allegedly reflects three successive stages of evolutionary development across species that enabled increasingly complex neural computations and corresponding behaviour. Recent neuroscience findings show that the Triune Brain Model is severely flawed. We now know that all vertebrates’ brains comprise the above-mentioned three brain structures, and that the human brain did not linearly evolve from a reptile brain. Thus, the human brain is not an “onion with a tiny reptile inside”. We also know that no brain structure has only one specific function and never works in complete isolation. Instead, our brain is made up of several extended and strongly interconnected neural networks whose activations and deactivations are always in a dynamic balance. Why are these considerations relevant for attachment? They are relevant because secure attachment is often linked with high functionality of a “human brain mode”, whereas insecure and disorganised attachment (and trauma) are associated with reverting to an inferior, inappropriate and maladaptive “reptile or mammalian brain mode”. But such a view is wrong. Individual differences in attachment can be seen across the entire human brain and equally relate to (positive and negative) emotion processing, cognitive control and mentalizing. Secure, insecure and disorganised attachment (and trauma) are reflected in different co-activation patterns across networks, in an adjustment of the dynamic balance – see our NAMA and NAMDA. And all such adjustments initially represent meaningful and adaptive responses to specific environmental demands. The human brain is adaptive, not triune – and this adaptiveness is key, especially for attachment!Post on Instagram

We often say: the more synchrony, the better for attachment. But this is a myth! Let’s have a closer look.Synchrony is defined as the coordination of bio-behavioural processes during and shortly after social contact. It unfolds in our behaviour (e.g., eye gaze, vocalisations, touch), physiology (e.g., heart rate), endocrinology (secretion of hormones like oxytocin or cortisol) and brain activity. Synchrony is particularly important for the parent-infant bond, where it shapes infants’ attachment through repeated and contingent interactions with their caregivers.  Social allostasis is emphasised as one of the key processes that links synchrony with attachment. During social allostasis, caregivers act as external co-regulators of infants’ physiology. For this to work efficiently and successfully, there needs to be a good bio-behavioural matching between parent and child, which reflects high parental sensitivity and attunement to the infant. Unsurprisingly, differences in social allostasis availability and quality predict infant emotional, cognitive and brain development, and likely explain how individual differences in attachment emerge and are neurobiologically embedded across the life span.Crucially, however, such evidence should not lead us to believe that more synchrony is always better. Particularly during co-regulatory parent-infant interactions as part of infants’ social allostasis, parental overstimulation, intrusiveness and inconsistency are known to predict insecure infant attachment outcomes. For synchrony to be beneficial, it needs to be appropriate and context-dependent and not always indiscriminately high. There thus is an “optimum midrange” of synchrony, with both too little and too much synchrony likely being linked to interaction, relationship and attachment difficulties. Accordingly, we recently found increased parent-child brain-to-brain synchrony not only for dyads with securely attached daughters but also for dyads with insecurely attached mothers. More research is needed to further elucidate the exact nature of bio-behavioural synchrony, particularly in relation to attachment.   Post on Instagram.

Oxytocin (OT) is often labelled the “bonding or love hormone”. Although OT undoubtedly plays an important role in love, sex, childbirth, bonding, attachment and caregiving, this is a myth. Let’s have a closer look!   The main problem with the “bonding or love hormone” account of OT’s function is an overemphasis on its prosocial and relationship-promoting effects, which goes back to a 2005 study in humans that reported increased trust after a single dose of OT given by nasal spray. However, many subsequent studies using a similar procedure were inconclusive and often failed to show the same results. What is more, many studies found OT to actually have negative effects. For example, OT nasal spray administration increased dishonesty/lying,  increased the inclination for aggression and made more anxiously attached participants remember their mother as less caring and close. How can we reconcile these opposite roles of OT for human social behaviour, and particularly bonding and attachment? A better way to conceptualise OT’s function is to think of it as regulating the saliency of many different cues – positive, negative, social, non-social – depending on a variety of contextual factors. For example, for social relationships, it is beneficial to show both prosocial behaviour towards one’s friends but more wary or even hostile behaviour towards strangers. This is also known as “tend-and-defend” behaviour.A related but slightly different view suggests that OT is importantly involved in “tend-and-befriend” behaviour, which enhances the desire for social contact particularly in response to stress. Very interestingly, such behaviour is more prominent in individuals with attachment anxiety (versus avoidance). Extending this view, a recent theory describes OT as an allostatic hormone that modulates both social and non-social behaviour by maintaining stability through changing environments and predicting future regulatory demands. This account overlaps nicely with our latest thoughts on the link between attachment, allostasis and energy conservation through co-regulation. When you read about OT the next time, try to keep these different accounts in mind.Post on Instagram.

Polyvagal Theory (PVT) is very prominent in the context of attachment and trauma. However, PVT is not supported by current physiology literature. This has important implications. Let’s have a closer look.PVT suggests that our autonomic nervous system does not only have two sympathetic and  parasympathetic branches, but that the latter further dissociates into a dorsal and a ventral vagal pathway. An “evolutionarily primitive” dorsal pathway putatively mediates massive heart rate slowing (bradycardia) during extreme threat-induced immobilisation when sympathetic fight-or-flight reactions are less adaptive. Conversely, an “advanced mammalian” ventral pathway allegedly modulates heart rate and self-calming, being enhanced during conditions of safety and positive social contact. Consequently, PVT implies that the emergence of a ventral pathway coincided with the evolution of “social mammals” from “asocial reptiles”, and that there is a hierarchy within the three autonomic nervous system branches. The above (and other) PVT claims are not supported by current physiology literature. There is no scientific evidence for a “dumb” versus a “smart” vagal pathway dichotomy in mammals, nor for bradycardia to be exclusively caused or significantly influenced by a dorsal pathway. What are the implications for attachment and trauma? We must appreciate that we don’t get “stuck” in certain “nervous system states” (e.g., in a sympathetic or dorsal vagal state as trauma survivors), and that there is no nervous system state (e.g., a ventral vagal state) that is always more ”desirable” or “human-like”. Such oversimplified explanations are unhelpful as they don’t tell the truth and unnecessarily label certain physiological responses and behaviours as either categorically good or bad.Attachment and trauma involve complex physiological responses and behaviours maintained by extended and interconnected neurobiological networks (not just the autonomic nervous system or particular branches of it). And these patterns always emerge as meaningful and adaptive responses to particular environmental demands. We need to embrace this complexity and acknowledge its true value.Post on Instagram

The internet is full of specific “parenting hacks” that promise to work for everybody and always lead to secure child attachment development. But this is a myth. Let’s have a closer look.It is well known and scientifically proven that a secure child-caregiver attachment is beneficial for child social, emotional and cognitive development. Many parents are therefore looking for ways of increasing their children’s attachment security. And this is, of course, a very good thing as such. The problem, however, is that many of the suggested attachment “parenting hacks” are not based on attachment theory and science. This means that although they often provide useful and helpful advice on how to raise children in general, there is no evidence that applying them will necessarily and specifically increase children’s attachment security. Furthermore, these “parenting hacks” often are strongly prescriptive – i.e., they instruct parents to do certain things like feeding, sleeping, etc., in a particular way. This can cause real harm, especially if things don’t work out as planned or desired.Well then, what does attachment theory and science say about secure child attachment development? The main message is that for secure child attachment development, the “how” is much more important than the “what”. There are countless ways for parents to interact with their children – each situation is different and each parent-child relationship unique. Something that works today may not work tomorrow, and something that works for one child may not work for another. And this is perfectly fine.But in all of these different situations and relationships, there are certain principles that – based on current attachment theory and science – are known to help parents foster secure child attachment development. We summarise them in our free-of-charge Babygro Book for Parents as CHATS (cues, history, attachment, talk, synchrony). Crucially, these principles are not intended to prescribe parenting advice. Much on the contrary, they intend to empower parents by bringing them trusted, evidence-based information that enables them to feel reassured and confident in their own and unique parenting choices.Post on Instagram

I often hear that attachment is “right-brain” centred and that there is a general “right-brain” versus “left-brain” dominance for complex behaviours and personality traits. But this is a myth! Let’s have a closer look.A widespread theory suggests that we are either “right-brained” or left-brained”. Right-brained people are supposedly more intuitive, emotional and creative, while left-brained people are more objective, logical and analytical. The theory originates from Nobel Prize winner Roger Sperry’s research on “split-brain” patients. It is, of course, true that different brain areas control different brain functions and that such roles are often lateralized. For example, the right motor cortex controls movement of the left side of the body. And in about 90% of people, there is left-brain dominance linked to right-handedness and language skills.Yet, such brain specialisation, lateralization and side dominance does not extend to complex behaviours and personality traits. In a large study of over 1000 participants dividing the brain into 7000 regions, no evidence of a general brain-sidedness was found. How is this related to attachment? Because attachment behaviour is often emotional and intuitive, many say that it is “right-brain” centred. Furthermore, when this view is combined with the Triune Brain Model (see Attachment Myth-Busting Post #4), particularly insecure attachment is said to not only be “right-brain” centred but primarily maintained in primitive, inferior and unconscious “reptile/mammalian brain” areas. Consequently, effective psychotherapy in the context of attachment difficulties is sometimes believed to necessitate a specific kind of “unconscious right-brain-to-right-brain communication and regulation strategy”. However, modern attachment science clearly shows that attachment is everywhere within the brain. It involves several large-scale networks spanning both hemispheres and involving many different emotional and cognitive processes. Psychotherapy in the context of attachment difficulties therefore needs to find a good balance to address both emotional and cognitive aspects and particularly their intricate interdependence.Post on Instagram.

Attachment is often linked with threat & fear, and its neurobiological basis centred around the amygdala & HPA axis. But there is much more to it! Let’s have a closer look.Attachment is a social survival mechanism. It ensures that we seek proximity to attachment figures for co-regulation when we are in distress or need. Threat & fear are vital because they activate our attachment system in the first place. The amygdala & HPA axis are two key players in this process. The amygdala rapidly picks up disturbances in our physical or mental balance. Via the HPA axis, it then triggers a cascade of neuroendocrine and physiological changes that prepare us to respond. Yet, the amygdala & HPA axis are only two players amongst many others within an extended neural “aversion module” comprising other brain regions and neuroendocrine and physiological pathways. And there is more. Once the fear response is established, a specific mechanism needs to be triggered that activates proximity seeking as our primary attachment strategy – rather than “flight-or-fight” or “freeze” behaviour. This is maintained by another extended neural “approach module” that initiates movement towards and sustained interaction with attachment figures. Furthermore, the “approach module” encodes the reunion with attachment figures as rewarding and initiates fear response termination, which allows us to return to our physical and mental balance. Important players here are dopamine, oxytocin and endogenous opioids.Two additional extended networks also come into play. Through repeated and consistent co-regulation experiences, we train our own “emotion regulation module” to more readily and efficiently engage in self-regulation. And within the “mental state representation module”, we build and maintain predictions about future interactions as part of our internal working models (IWMs) of attachment. Attachment is everywhere within the brain and related to much more than just threat & fear.Post on Instagram.

I often see people talking about “parent-child attachment” when they actually refer to “parent-child bonding”. Why is such a distinction important? Let’s have a closer look!What is child-parent attachment?An attachment relationship always consists of a “care provider” and a “care seeker”. Within a developmental context, the “care provider” is typically a parent and the “care seeker” a child. The parent functions as the child’s attachment figure towards whom they direct their attachment behaviour in times of distress and need. A child-parent attachment relationship may exist even if the parent is unavailable, rejecting or abusive. The quality of care does not determine whether or not an attachment relationship develops, but shapes whether it becomes secure, insecure or disorganised. Also, the quality is relationship specific because it generally does not transfer between attachment relationships.What is parent-child bonding?Mutual affectionate bonds exist between any people who are special to one another and seek to remain in contact. Parent-child bonding specifically refers to the process by which a parent develops an affectionate bond with and targets their caregiving behaviours towards their child. The parent-child bond’s quality is not described as secure, insecure or disorganised because the child is not the parent’s attachment figure – i.e., the parent does not become attached to their child. However, there is evidence for a close link between attachment and caregiving in that a parent’s own attachment history can influence their caregiving behaviours. While avoidantly attached parents are more likely to engage in “deactivated caregiving” characterised by coldness and distance, anxiously attached parents are more likely to display “hyperactivated caregiving” characterised by distress. Both caregiving strategies are less effective and helpful for children.ConclusionWhile bonding and attachment are closely related and the underlying neurobiological caregiving and attachment systems overlapping and complementary, they are not the same. This distinction should be reflected in our use of terminology.Post on Instagram

A lot of current parenting advice recommends parents to be constantly “in sync” with their kids: to be physically close and attuned to their children and to anticipate and immediately respond to their every need. But this is a myth! Let’s have a closer look.Yes, attachment theory and research do show that higher parental sensitivity and reflective functioning are beneficial for child development and secure attachment formation. It is helpful if parents are emotionally available, skilled in reading their children’s cues and promptly and sensitively respond to their needs. Especially when children are young.Yet, parenting advice based on these principles very often misses and misrepresents several important details – despite its good intentions.We know that for about 50-70% of the time, parents and kids are not “in sync”. They rather engage in a constant “social dance” comprising attunements, mismatches and repairs. And it’s this flow of connection, disconnection and reconnection that offers children an ideal mixture of parental support and moderate, useful stress that helps growing children’s social brains.We also know that there can be negative consequences to parents and children constantly being “tuned in” to each other. It can increase relationship stress and raise the risk for insecure child attachment. Especially if it is associated with parental overstimulation or too high parental and child responsitivity.Well then, what should parents do? Most importantly, parents should not feel that they must be “in sync” with their kids all the time and at all costs. High parent-child attunement can also reflect interaction difficulties and can often add up to parental burnout, further negatively impacting the parent-child relationship.It suffices for parents to be “good enough” – to be available when children need them rather than “always on”. What really counts is that the relationship functions well overall. That children can develop trust in their parents and that any mismatches, which naturally occur all the time, are successfully repaired. That’s the true essence of attachment theory! I recently wrote about the above in The Conversation UK.Post on Instagram

Contrary to what its name suggests, “attachment parenting” (AP) is not based on attachment theory (AT). Parenting advice building on evidence-based knowledge from extended research that keeps informing AT should thus not be confused with recommendations from AP or similar other “intensive parenting” movements. Let’s have a closer look!AP is a parenting philosophy developed by William Sears and Martha Sears during the 1980s. Its central ideas are based on their own parenting experiences and observations from their paediatric practice. There is no direct link to AT, and the name AP only emerged later – initially, the parenting philosophy was called “the new continuum concept” and “immersion mothering”. Although AP advocates for parents’ emotional responsiveness towards their children, it does so in a strongly prescriptive way linked to its seven “Baby Bs”: e.g., it proposes to breastfeed only, wearing infants on the body as much as possible and always sleeping very close to the baby. Crucially, these prescriptions are often understood to yield secure child attachment development as such. Yet, very little research and scientific evidence exist that would support such claims.What is more, AP and other “intensive parenting” movements very often make parents feel that they need to be “perfect” – highly attuned to their children and able to anticipate and immediately respond to their every need at all times. However, such constant pressure to be “perfect” often leads to unhealthy impacts on both parents and their children, including parental burnout. Of course, AT does encourage parents to be emotionally available, skilled in reading their children’s cues and promptly and sensitively respond to their needs (i.e., parental sensitivity and reflective functioning). Especially when children are young. However, it also clearly says that it suffices for parents to be “good enough” – to be available when children need them rather than “always on”. What really counts is that the relationship functions well overall. That children can develop trust in their parents and that any mismatches, which naturally occur all the time, are successfully repaired.Post on Instagram.

Many people are unaware that there is no single measure of attachment. Instead, there are many different attachment measures inspired by different psychology traditions that often yield different results. Let’s have a closer look!Attachment theory and research are inspired by two different psychology traditions: developmental psychology and social psychology. Each tradition is concerned with different attachment processes and uses its own attachment measures.The developmental psychology tradition mainly focuses on child-caregiver attachment or the recollection thereof by adults. Its measures are based on behavioural observations (e.g., the Strange Situation Procedure – SSP) and interviews (e.g., the Adult Attachment Interview – AAI). The social psychology tradition looks at attachment in adulthood within romantic (or sometimes other close) relationships. Its measures are based on self-reports (e.g., the Experiences in Close Relationships [ECR] questionnaire). Why is it important to be aware of these differences? Each attachment measure yields different results. This particularly concerns disorganisation. There only is a disorganised attachment style in children (i.e., when assessed with the SSP) but not in adults (i.e., neither the AAI nor the ECR yield a disorganised attachment style), and disorganisation in children is different from insecurity. Thus, there is no such thing as an insecure-disorganised attachment style in adults. But even for secure and insecure attachment, it’s complicated. It matters whether someone’s attachment is derived from their observed behaviour towards others as in the SSP in children. Or their verbal recollections of early relationships reflecting attachment representations (Internal Working Models) as in the AAI. Or their self-reported feelings and behaviours within romantic (or sometimes other close) adult relationships as in the ECR. Unsurprisingly, when attachment in the same person is repeatedly assessed with different measures, the results are often quite different. When you read about attachment the next time, try to check how attachment was measured and which psychology tradition is used to explain the results.Post on Instagram.

There is a big difference between attachment measures yielding insecure, disorganised and unresolved attachment classifications and clinical diagnoses of attachment disorders or other disturbances associated with attachment difficulties. Let’s have a closer look!The social psychology attachment tradition mainly uses self-reports like the ECR. The ECR can identify secure and insecure-avoidant, -anxious and -fearful(-avoidant) attachment. Crucially, all these attachment styles represent individual differences or personality traits – how people think about the availability and responsiveness of close others and of being near to and depending on them. Although self-reports can be prone to certain biases, attachment questionnaires are useful for research in large samples. They should, however, not be used as (self-)diagnostic tools in single individuals. The developmental psychology attachment tradition mainly uses behavioural observation in children (e.g., SSP) and interviews (e.g., AAI) in adults. Both approaches yield categorisations of secure, insecure-avoidant and -anxious attachment. The SSP furthermore identifies child disorganisation (see also here), and the AAI unresolved adult attachment. However, the latter categories are not clinical diagnoses of attachment disorders or other attachment-related disturbances. Attachment disorders are only clinically diagnosed in children. They are part of the DSM-5 category trauma- and stressor-related disorders and take two forms: (1) Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) and (2) Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED). They need to be independently diagnosed by a trained paediatric psychiatrist or psychologist.Unresolved adult attachment reflects unresolved experiences of trauma usually involving maltreatment or the loss of attachment figures. But it is also not a clinical diagnosis of a disorder of any sort. That said, the unresolved category is clearly overrepresented in clinical samples and is even thought to be “an almost perfect marker for dissociative disorders like PTSD”. Still, any disorders associated with adult attachment difficulties, like PTSD, require a separate diagnostic procedure by trained experts.Post on Instagram

Attachment theory has a long and rich history of scientific research across many domains and species, including psychology, evolutionary biology and neuroscience. Most recently, a strong focus has been directed towards the social neuroscience of human attachment (SoNeAt). SoNeAt uses a range of tools to study the neurobiological and brain basis of human attachment. This includes physiology (e.g., heart rate), endocrinology (e.g., secretion of hormones like oxytocin and cortisol), genetics and epigenetics, brain activity, structure and connectivity, and hyperscanning (e.g., bio-behavioural synchrony). Using these SoNeAt tools is vital to gain a full understanding of human attachment – beyond what can be observed behaviourally (e.g., SSP), extracted from interviews (e.g., AAI) and derived from self-reports (e.g., ECR). However, we need to keep two very important things in mind when using SoNeAt data to understand human attachment.First, SoNeAt data is complicated. There hardly ever is a perfect one-to-one mapping of behaviour or subjective experience to a specific brain activation pattern, genetic and epigenetic profile, or neurotransmitter secretion level. For example, there is no simple way of “increasing the bonding hormone oxytocin” – through a specific type of therapy or by nasal spray – for everybody to become more securely attached. And there is no quick fix with which it is possible to “rewire” our brains in just a couple of days to overcome trauma and attachment difficulties. Second, SoNeAt data is constantly evolving. New findings keep emerging and extending older ones. And sometimes, new findings yield novel insights that necessitate existing theories and beliefs to be replaced. That is the natural course of science. The problem is that these extensions and replacements are not always readily picked up by the public, practitioners, therapists, social services etc. This leads to the persistence of outdated concepts and beliefs like the right versus left brain dominance account, the triune brain model, polyvagal theory and many more.We need SoNeAt data to fully understand human attachment, but it is only helpful when used properly.Post on Instagram

# Attachment Myths and Facts - The Consciously Parenting Project


  

When I was first learning about attachment, I was really confused about what really mattered for a healthy relationship. While baby wearing, extended breastfeeding, and co-sleeping are biological expectations and deserve attention (and were things that I did with my own children and would do again), I think sometimes focusing on a strict adherence to these principles overshadows the message of what it means to parent in a connected, responsive way. In this video on the Myths of Attachment, learn what is most important as you find your own way in relationship with your baby, child, teen. Join me, Rebecca Thompson Hitt, MS, MFT, to get at the heart of attachment – what it is and what it is not – for children (and adults) of all ages.

Video transcript:

My name is Rebecca Thompson Hitt. I’m the founder and executive director of the Consciously Parenting Project.

When I first started learning about attachment, I was getting my master’s in Marriage and Family Therapy. And I was learning about John Bowlby and his research about the children who had been in hospital and they’d been separated from their parents because of germs. They didn’t want their children to be exposed to germs that the parents would be coming into the hospital with but they noticed that these children didn’t thrive.

And so they started looking at well, what is the relationship that’s going on there? What’s important? What are these children’s needs that may be more important than, you know, absence of germs. And so John Bowlby actually began this whole movement of really looking and studying relationships and what’s a healthy relationship and what does it mean and what does it need?

And then later Attachment Parenting came along, and these are biologically expected norms are our babies come into the world as a human baby expecting to be held expecting to be breastfed expecting to be in close proximity at night. And so these are biological norms.

1:19
It got a little confusing because Attachment Parenting for some reason became a “okay well you have to follow these these things.” So you have to co-sleep, you have to extended breastfeed, you have to do these things. And the idea that was kind of coming across there was that your child wouldn’t be securely attached (if you didn’t do these things). Your child wouldn’t be a healthy, responsible, loving person if you didn’t do all these things. And that’s a complete misconception. So what I did talk about some of the myths that I hear a lot from parents about attachment and Attachment Parenting and see if I can demystify some of that for you.

1:56


In reality, a secure attachment, which is a positive, healthy relationship, requires authenticity, and requires us as parents to say, “that’s not working for me.” I can set a loving, respectful boundary. I’m not going to let my baby bite me. I’m not going to let my toddler push me around.

And I can be gentle and loving. And if something’s not okay, I can still communicate that. That said, I think we should be saying yes, as much as possible and really look at the boundaries that we’re setting. I think some parents go overboard with this and then there’s a big disconnection there. But it’s really, really important to set a limit if it’s not working for you because they feel the dissonance between what you’re saying and how you’re actually feeling.

Generally what ends up happening then is that it builds up and builds up and then all of a sudden, now you’re exploding now you’re yelling at your kids and you’re not parenting in a way that you’re trying to parent in the first place. So it’s pulling it back together and recognizing when something’s not working with you early and communicating.

3:23
The most important things about attachment is that it’s a relationship and it needs to work for both parties. Now I highly recommend that you educate yourself and you learn about co-sleeping and you read The Family Bed or read Three in a Bed. Read something that really talks about the biological expectations and the norms and the things that the babies and we as adults need. Learn about James McKenna’s work, learn about sleep cycles, learn about these things, educate yourself, and you’ll learn that babies need to be in close proximity at night, but find what works for you.

4:01
If you are not sleeping, if nobody’s sleeping, well then sometimes we need to do something a little bit different. It isn’t about a rigid dogma or doctrine that you have to follow. It’s about relationship and that means that we need to look at it and say, “Is this working for me?”

I had a mother many many years ago who had epilepsy and she was taking medications to control her epilepsy, and so she didn’t co-sleep but she found the thing that worked best for her which was to put the baby right next to her bed so that she could still be responsive at night.

A lot of the ideas behind Attachment Parenting are about responsiveness and when we can be responsive to our baby whether that means that they’re in the same bed with us sharing the same surface, whether they’re nearby, or whether we’re very responsive to them at night and we’re meeting their nighttime needs. We’re finding our own way. That’s the relationship. And so the myth is that we have to just follow these things. The reality is that it’s a relationship and we’re going to figure out what works best for everybody.

5:13


5:22
But attachment is really about what happens in times of distress. Is your child able to reach out to you is your child able to come to you for comfort? Are you able to soothe your child? You know, barring some sort of a medical situation where your child is very uncomfortable? You know, are you able to connect in that way and meet their needs? Are they able to receive that care? This is a relationship. So it isn’t about just what happens when you’re playing nicely. But what happens when your child starts to get upset? Are you able to work through that and reconnect? It’s not that you’re handling it perfectly every time, which leads us to our next myth.


6:11
And this was one that I thought when when I had my son I thought that if I could be well regulated, calm, kind parent all the time and respond to his every need, that that was what was going to create a secure attachment. The reality is that we’re people, we’re humans, and we’re going to make tons of mistakes. We’re going to miss many, many, many cues.

I remember reading a study many years ago that talked about really, really attuned parents, really good parents, miss half to three quarters of the cues given by their children.

Take that in for a moment.

I mean, you’re missing like a majority of what your kids are signaling to you that they need. You know whether you can’t do it at that time, whether you don’t see it doesn’t matter. Those are the parents who are doing a good job. And so give yourself a break.

It’s not about doing it perfectly. But when you do notice it, it’s about being as responsive as you can. And then when you find yourself reacting in a way that you didn’t want. It’s modeling reconnection, it’s moving back in and it’s apologizing to naming what should have happened and then redoing it and and there’s there’s a huge power in that. It is a beautiful thing to remember that we don’t have to be perfect, and that we’re modeling what it is to be human to our kids as well. And that’s attachment.

 

7:48

One last myth that I wanted to mention for you and that’s that attachment ends at a certain age. A lot of the research (I read) talked about the first three years and some of the other research I read was talking about the first five years and our attachment patterns are actually set in the first year of life.

That said, attachment is something that is a lifelong thing. We need connection with other people. We are mammals we are human and we need connection throughout our lives, the relationships that we have with our partners, our attachment relationships.

So the ones that we support our children to create early in life help them for their lifespan. And at anytime in our life if we discover that our attachment isn’t where we want it to be, if the way that we are in relationship with other people isn’t really working for us, then we can make that different starting today. And parenting provides us with an amazing opportunity to do that.

If this is intriguing to you, I would highly recommend that you join us for our exploration on attachment. We’re going to be looking at your behaviors, your attachment story, we’re going to be looking at feelings and what happens when you lose it.

Attachment theory can be a wonderful tool to understand ourselves better and become aware of our beliefs about love and intimacy.

However, there are many misconceptions out there.

Sometimes, we end up having a very rigid mindset around our attachment style (we believe it’s an identity we can’t change). Other times, we think we need to be “fully healed” before entering a secure relationship.

If we want to use attachment theory and all its knowledge for the better, we need to understand how it actually works — and what we can do to become more secure.

So let’s dive into the 4 main misconceptions about attachment theory and attachment style.

It’s important to understand that attachment styles are, essentially, psychological and behavioral patterns. They’re a set of coping mechanisms we’ve developed to manage stress and feel safer in our relationships.

	 Attachment Styles and Their Impact on Adult Relationships - Students

			News, Articles, & Updates


Thursday, January 11, 2024 @ 1:21 PM

written by Christina Graziano, M.S.




Attachment theory focuses on psychological bonds in relationships and suggests that connections with primary caregivers serves as a guide for how we behave in other relationships, including friendships, partners, and our own future children. Our style of attachment impacts our feelings of security, meaning, and ability to build and sustain connection with others. According to research, there are four attachment styles:

 

Secure Attachment Style: In this attachment style, the caregiver responds to the child’s needs in a positive, consistent, and reliable manner. This type of response sends the general message that people are trustworthy and supportive. Those raised in this environment become trusting, empathetic, and responsive towards others. These individuals can easily forgive, set appropriate boundaries, and honor their own and their partner’s independence. As a result, these individuals possess a healthy view of themselves, are attuned to their emotions, and voice their wants and needs to significant others. These individuals are comfortable with intimacy and not overly preoccupied with their relationship or worried about rejection. Overall, the secure attachment style involves low levels of avoidance and low levels of anxiety.

 

General Attitude: “It is easy for me to get close to others, and I am comfortable depending on them and having them depend on me. I don’t worry about being abandoned or about someone getting too close to me.”

 

Avoidant/Dismissive Attachment Style: As its name suggests, this attachment style involves caregivers who are distant, detached, and disregard the child’s needs. In response, the child assumes their needs will not be met and often gives up trying to express their needs. As adults, these individuals pride themselves on being extremely independent and act this way to avoid potential rejection or a perception of being weak. Individuals with this style are uncomfortable with closeness and do not trust others easily. These individuals are emotionally distant, not only uncomfortable with expressing their own needs, but also dismissive or unresponsive to the needs of significant others. Overall, the avoidant attachment style involves high levels of avoidance and low levels of anxiety. 

 

General Attitude: “I am uncomfortable being close to others. I find it difficult to trust and depend on others and prefer that others do not depend on me. It is very important that I feel independent and self-sufficient. My partner wants me to be more intimate than I am comfortable being.”

 

Anxious/Preoccupied Attachment Style: This caregiver responds inconsistently to the child; sometimes positively responding to their needs and other times ignoring their needs. As a result, the child becomes worried and uncertain about whether their needs will be met. In adulthood, their needs tend to frequently change, and they expect their partners to anticipate and meet these needs. These individuals fear abandonment and are often preoccupied with their relationships, which can lead to jealous, possessive, controlling, or attention seeking behavior. As a result, these individuals may possess features of codependence and insecurity. Overall, the anxious attachment style involves low levels of avoidance and high levels of anxiety. 

 

General Attitude: “I want to be extremely emotionally close with others, but others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I often worry that my partner doesn’t love or value me and will abandon me. My inordinate need for closeness scares people away.”

 

Disorganized/Fearful-Avoidant Attachment Style: This caregiver often responds to the child’s needs with aggression or hostility, causing the child to view other people as threatening and unsafe. Consequently, the child becomes confused in relationships and view themselves as undeserving of love and support. As adults, these individuals have difficulty with trust, lack empathy towards others, and are worried about their partner’s commitment. These individuals engage in a push/pull dynamic, sometimes wanting intimacy and other times not wanting intimacy. These individuals struggle to understand their emotions and downplay the importance of relationships. Overall, the disorganized attachment style involves high levels of avoidance and high levels of anxiety. 

 

General Attitude: “I am uncomfortable getting close to others and find it difficult to trust and depend on them. I worry I will be hurt if I get close to my partner.”

 

Attachment styles learned through childhood can change.

 

When we enter relationships, each partner brings their own unresolved needs or fears. Partners often have different attachment styles, which guides their beliefs and behaviors within the relationship. To work towards a secure attachment style within your relationships, try engaging in some of these strategies:

# How Attachment Styles Influence Romantic Relationships | Columbia University Department of Psychiatry

Valentine's Day is a happy occasion for many, a time to show your love or feel loved. But for others, it's anything but. People in search of romance can be lonely, those in troubled relationships may feel even worse. But while finding a lasting love may not be easy, understanding the science of adult attachment could help you find the emotional intimacy you’re looking for. 

Relationship attachment styles are a hot topic these days, thanks in large part to the research of Amir Levine, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Columbia University. In 2010, he teamed up with longtime friend and psychologist Rachel Heller, who studied at Columbia, to write a book called Attached: The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find - and Keep – Love (Penguin Press).

The authors popularized attachment theory—the idea that early emotional bonds with our caregivers impacts our future relationships—exploring three distinct attachment styles that affect the way we deal with relationship conflicts, our feelings toward sex, and our expectations of romantic intimacy.

People with anxious attachment styles tend to be insecure about their relationships, fear abandonment, and often seek validation. Those with avoidant styles have a prevailing need to feel loved but are largely emotionally unavailable in their relationships. And a securely attached person is comfortable giving and receiving love, can trust others and be trusted, and gets close to others with relative ease.

While consistently popular with readers, Attached has recently enjoyed a resurgence. Increased social media mentions and renewed interest from the press have sent sales soaring during the past few years.

“I think it’s because many who read Attached experience the scientific content as a revelation, and it’s then hard to resist not to share with others, so they too can be helped by this information,” Levine said.

Columbia Psychiatry News asked Levine how he got the idea for Attached, if we should all aspire to secure attachment styles, and whether couples with different attachment styles are doomed to fail.

I found the work at the therapeutic nursery so meaningful that I read all the suggested material for that rotation, which included textbooks about attachment. In there, I came across the information about adult attachment and  attachment styles. At the time, I happened to also be going through a breakup and the information gave me a whole new understanding of what went on in the relationship and what lead to the breakup. Adult attachment theory posits that your attachment style as an adult affects how you behave in close, romantic relationships, and indeed it cast so many things that happened in that breakup in a different light. It was an eye-opening experience.

People all the time equate avoidance with men and masculinity and anxious styles with women, but that's not true at all. That's why I love science so much, because it helps dispel those types of myths. There are plenty of women who are avoidant and there are men who are anxious. And there a lot of women and men who are secure, which I think is the really good news because secure people can influence insecure people to become more secure.

You can find out your type by taking the Compatibility Quiz at AttachedTheBook.com. 

We can become secure, and I think that’s very promising. That capacity is one of the reasons I chose this field, which allows so much room for change and growth. There's a study that came out recently that shows that simply knowing about one’s attachment style can help people become more secure if they aspire to. It’s not about being healthy or non-healthy from an attachment perspective. It’s more about an effective or ineffective way of being in a relationship, about whether your style is working for you or isn’t.

Knowing how you and a romantic partner form attachments can be beneficial in all stages of relationships, and especially in the beginning of a relationship. Think about it as interviewing somebody for probably the most important role of your life, so you want to be in touch with all the cues and listen to see if there’s going to be good compatibility between the two of you. 

People who have anxious and avoidant attachment styles and get together doesn’t mean they’re not going to love each other; it doesn’t mean they can’t have very happy moments together. But it also means there’s going to be some incompatibility that they’re going to have to deal with. That’s a big part of what I do in my private practice. I try to help people align themselves better.

Social media can actually be helpful in relationships because it’s another tool of engaging or connecting or disconnecting. We feel safe through our connections with other people and through their availability. So, if we know how to use texting and social media in a way that helps the other person feel connected to us, we can use it to our advantage. It’s less awkward than before when you would have to call someone on the phone and talk. Now, you can connect in a text very quickly and maintain that connection until the next time you see or talk with them.

# A Brief Overview of Adult Attachment Theory and Research | R. Chris Fraley

 A Brief Overview 


Summary
Research on adult attachment is guided by the assumption that the same motivational 
        system that gives rise to the close emotional bond between parents and 
        their children is responsible for the bond that develops between adults 
        in emotionally intimate relationships. The objective of this essay is 
        to provide a brief overview of the history of adult attachment research, the key theoretical 
        ideas, and a sampling of some of the research findings. This essay has been written for people who are interested in learning more about research on adult attachment.
		
Background: Bowlby's Theory of Attachment
The 
        theory of attachment was originally developed by John Bowlby (1907 - 1990), 
        a British psychoanalyst who was attempting to understand the intense distress 
        experienced by infants who had been separated from their parents. Bowlby 
        observed that separated infants would go to extraordinary lengths (e.g., 
        crying, clinging, frantically searching) to prevent 
        separation from their parents or to reestablish proximity to a missing parent. 
        At the time of Bowlby's initial writings, psychoanalytic writers held that these expressions were manifestations 
        of immature defense mechanisms that were operating to repress emotional 
        pain, but Bowlby noted that such expressions are common to a wide variety 
        of mammalian species, and speculated that these behaviors may serve an 
        evolutionary function.
Drawing on ethological theory, Bowlby postulated that these attachment behaviors, 
        such as crying and searching, were adaptive responses to separation from 
        a primary attachment figure--someone who provides support, 
        protection, and care. Because human infants, like other mammalian infants, 
        cannot feed or protect themselves, they are dependent upon the care and 
        protection of "older and wiser" adults. Bowlby argued that, 
        over the course of evolutionary history, infants who were able to maintain 
        proximity to an attachment figure via attachment behaviors would be more likely to survive to a reproductive 
        age. According to Bowlby, a motivational system, what he called 
        the attachment behavioral system, was gradually "designed" 
        by natural selection to regulate proximity to an attachment figure.
The attachment behavior system is an important concept in attachment theory 
        because it provides the conceptual linkage between ethological models 
        of human development and modern theories on emotion regulation and personality. 
        According to Bowlby, the attachment system essentially "asks" 
        the following fundamental question: Is the attachment figure nearby, accessible, 
        and attentive? If the child perceives the answer to this question to be 
        "yes," he or she feels loved, secure, and confident, and, behaviorally, 
        is likely to explore his or her environment, play with others, and be 
        sociable. If, however, the child perceives the answer to this question 
        to be "no," the child experiences anxiety and, behaviorally, 
        is likely to exhibit attachment behaviors ranging from simple visual searching 
        on the low extreme to active following and vocal signaling on the other (see Figure 1). 
        These behaviors continue until either the child is able to reestablish a desirable level 
        of physical or psychological proximity to the attachment figure, or until 
        the child "wears down," as may happen in the context of a prolonged 
        separation or loss. In such cases, Bowlby believed that young children experienced profound despair and depression.

Individual Differences in Infant Attachment Patterns
Although Bowlby believed that the basic dynamics described above captured the normative 
        dynamics of the attachment behavioral system, he recognized that there 
        are individual differences in the way children appraise the accessibility 
        of the attachment figure and how they regulate their attachment behavior 
        in response to threats. However, it wasn't until his colleague, Mary 
        Ainsworth (1913 â 1999), began to systematically study infant-parent separations that 
        a formal understanding of these individual differences was articulated. 
        Ainsworth and her students developed a technique called the strange 
        situation--a laboratory paradigm for studying infant-parent attachment. 
        In the strange situation, 12-month-old infants and their parents are brought 
        to the laboratory and, systematically, separated from and reunited with one another. In the 
        strange situation, most children (i.e., about 60%) behave in the way implied 
        by Bowlby's "normative" theory. They become upset when the parent 
        leaves the room, but, when he or she returns, they actively seek the parent 
        and are easily comforted by him or her. Children who exhibit this pattern 
        of behavior are often called secure. Other children (about 20% 
        or less) are ill-at-ease initially, and, upon separation, become extremely 
        distressed. Importantly, when reunited with their parents, these children 
        have a difficult time being soothed, and often exhibit conflicting behaviors 
        that suggest they want to be comforted, but that they also want to "punish" 
        the parent for leaving. These children are often called anxious-resistant. 
        The third pattern of attachment that Ainsworth and her colleagues documented 
        is called avoidant. Avoidant children (about 20%) don't appear 
        too distressed by the separation, and, upon reunion, actively avoid seeking 
        contact with their parent, sometimes turning their attention to play objects 
        on the laboratory floor. 
Ainsworth's work was important for at least three reasons. First, she provided one 
        of the first empirical demonstrations of how attachment behavior is patterned 
        in both safe and frightening contexts. Second, she provided the first 
        empirical taxonomy of individual differences in infant attachment patterns. 
        According to her research, at least three types of children exist: those 
        who are secure in their relationship with their parents, those who are 
        anxious-resistant, and those who are anxious-avoidant. Finally, she demonstrated 
        that these individual differences were correlated with infant-parent interactions 
        in the home during the first year of life. Children who appear secure 
        in the strange situation, for example, tend to have parents who are responsive 
        to their needs. Children who appear insecure in the strange situation 
        (i.e., anxious-resistant or avoidant) often have parents who are insensitive 
        to their needs, or inconsistent or rejecting in the care they provide. In the years that have followed, a number of
		researchers have demonstrated links between early parental sensitivity and responsiveness and 
		attachment security.
Adult Romantic Relationships
Although Bowlby was primarily focused on understanding the nature of the infant-caregiver 
        relationship, he believed that attachment characterized human experience 
        from "the cradle to the grave." It was not until the mid-1980's, 
        however, that researchers began to take seriously the possibility that 
        attachment processes may play out in adulthood. Hazan and Shaver (1987) 
        were two of the first researchers to explore Bowlby's ideas in the context 
        of romantic relationships. According to Hazan and Shaver, the emotional 
        bond that develops between adult romantic partners is partly a function 
        of the same motivational system--the attachment behavioral system--that 
        gives rise to the emotional bond between infants and their caregivers. 
        Hazan and Shaver noted that the relationship between infants and caregivers and the relationship between adult romantic 
        partners share the following features:

both feel safe when the other is nearby and responsive
both engage in close, intimate, bodily contact
both feel insecure when the other is inaccessible
both share discoveries with one another
both play with one another's facial features and exhibit a mutual fascination 
          and preoccupation with one another
both engage in "baby talk" 

On the basis of these parallels, Hazan and Shaver argued that adult romantic 
        relationships, like infant-caregiver relationships, are attachments, and 
        that romantic love is a property of the attachment behavioral system, 
        as well as the motivational systems that give rise to caregiving and sexuality.
Three Implications of Adult Attachment Theory
The idea that romantic relationships may be attachment relationships has had 
        a profound influence on modern research on close relationships. There 
        are at least three critical implications of this idea. First, if adult 
        romantic relationships are attachment relationships, then we should observe 
        the same kinds of individual differences in adult relationships that Ainsworth 
        observed in infant-caregiver relationships. We may expect some adults, 
        for example, to be secure in their relationships--to feel confident 
        that their partners will be there for them when needed, and open to depending 
        on others and having others depend on them. We should expect other adults, 
        in contrast, to be insecure in their relationships. For example, some 
        insecure adults may be anxious-resistant: they worry that others 
        may not love them completely, and be easily frustrated or angered when 
        their attachment needs go unmet. Others may be avoidant: they may 
        appear not to care too much about close relationships, and may prefer 
        not to be too dependent upon other people or to have others be too dependent 
        upon them. 
Second, if adult romantic relationships are attachment relationships, then the 
        way adult relationships "work" should be similar to the way 
        infant-caregiver relationships work. In other words, the same kinds 
        of factors that facilitate exploration in children (i.e., having a responsive 
        caregiver) should facilitate exploration among adults (i.e., having a 
        responsive partner). The kinds of things that make an attachment figure 
        "desirable" for infants (i.e., responsiveness, availability) 
        are the kinds of factors adults should find desirable in romantic partners. 
        In short, individual differences in attachment should influence relational 
        and personal functioning in adulthood in the same way they do in childhood.
Third, whether an adult is secure or insecure in his or her adult relationships 
        may be a partial reflection of his or her experiences with his or her primary caregivers. 
		Bowlby believed that the mental representations 
        or working models (i.e., expectations, beliefs, "rules" 
        or "scripts" for behaving and thinking) that a child holds regarding 
        relationships are a function of his or her caregiving experiences. For 
        example, a secure child tends to believe that others will be there for 
        him or her because previous experiences have led him or her to this conclusion. 
        Once a child has developed such expectations, he or she will tend to seek 
        out relational experiences that are consistent with those expectations 
        and perceive others in a way that is colored by those beliefs. According 
        to Bowlby, this kind of process should promote continuity in attachment 
        patterns over the life course, although it is possible that a person's 
        attachment pattern will change if his or her relational experiences are 
        inconsistent with his or her expectations. In short, if we assume that 
        adult relationships are attachment relationships, it is possible that 
        children who are secure as children will grow up to be secure in their 
        romantic relationships. Or, relatedly, that people who are secure as adults in their relationships with their parents will be more likely to forge secure relationships with new partners.
In the sections below I briefly address these three implications in light 
        of early and contemporary research on adult attachment.
Do We Observe the Same Kinds of Attachment Patterns Among Adults that We 
        Observe Among Children?
The earliest research on adult attachment involved studying the association 
        between individual differences in adult attachment and the way people 
        think about their relationships and their memories for what their relationships 
        with their parents are like. Hazan and Shaver (1987) developed a simple 
        questionnaire to measure these individual differences. (These individual 
        differences are often referred to as attachment styles, attachment 
        patterns, attachment orientations, or differences in the 
        organization of the attachment system.) In short, Hazan and Shaver 
        asked research subjects to read the three paragraphs listed below, and 
        indicate which paragraph best characterized the way they think, feel, 
        and behave in close relationships:

A. 
          I am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others; I find it difficult 
          to trust them completely, difficult to allow myself to depend on them. 
          I am nervous when anyone gets too close, and often, others want me to 
          be more intimate than I feel comfortable being. 
B. 
          I find it relatively easy to get close to others and am comfortable 
          depending on them and having them depend on me. I don't worry about 
          being abandoned or about someone getting too close to me. 
C. 
          I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I 
          often worry that my partner doesn't really love me or won't want to 
          stay with me. I want to get very close to my partner, and this sometimes 
          scares people away. 

Based on this three-category 
        measure, Hazan and Shaver found that the distribution of categories 
        was similar to that observed in infancy. In other words, about 60% of 
        adults classified themselves as secure (paragraph B), about 20% described 
        themselves as avoidant (paragraph A), and about 20% described themselves 
        as anxious-resistant (paragraph C). 
Although this measure served as a useful way to study the association between attachment 
        styles and relationship functioning, it didn't allow a full test of the 
        hypothesis that the same kinds of individual differences observed in infants 
        might be manifest among adults. (In many ways, the Hazan and Shaver measure 
        assumed this to be true.) Subsequent research has explored this hypothesis 
        in a variety of ways. For example, Kelly Brennan and her colleagues collected 
        a number of statements (e.g., "I believe that others will be there 
        for me when I need them") and studied the way these statements "hang 
        together" statistically (Brennan, Clark, & Shaver, 1998). Brennan's 
        findings suggested that there are two fundamental dimensions with respect 
        to adult attachment patterns (see Figure 2). One critical variable has been labeled attachment-related 
        anxiety. People who score high on this variable tend to worry whether 
        their partner is available, responsive, attentive, etc. People who score 
        on the low end of this variable are more secure in the perceived responsiveness 
        of their partners. The other critical variable is called attachment-related 
        avoidance. People on the high end of this dimension prefer not to 
        rely on others or open up to others. People on the low end of this dimension 
        are more comfortable being intimate with others and are more secure depending 
        upon and having others depend upon them. A prototypical secure adult is low 
        on both of these dimensions.

Brennan's findings are critical because recent analyses of the statistical patterning 
        of behavior among infants in the strange situation reveal two functionally 
        similar dimensions: one that captures variability in the anxiety and resistance 
        of the child and another that captures variability in the child's willingness 
        to use the parent as a safe haven for support (see Fraley & Spieker, 
        2003a, 2003b). Functionally, these dimensions are similar to the two-dimensions 
        uncovered among adults, suggesting that similar patterns of attachment 
        exist at different points in the life span. 
In light of Brennan's findings, as well as taxometric research published 
        by Fraley and Waller (1998), most researchers currently conceptualize 
        and measure individual differences in attachment dimensionally rather 
        than categorically. That is, it is assumed that attachment styles are things that vary in degree rather than kind. 
		The most popular measures of adult attachment style 
        are Brennan, Clark, and Shaver's (1998) ECR and Fraley, Waller, and Brennan's 
        (2000) ECR-R--a revised version of the ECR. [Click 
        here to take an on-line quiz designed to determine your attachment style 
        based on these two dimensions.] Both of these self-report instruments 
        provide continuous scores on the two dimensions of attachment-related 
        anxiety and avoidance. [Click 
        here to learn more about self-report measures of individual differences 
        in adult attachment.]
Do Adult Romantic Relationships "Work" in the Same Way that Infant-Caregiver 
        Relationships Work?
There is now an increasing amount of research that suggests that adult romantic 
        relationships function in ways that are similar to infant-caregiver relationships, 
        with some noteworthy exceptions, of course. Naturalistic research on adults 
        separating from their partners at an airport demonstrated that behaviors 
        indicative of attachment-related protest and caregiving were evident, 
        and that the regulation of these behaviors was associated with attachment 
        style (Fraley & Shaver, 1998). For example, while separating couples 
        generally showed more attachment behavior than nonseparating couples, 
        highly avoidant adults showed much less attachment behavior than less 
        avoidant adults. In the sections below I discuss some of the parallels 
        that have been discovered between the way that infant-caregiver relationships 
        and adult romantic relationships function.
Partner selection 
        Cross-cultural studies suggest that the secure pattern of attachment in 
        infancy is universally considered the most desirable pattern by mothers 
        (see van IJzendoorn & Sagi, 1999). For obvious reasons there is no similar 
        study asking infants if they would prefer a security-inducing attachment 
        figure. Adults seeking long-term relationships identify responsive caregiving 
        qualities, such as attentiveness, warmth, and sensitivity, as most "attractive" 
        in potential dating partners (Zeifman & Hazan, 1997). Despite the attractiveness 
        of secure qualities, however, not all adults are paired with secure partners. 
        Some evidence suggests that people end up in relationships with partners 
        who confirm their existing beliefs about attachment relationships (Frazier 
        et al., 1997). 
Secure base and safe haven behavior 

        In infancy, secure infants tend to be the most well adjusted, in the sense 
        that they are relatively resilient, they get along with their peers, and 
        are well liked. Similar kinds of patterns have emerged in research on 
        adult attachment. Overall, secure adults tend to be more satisfied in 
        their relationships than insecure adults. Their relationships are characterized 
        by greater longevity, trust, commitment, and interdependence (e.g., Feeney, 
        Noller, & Callan, 1994), and they are more likely to use romantic partners 
        as a secure base from which to explore the world (e.g., Fraley & Davis, 
        1997). A large proportion of research on adult attachment has been devoted 
        to uncovering the behavioral and psychological mechanisms that promote 
        security and secure base behavior in adults. There have been two major 
        discoveries thus far. First and in accordance with attachment theory, 
        secure adults are more likely than insecure adults to seek support from 
        their partners when distressed. Furthermore, they are more likely to 
        provide support to their distressed partners (e.g., Simpson et al., 
        1992). Second, the attributions that insecure individuals make concerning 
        their partner's behavior during and following relational conflicts exacerbate, 
        rather than alleviate, their insecurities (e.g., Simpson et al., 1996). 
        
Avoidant Attachment and Defense Mechanisms
	  According 
        to attachment theory, children differ in the kinds 
        of strategies they use to regulate attachment-related anxiety. Following 
        a separation and reunion, for example, some insecure children approach 
        their parents, but with ambivalence and resistance, whereas others withdraw 
        from their parents, apparently minimizing attachment-related feelings 
        and behavior. One of the big questions in the study of infant attachment 
        is whether children who withdraw from their parents--avoidant children--are 
        truly less distressed or whether their defensive behavior is a cover-up 
        for their true feelings of vulnerability. Research that has measured the 
        attentional capacity of children, heart rate, or stress hormone levels 
        suggests that avoidant children are distressed by the separation despite 
        the fact that they come across in a cool, defensive manner.
Recent research on adult attachment has revealed some interesting complexities 
        concerning the relationships between avoidance and defense. Although some 
        avoidant adults, often called fearfully-avoidant adults, are poorly 
        adjusted despite their defensive nature, others, often called dismissing-avoidant 
        adults, are able to use defensive strategies in an adaptive way. For example, 
        in an experimental task in which adults were instructed to discuss losing 
        their partner, Fraley and Shaver (1997) found that dismissing individuals 
        (i.e., individuals who are high on the dimension of attachment-related 
        avoidance but low on the dimension of attachment-related anxiety) were 
        just as physiologically distressed (as assessed by skin conductance measures) 
        as other individuals. When instructed to suppress their thoughts and feelings, 
        however, dismissing individuals were able to do so effectively. That is, 
        they could deactivate their physiological arousal to some degree and minimize 
        the attention they paid to attachment-related thoughts. Fearfully-avoidant 
        individuals were not as successful in suppressing their emotions. 
Are Attachment Patterns Stable from Infancy to Adulthood? 
Perhaps the most provocative and controversial implication of adult attachment 
        theory is that a person's attachment style as an adult is shaped by his 
        or her interactions with parental attachment figures. Although the idea 
        that early attachment experiences might have an influence on attachment 
        style in romantic relationships is relatively uncontroversial, hypotheses 
        about the source and degree of overlap between the two kinds 
        of attachment orientations have been controversial. 
There are at least two issues involved in considering the question of stability: 
        (a) How much similarity is there between the security people experience 
        with different people in their lives (e.g., mothers, fathers, romantic 
        partners)? and (b) With respect to any one of these relationships, how 
        stable is security over time?
With respect to this first issue, it appears that there is a modest degree 
        of overlap between how secure people feel with their mothers, for example, 
        and how secure they feel with their romantic partners. Fraley, for example, 
        collected self-report measures of one's current attachment style with 
        a significant parental figure and a current romantic partner and found 
        correlations ranging between approximately .20 to .50 (i.e., small to 
        moderate) between the two kinds of attachment relationships. [Click 
        here to take an on-line quiz designed to assess the similarity between 
        your attachment styles with different people in your life.]
With respect to the second issue, the stability of one's attachment to one's 
        parents appears to be equal to a correlation of about .25 to .39 (Fraley, 
        2002). There is only one longitudinal study of which we are aware that 
        assessed the link between security at age 1 in the strange situation and 
        security of the same people 20 years later in their adult romantic relationships. 
        This unpublished study uncovered a correlation of .17 between these two 
        variables (Steele, Waters, Crowell, & Treboux, 1998). 
The association between early attachment experiences and adult attachment 
        styles has also been examined in retrospective studies. Hazan and Shaver 
        (1987) found that adults who were secure in their romantic relationships 
        were more likely to recall their childhood relationships with parents 
        as being affectionate, caring, and accepting (see also Feeney & Noller, 
        1990). 
Based on these kinds of studies, it seems likely that attachment styles in the 
        child-parent domain and attachment styles in the romantic relationship 
        domain are only moderately related at best. What are the implications 
        of such findings for adult attachment theory? According to some writers, 
        the most important proposition of the theory is that the attachment system, 
        a system originally adapted for the ecology of infancy, continues to influence 
        behavior, thought, and feeling in adulthood (see Fraley & Shaver, 
        2000). This proposition may hold regardless of whether individual differences 
        in the way the system is organized remain stable over a decade or more, 
        and stable across different kinds of intimate relationships. 
Although the social and cognitive mechanisms invoked by attachment theorists imply 
        that stability in attachment style may be the rule rather than the exception, 
        these basic mechanisms can predict either long-run continuity or discontinuity, 
        depending on the precise ways in which they are conceptualized (Fraley, 
        2002). Fraley (2002) discussed two models of continuity derived from attachment 
        theory that make different predictions about long-term continuity even 
        though they were derived from the same basic theoretical principles. Each 
        model assumes that individual differences in attachment representations 
        are shaped by variation in experiences with caregivers in early childhood, 
        and that, in turn, these early representations shape the quality of the 
        individual's subsequent attachment experiences. However, one model assumes 
        that existing representations are updated and revised in light of new 
        experiences such that older representations are eventually "overwritten." 
        Mathematical analyses revealed that this model predicts that the long-term 
        stability of individual differences will approach zero. The second model 
        is similar to the first, but makes the additional assumption that representational 
        models developed in the first year of life are preserved (i.e., they are 
        not overwritten) and continue to influence relational behavior throughout 
        the life course. Analyses of this model revealed that long-term stability 
        can approach a non-zero limiting value. The important point here is that 
        the principles of attachment theory can be used to derive developmental 
        models that make strikingly different predictions about the long-term 
        stability of individual differences. In light of this finding, the existence 
        of long-term stability of individual differences should be considered 
        an empirical question rather than an assumption of the theory. 
        
Outstanding 
        Questions and Future Directions for Research on Adult Attachment 
There are a number of questions that current and future research on attachment 
        needs to address. For example, it is probably the case that, while some 
        romantic relationships are genuine attachment relationships, others are 
        not. It will be necessary for future researchers to find ways to better 
        determine whether a relationship is actually serving attachment-related 
        functions. Second, although it is clear why attachment behavior may serve 
        an important evolutionary function in infancy, it is not clear whether 
        attachment serves an important evolutionary function among adults. Third, 
        we still don't have a strong understanding of the precise factors that 
        may change a person's attachment style. In the interest of improving people's 
        lives, it will be necessary to learn more about the factors that promote 
        attachment security and relational well-being.

Summary

Research on adult attachment is guided by the assumption that the same motivational 
        system that gives rise to the close emotional bond between parents and 
        their children is responsible for the bond that develops between adults 
        in emotionally intimate relationships. The objective of this essay is 
        to provide a brief overview of the history of adult attachment research, the key theoretical 
        ideas, and a sampling of some of the research findings. This essay has been written for people who are interested in learning more about research on adult attachment.
		

Background: Bowlby's Theory of Attachment

The 
        theory of attachment was originally developed by John Bowlby (1907 - 1990), 
        a British psychoanalyst who was attempting to understand the intense distress 
        experienced by infants who had been separated from their parents. Bowlby 
        observed that separated infants would go to extraordinary lengths (e.g., 
        crying, clinging, frantically searching) to prevent 
        separation from their parents or to reestablish proximity to a missing parent. 
        At the time of Bowlby's initial writings, psychoanalytic writers held that these expressions were manifestations 
        of immature defense mechanisms that were operating to repress emotional 
        pain, but Bowlby noted that such expressions are common to a wide variety 
        of mammalian species, and speculated that these behaviors may serve an 
        evolutionary function.

Drawing on ethological theory, Bowlby postulated that these attachment behaviors, 
        such as crying and searching, were adaptive responses to separation from 
        a primary attachment figure--someone who provides support, 
        protection, and care. Because human infants, like other mammalian infants, 
        cannot feed or protect themselves, they are dependent upon the care and 
        protection of "older and wiser" adults. Bowlby argued that, 
        over the course of evolutionary history, infants who were able to maintain 
        proximity to an attachment figure via attachment behaviors would be more likely to survive to a reproductive 
        age. According to Bowlby, a motivational system, what he called 
        the attachment behavioral system, was gradually "designed" 
        by natural selection to regulate proximity to an attachment figure.

The attachment behavior system is an important concept in attachment theory 
        because it provides the conceptual linkage between ethological models 
        of human development and modern theories on emotion regulation and personality. 
        According to Bowlby, the attachment system essentially "asks" 
        the following fundamental question: Is the attachment figure nearby, accessible, 
        and attentive? If the child perceives the answer to this question to be 
        "yes," he or she feels loved, secure, and confident, and, behaviorally, 
        is likely to explore his or her environment, play with others, and be 
        sociable. If, however, the child perceives the answer to this question 
        to be "no," the child experiences anxiety and, behaviorally, 
        is likely to exhibit attachment behaviors ranging from simple visual searching 
        on the low extreme to active following and vocal signaling on the other (see Figure 1). 
        These behaviors continue until either the child is able to reestablish a desirable level 
        of physical or psychological proximity to the attachment figure, or until 
        the child "wears down," as may happen in the context of a prolonged 
        separation or loss. In such cases, Bowlby believed that young children experienced profound despair and depression.

Individual Differences in Infant Attachment Patterns

Although Bowlby believed that the basic dynamics described above captured the normative 
        dynamics of the attachment behavioral system, he recognized that there 
        are individual differences in the way children appraise the accessibility 
        of the attachment figure and how they regulate their attachment behavior 
        in response to threats. However, it wasn't until his colleague, Mary 
        Ainsworth (1913 â 1999), began to systematically study infant-parent separations that 
        a formal understanding of these individual differences was articulated. 
        Ainsworth and her students developed a technique called the strange 
        situation--a laboratory paradigm for studying infant-parent attachment. 
        In the strange situation, 12-month-old infants and their parents are brought 
        to the laboratory and, systematically, separated from and reunited with one another. In the 
        strange situation, most children (i.e., about 60%) behave in the way implied 
        by Bowlby's "normative" theory. They become upset when the parent 
        leaves the room, but, when he or she returns, they actively seek the parent 
        and are easily comforted by him or her. Children who exhibit this pattern 
        of behavior are often called secure. Other children (about 20% 
        or less) are ill-at-ease initially, and, upon separation, become extremely 
        distressed. Importantly, when reunited with their parents, these children 
        have a difficult time being soothed, and often exhibit conflicting behaviors 
        that suggest they want to be comforted, but that they also want to "punish" 
        the parent for leaving. These children are often called anxious-resistant. 
        The third pattern of attachment that Ainsworth and her colleagues documented 
        is called avoidant. Avoidant children (about 20%) don't appear 
        too distressed by the separation, and, upon reunion, actively avoid seeking 
        contact with their parent, sometimes turning their attention to play objects 
        on the laboratory floor. 

Ainsworth's work was important for at least three reasons. First, she provided one 
        of the first empirical demonstrations of how attachment behavior is patterned 
        in both safe and frightening contexts. Second, she provided the first 
        empirical taxonomy of individual differences in infant attachment patterns. 
        According to her research, at least three types of children exist: those 
        who are secure in their relationship with their parents, those who are 
        anxious-resistant, and those who are anxious-avoidant. Finally, she demonstrated 
        that these individual differences were correlated with infant-parent interactions 
        in the home during the first year of life. Children who appear secure 
        in the strange situation, for example, tend to have parents who are responsive 
        to their needs. Children who appear insecure in the strange situation 
        (i.e., anxious-resistant or avoidant) often have parents who are insensitive 
        to their needs, or inconsistent or rejecting in the care they provide. In the years that have followed, a number of
		researchers have demonstrated links between early parental sensitivity and responsiveness and 
		attachment security.

Adult Romantic Relationships

Although Bowlby was primarily focused on understanding the nature of the infant-caregiver 
        relationship, he believed that attachment characterized human experience 
        from "the cradle to the grave." It was not until the mid-1980's, 
        however, that researchers began to take seriously the possibility that 
        attachment processes may play out in adulthood. Hazan and Shaver (1987) 
        were two of the first researchers to explore Bowlby's ideas in the context 
        of romantic relationships. According to Hazan and Shaver, the emotional 
        bond that develops between adult romantic partners is partly a function 
        of the same motivational system--the attachment behavioral system--that 
        gives rise to the emotional bond between infants and their caregivers. 
        Hazan and Shaver noted that the relationship between infants and caregivers and the relationship between adult romantic 
        partners share the following features:

On the basis of these parallels, Hazan and Shaver argued that adult romantic 
        relationships, like infant-caregiver relationships, are attachments, and 
        that romantic love is a property of the attachment behavioral system, 
        as well as the motivational systems that give rise to caregiving and sexuality.

Three Implications of Adult Attachment Theory

The idea that romantic relationships may be attachment relationships has had 
        a profound influence on modern research on close relationships. There 
        are at least three critical implications of this idea. First, if adult 
        romantic relationships are attachment relationships, then we should observe 
        the same kinds of individual differences in adult relationships that Ainsworth 
        observed in infant-caregiver relationships. We may expect some adults, 
        for example, to be secure in their relationships--to feel confident 
        that their partners will be there for them when needed, and open to depending 
        on others and having others depend on them. We should expect other adults, 
        in contrast, to be insecure in their relationships. For example, some 
        insecure adults may be anxious-resistant: they worry that others 
        may not love them completely, and be easily frustrated or angered when 
        their attachment needs go unmet. Others may be avoidant: they may 
        appear not to care too much about close relationships, and may prefer 
        not to be too dependent upon other people or to have others be too dependent 
        upon them. 

Second, if adult romantic relationships are attachment relationships, then the 
        way adult relationships "work" should be similar to the way 
        infant-caregiver relationships work. In other words, the same kinds 
        of factors that facilitate exploration in children (i.e., having a responsive 
        caregiver) should facilitate exploration among adults (i.e., having a 
        responsive partner). The kinds of things that make an attachment figure 
        "desirable" for infants (i.e., responsiveness, availability) 
        are the kinds of factors adults should find desirable in romantic partners. 
        In short, individual differences in attachment should influence relational 
        and personal functioning in adulthood in the same way they do in childhood.

Third, whether an adult is secure or insecure in his or her adult relationships 
        may be a partial reflection of his or her experiences with his or her primary caregivers. 
		Bowlby believed that the mental representations 
        or working models (i.e., expectations, beliefs, "rules" 
        or "scripts" for behaving and thinking) that a child holds regarding 
        relationships are a function of his or her caregiving experiences. For 
        example, a secure child tends to believe that others will be there for 
        him or her because previous experiences have led him or her to this conclusion. 
        Once a child has developed such expectations, he or she will tend to seek 
        out relational experiences that are consistent with those expectations 
        and perceive others in a way that is colored by those beliefs. According 
        to Bowlby, this kind of process should promote continuity in attachment 
        patterns over the life course, although it is possible that a person's 
        attachment pattern will change if his or her relational experiences are 
        inconsistent with his or her expectations. In short, if we assume that 
        adult relationships are attachment relationships, it is possible that 
        children who are secure as children will grow up to be secure in their 
        romantic relationships. Or, relatedly, that people who are secure as adults in their relationships with their parents will be more likely to forge secure relationships with new partners.

In the sections below I briefly address these three implications in light 
        of early and contemporary research on adult attachment.

Do We Observe the Same Kinds of Attachment Patterns Among Adults that We 
        Observe Among Children?

The earliest research on adult attachment involved studying the association 
        between individual differences in adult attachment and the way people 
        think about their relationships and their memories for what their relationships 
        with their parents are like. Hazan and Shaver (1987) developed a simple 
        questionnaire to measure these individual differences. (These individual 
        differences are often referred to as attachment styles, attachment 
        patterns, attachment orientations, or differences in the 
        organization of the attachment system.) In short, Hazan and Shaver 
        asked research subjects to read the three paragraphs listed below, and 
        indicate which paragraph best characterized the way they think, feel, 
        and behave in close relationships:

A. 
          I am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others; I find it difficult 
          to trust them completely, difficult to allow myself to depend on them. 
          I am nervous when anyone gets too close, and often, others want me to 
          be more intimate than I feel comfortable being. 

B. 
          I find it relatively easy to get close to others and am comfortable 
          depending on them and having them depend on me. I don't worry about 
          being abandoned or about someone getting too close to me. 

C. 
          I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I 
          often worry that my partner doesn't really love me or won't want to 
          stay with me. I want to get very close to my partner, and this sometimes 
          scares people away. 

Based on this three-category 
        measure, Hazan and Shaver found that the distribution of categories 
        was similar to that observed in infancy. In other words, about 60% of 
        adults classified themselves as secure (paragraph B), about 20% described 
        themselves as avoidant (paragraph A), and about 20% described themselves 
        as anxious-resistant (paragraph C). 

Although this measure served as a useful way to study the association between attachment 
        styles and relationship functioning, it didn't allow a full test of the 
        hypothesis that the same kinds of individual differences observed in infants 
        might be manifest among adults. (In many ways, the Hazan and Shaver measure 
        assumed this to be true.) Subsequent research has explored this hypothesis 
        in a variety of ways. For example, Kelly Brennan and her colleagues collected 
        a number of statements (e.g., "I believe that others will be there 
        for me when I need them") and studied the way these statements "hang 
        together" statistically (Brennan, Clark, & Shaver, 1998). Brennan's 
        findings suggested that there are two fundamental dimensions with respect 
        to adult attachment patterns (see Figure 2). One critical variable has been labeled attachment-related 
        anxiety. People who score high on this variable tend to worry whether 
        their partner is available, responsive, attentive, etc. People who score 
        on the low end of this variable are more secure in the perceived responsiveness 
        of their partners. The other critical variable is called attachment-related 
        avoidance. People on the high end of this dimension prefer not to 
        rely on others or open up to others. People on the low end of this dimension 
        are more comfortable being intimate with others and are more secure depending 
        upon and having others depend upon them. A prototypical secure adult is low 
        on both of these dimensions.

Brennan's findings are critical because recent analyses of the statistical patterning 
        of behavior among infants in the strange situation reveal two functionally 
        similar dimensions: one that captures variability in the anxiety and resistance 
        of the child and another that captures variability in the child's willingness 
        to use the parent as a safe haven for support (see Fraley & Spieker, 
        2003a, 2003b). Functionally, these dimensions are similar to the two-dimensions 
        uncovered among adults, suggesting that similar patterns of attachment 
        exist at different points in the life span. 

In light of Brennan's findings, as well as taxometric research published 
        by Fraley and Waller (1998), most researchers currently conceptualize 
        and measure individual differences in attachment dimensionally rather 
        than categorically. That is, it is assumed that attachment styles are things that vary in degree rather than kind. 
		The most popular measures of adult attachment style 
        are Brennan, Clark, and Shaver's (1998) ECR and Fraley, Waller, and Brennan's 
        (2000) ECR-R--a revised version of the ECR. [Click 
        here to take an on-line quiz designed to determine your attachment style 
        based on these two dimensions.] Both of these self-report instruments 
        provide continuous scores on the two dimensions of attachment-related 
        anxiety and avoidance. [Click 
        here to learn more about self-report measures of individual differences 
        in adult attachment.]

Do Adult Romantic Relationships "Work" in the Same Way that Infant-Caregiver 
        Relationships Work?

There is now an increasing amount of research that suggests that adult romantic 
        relationships function in ways that are similar to infant-caregiver relationships, 
        with some noteworthy exceptions, of course. Naturalistic research on adults 
        separating from their partners at an airport demonstrated that behaviors 
        indicative of attachment-related protest and caregiving were evident, 
        and that the regulation of these behaviors was associated with attachment 
        style (Fraley & Shaver, 1998). For example, while separating couples 
        generally showed more attachment behavior than nonseparating couples, 
        highly avoidant adults showed much less attachment behavior than less 
        avoidant adults. In the sections below I discuss some of the parallels 
        that have been discovered between the way that infant-caregiver relationships 
        and adult romantic relationships function.

Partner selection 
        Cross-cultural studies suggest that the secure pattern of attachment in 
        infancy is universally considered the most desirable pattern by mothers 
        (see van IJzendoorn & Sagi, 1999). For obvious reasons there is no similar 
        study asking infants if they would prefer a security-inducing attachment 
        figure. Adults seeking long-term relationships identify responsive caregiving 
        qualities, such as attentiveness, warmth, and sensitivity, as most "attractive" 
        in potential dating partners (Zeifman & Hazan, 1997). Despite the attractiveness 
        of secure qualities, however, not all adults are paired with secure partners. 
        Some evidence suggests that people end up in relationships with partners 
        who confirm their existing beliefs about attachment relationships (Frazier 
        et al., 1997). 

Secure base and safe haven behavior 

        In infancy, secure infants tend to be the most well adjusted, in the sense 
        that they are relatively resilient, they get along with their peers, and 
        are well liked. Similar kinds of patterns have emerged in research on 
        adult attachment. Overall, secure adults tend to be more satisfied in 
        their relationships than insecure adults. Their relationships are characterized 
        by greater longevity, trust, commitment, and interdependence (e.g., Feeney, 
        Noller, & Callan, 1994), and they are more likely to use romantic partners 
        as a secure base from which to explore the world (e.g., Fraley & Davis, 
        1997). A large proportion of research on adult attachment has been devoted 
        to uncovering the behavioral and psychological mechanisms that promote 
        security and secure base behavior in adults. There have been two major 
        discoveries thus far. First and in accordance with attachment theory, 
        secure adults are more likely than insecure adults to seek support from 
        their partners when distressed. Furthermore, they are more likely to 
        provide support to their distressed partners (e.g., Simpson et al., 
        1992). Second, the attributions that insecure individuals make concerning 
        their partner's behavior during and following relational conflicts exacerbate, 
        rather than alleviate, their insecurities (e.g., Simpson et al., 1996). 
        

Avoidant Attachment and Defense Mechanisms
	  According 
        to attachment theory, children differ in the kinds 
        of strategies they use to regulate attachment-related anxiety. Following 
        a separation and reunion, for example, some insecure children approach 
        their parents, but with ambivalence and resistance, whereas others withdraw 
        from their parents, apparently minimizing attachment-related feelings 
        and behavior. One of the big questions in the study of infant attachment 
        is whether children who withdraw from their parents--avoidant children--are 
        truly less distressed or whether their defensive behavior is a cover-up 
        for their true feelings of vulnerability. Research that has measured the 
        attentional capacity of children, heart rate, or stress hormone levels 
        suggests that avoidant children are distressed by the separation despite 
        the fact that they come across in a cool, defensive manner.

Recent research on adult attachment has revealed some interesting complexities 
        concerning the relationships between avoidance and defense. Although some 
        avoidant adults, often called fearfully-avoidant adults, are poorly 
        adjusted despite their defensive nature, others, often called dismissing-avoidant 
        adults, are able to use defensive strategies in an adaptive way. For example, 
        in an experimental task in which adults were instructed to discuss losing 
        their partner, Fraley and Shaver (1997) found that dismissing individuals 
        (i.e., individuals who are high on the dimension of attachment-related 
        avoidance but low on the dimension of attachment-related anxiety) were 
        just as physiologically distressed (as assessed by skin conductance measures) 
        as other individuals. When instructed to suppress their thoughts and feelings, 
        however, dismissing individuals were able to do so effectively. That is, 
        they could deactivate their physiological arousal to some degree and minimize 
        the attention they paid to attachment-related thoughts. Fearfully-avoidant 
        individuals were not as successful in suppressing their emotions. 

Are Attachment Patterns Stable from Infancy to Adulthood? 

Perhaps the most provocative and controversial implication of adult attachment 
        theory is that a person's attachment style as an adult is shaped by his 
        or her interactions with parental attachment figures. Although the idea 
        that early attachment experiences might have an influence on attachment 
        style in romantic relationships is relatively uncontroversial, hypotheses 
        about the source and degree of overlap between the two kinds 
        of attachment orientations have been controversial. 

There are at least two issues involved in considering the question of stability: 
        (a) How much similarity is there between the security people experience 
        with different people in their lives (e.g., mothers, fathers, romantic 
        partners)? and (b) With respect to any one of these relationships, how 
        stable is security over time?

With respect to this first issue, it appears that there is a modest degree 
        of overlap between how secure people feel with their mothers, for example, 
        and how secure they feel with their romantic partners. Fraley, for example, 
        collected self-report measures of one's current attachment style with 
        a significant parental figure and a current romantic partner and found 
        correlations ranging between approximately .20 to .50 (i.e., small to 
        moderate) between the two kinds of attachment relationships. [Click 
        here to take an on-line quiz designed to assess the similarity between 
        your attachment styles with different people in your life.]

With respect to the second issue, the stability of one's attachment to one's 
        parents appears to be equal to a correlation of about .25 to .39 (Fraley, 
        2002). There is only one longitudinal study of which we are aware that 
        assessed the link between security at age 1 in the strange situation and 
        security of the same people 20 years later in their adult romantic relationships. 
        This unpublished study uncovered a correlation of .17 between these two 
        variables (Steele, Waters, Crowell, & Treboux, 1998). 

The association between early attachment experiences and adult attachment 
        styles has also been examined in retrospective studies. Hazan and Shaver 
        (1987) found that adults who were secure in their romantic relationships 
        were more likely to recall their childhood relationships with parents 
        as being affectionate, caring, and accepting (see also Feeney & Noller, 
        1990). 

Based on these kinds of studies, it seems likely that attachment styles in the 
        child-parent domain and attachment styles in the romantic relationship 
        domain are only moderately related at best. What are the implications 
        of such findings for adult attachment theory? According to some writers, 
        the most important proposition of the theory is that the attachment system, 
        a system originally adapted for the ecology of infancy, continues to influence 
        behavior, thought, and feeling in adulthood (see Fraley & Shaver, 
        2000). This proposition may hold regardless of whether individual differences 
        in the way the system is organized remain stable over a decade or more, 
        and stable across different kinds of intimate relationships. 

Although the social and cognitive mechanisms invoked by attachment theorists imply 
        that stability in attachment style may be the rule rather than the exception, 
        these basic mechanisms can predict either long-run continuity or discontinuity, 
        depending on the precise ways in which they are conceptualized (Fraley, 
        2002). Fraley (2002) discussed two models of continuity derived from attachment 
        theory that make different predictions about long-term continuity even 
        though they were derived from the same basic theoretical principles. Each 
        model assumes that individual differences in attachment representations 
        are shaped by variation in experiences with caregivers in early childhood, 
        and that, in turn, these early representations shape the quality of the 
        individual's subsequent attachment experiences. However, one model assumes 
        that existing representations are updated and revised in light of new 
        experiences such that older representations are eventually "overwritten." 
        Mathematical analyses revealed that this model predicts that the long-term 
        stability of individual differences will approach zero. The second model 
        is similar to the first, but makes the additional assumption that representational 
        models developed in the first year of life are preserved (i.e., they are 
        not overwritten) and continue to influence relational behavior throughout 
        the life course. Analyses of this model revealed that long-term stability 
        can approach a non-zero limiting value. The important point here is that 
        the principles of attachment theory can be used to derive developmental 
        models that make strikingly different predictions about the long-term 
        stability of individual differences. In light of this finding, the existence 
        of long-term stability of individual differences should be considered 
        an empirical question rather than an assumption of the theory. 
        

Outstanding 
        Questions and Future Directions for Research on Adult Attachment 

There are a number of questions that current and future research on attachment 
        needs to address. For example, it is probably the case that, while some 
        romantic relationships are genuine attachment relationships, others are 
        not. It will be necessary for future researchers to find ways to better 
        determine whether a relationship is actually serving attachment-related 
        functions. Second, although it is clear why attachment behavior may serve 
        an important evolutionary function in infancy, it is not clear whether 
        attachment serves an important evolutionary function among adults. Third, 
        we still don't have a strong understanding of the precise factors that 
        may change a person's attachment style. In the interest of improving people's 
        lives, it will be necessary to learn more about the factors that promote 
        attachment security and relational well-being.

Attachment styles refer to how we learn to bond with our caregivers in early childhood. Those first crucial relationships with parents or other primary caretakers shape the way you behave in close relationships later in life.

Healthy relationships are integral to a healthy life. Even as babies, we become attached to people who love and care for us. But what happens when those primary relationships are not healthy and loving?

Researchers have identified four styles of attachment among adults. Attachment patterns develop during a child’s first year, but they influence our behavior throughout the rest of our lives.

Understanding your specific attachment style provides insight into understanding your behavior in relationships and can help you create the happy, fulfilling connections you deserve.

Attachment theory was developed collectively by psychologists Mary Ainsworth, Harry Harlow, and John Bowlby during the 1960s. Before these studies, we assumed that babies bond to their parents because they are the source of food and that attachment was merely a learned behavior.

But Bowlby observed that children sought out their parents when frightened or disturbed, not only when hungry. This led to the theory that nurturing and responsiveness (or lack of it) were responsible for attachment behavior. It was later theorized that the attachment methods learned in childhood influence the quality of adult relationships.

Because we are born helpless, human beings are hardwired to search out and attach to a trustworthy caregiver to keep them safe. The quality of that primary bonding experience directly affects the developing brain.

Babies with loving and responsive caregivers consistently receive reinforcement that the world is safe and that people can be trusted. Babies with unreliable, neglectful, or abusive caregivers learn a different lesson. To them, the world is an unsafe place, and as a result, the brain rewires itself to survive a hostile environment. With this foundation, these babies grow into children, teens, and adults who are hardwired to believe that trust is wrong and dangerous.

The information gathered during our most developmental years lays a foundation for handling adult relationships later in life. However, it’s important to note that caregivers are not solely responsible for shaping a person’s attachment style. Various people and interactions influence our attachment style throughout life.

A secure person can become distrustful through negative relationship experiences, and a fearful person can learn to trust through positive relationships. This plasticity is good news. It means that you are not stuck in unhealthy patterns even if your childhood was traumatic.

Attachment styles go beyond secure and insecure; researchers further break down insecure attachment styles into anxious, avoidant, and fearful-avoidant styles.

Most people can recognize their style by reading through a simplified description like the ones below.

About 60% of adults develop a secure attachment style¹. Those with this style typically approach relationships with trust and expect their love to be reciprocated.

Securely attached adults find it relatively easy to get close to others and are not afraid of emotional intimacy. They also do not worry if a friend or romantic partner needs time away. These people understand how to depend on loved ones without being dependent.

People with an anxious attachment style have a deep fear of abandonment. They tend to be insecure about the status of their relationships and worry that their friends or partners will leave them. This style of attachment is associated with clingy, needy behavior.

The most defining feature of the avoidant attachment style is a fear of intimacy. People with this attachment style are reluctant to trust others and have difficulty forming close bonds. Getting too close makes them feel suffocated or controlled. They tend to be emotionally unavailable and prefer independence.

This attachment style is a combination of both anxious and avoidant styles. People with fearful-avoidant attachment patterns avoid affection yet have a deep craving for it. They may have difficulty regulating emotions and may experience heightened sexual behavior. There is an increased risk for violence in fearful-avoidant relationships.



People with an insecure attachment style may:

If you recognize yourself in the above descriptions, early attachment patterns may be damaging your ability to maintain healthy long-term adult relationships.

Attachment issues don’t just affect romantic relationships; they can influence the way you bond with friends, employers, family members, and other important people in your life. They can also influence the way you parent your own children.

If you have trouble forming or maintaining close, meaningful relationships, attachment issues may be the core of the problem. It takes work and intention to reform your attachment style, but it is possible.

Depending on your circumstances, you will most likely need the support of an experienced therapist to help you break out of destructive relationship patterns and form healthier ways of bonding with others.

Trauma therapy is highly effective in helping survivors of childhood trauma. It focuses on identifying past trauma, then addressing and resolving it so that you can move forward without the weight of the past holding you down.

It is not unusual for insecurely attached adults to have mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, or substance and alcohol use disorders. Participating in addiction treatment or other therapies to strengthen your mental health may play a crucial role in maintaining a healthy attachment style.

You can take some practical steps right now to get clarity on your attachment patterns and work toward a better balance in all of your relationships.

Low self-esteem is common among people with insecure attachment styles. The more you can learn to love and value yourself, the more prepared you will be to participate in healthy relationships with others.

Insecure attachment patterns are rooted in the fear that a partner won’t meet your needs. That being said, no one can meet your needs if you never express them.

The habit of not being honest about your needs and desires is an act of both self-preservation and self-sabotage. It takes courage to trust others enough to let them know what you want from a relationship, but it is necessary.

The way you function in a relationship is a learned behavior. You can relearn patterns, but it may take the knowledge of a mental health expert to help make that happen.

A good therapist will help you identify your attachment patterns and teach you how to establish appropriate boundaries integral to healthy relationships.

The experienced clinicians and therapists at All Points North Lodge can help you identify and reshape your attachment style to support better, more fulfilling adult relationships.

# Attachment disorder in adults: Symptoms, causes, and more

An attachment disorder is a behavioral disorder that affects the ability to form and maintain relationships. Attachment disorders are common in children but can occur in adults.

These disorders typically develop in childhood. They can result when a child is unable to have a consistent emotional connection with a parent or primary caregiver.

There is no formal attachment disorder diagnosis for adults, but they can experience attachment issues. These can stem from untreated or undiagnosed attachment disorders in childhood.

This article describes what attachment disorders are, including the types and their symptoms. We also explore the treatment options and when to see a doctor. 

Attachment theory deals with how people form emotional bonds. The way that a person learns to form and maintain relationships primarily stems from their initial interactions with a parent or primary caregiver during childhood. Experts suggest that genetics may also play an indirect role.

However, attachment disorders are distinct, diagnosable conditions.

The professional diagnostic guidelines — the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5-R) — lists two types of attachment disorders: reactive attachment disorder (RAD) and disinhibited social engagement disorder.

While RAD often occurs as a result of early childhood mistreatment or neglect, DSED often occurs following neglect in the first two years of life.

This section explains the two types of attachment disorder. However, it is worth noting that the criteria for each focuses on the symptoms in children.

RAD typically stems from early childhood maltreatment or neglect. In adolescents, this may present as:

If the child does not receive effective treatment, the symptoms of RAD may manifest or continue into adulthood. Possible symptoms of the disorder in adults include:

DSED may develop in response to social neglect and a lack of consistent attachment to a primary caregiver during the first 2 years of life. Children in social care often demonstrate symptoms of DSED. These may include:

If a child with DSED does not receive effective treatment, the issue can manifest or continue into adulthood. An adolescent or adult with DSED may display:

Having dissociative identity disorder (DID) involves having at least two distinct personality states. Medical experts previously referred to the condition as multiple personality disorder.

However, researchers do not yet fully understand the causes of dissociative conditions, and it is a controversial diagnosis. Some theories suggest that they may develop after sexual or emotional abuse in childhood.

DID affects 1–3% of the population, but the general symptoms of dissociation are more common.A person with DID is unaware of their alter personalities, or “alters.” The “primary” personality only realizes that they have lost time — during which the alters were present. There is also a loss of sense of self in the moment for the primary personality.

Below are some signs and symptoms of the disorder. Others may notice or the person may experience:

An attachment disorder that develops in childhood may affect relationships in adulthood.

A person with an attachment disorder may have difficulty trusting others or feeling safe and secure in a relationship. As a result, they may have difficulty forming and maintaining friendships and romantic partnerships.

MR 11/13/23: I am not aware of research linking adult dissociation or substance misuse with those attachment disorders, unless the author has research they have found. Otherwise, I would not link those here.

Untreated childhood RAD or DSED can cause the following during adulthood: 

Currently, the DSM-5 does not recognize attachment disorders in adults, so an adult is unlikely to receive this diagnosis.

The treatment for a childhood attachment disorder typically involves psychotherapy — which may also benefit an adult who is experiencing a manifestation of the disorder.

An adult may find therapy or couples counseling useful. Attachment therapy focuses on helping a person overcome the impact of negative early experiences with attachment. It can also help create new, healthier attachment bonds.

Couples counseling can help people see how an attachment disorder may be affecting their relationship. With this knowledge and with the therapist’s help, couples can develop tools and strategies to strengthen their bond. 

The following are answers to frequently asked questions.

Untreated attachment disorders in childhood can cause a person to have low self-esteem, difficulty in social situations, and trouble maintaining relationships. They may also experience mental health conditions like anxiety and depression.

Psychotherapy helps a person identify and understand thoughts and behaviors that may be negatively affecting their relationships. Once a person has addressed these issues, they can develop tools and coping strategies that work.

For some people, therapy may help. Couples therapy can also be useful for people who are having difficulty in their relationships. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help a person change their thought patterns, behaviors, and actions.

A child who has experienced any form of neglect or maltreatment likely needs psychological support, regardless of whether they have an attachment disorder.

Anyone who feels that their thoughts or behaviors are negatively impacting their relationships should consider consulting a doctor or psychotherapist.

Also, any adult who has ever experienced maltreatment may benefit from discussing it with a therapist. Unresolved issues from the past may negatively impact life, emotions, and relationships. 

An adult is unlikely to receive a diagnosis of an attachment disorder because the clinical guidelines only recognize these issues in children.

Nonetheless, if a child with an attachment disorder does not receive effective treatment, the symptoms can manifest or continue into adulthood, causing difficulties with social interactions and relationships.

Children with attachment issues may either withdraw emotionally from caregivers or become overly friendly with unknown adults. Untreated, attachment disorders may negatively affect social development.

Attachment disorders describe conditions that cause children to have difficulty with emotional attachments with others. This can include a lack of emotional responses or overly emotional attachments. These conditions may cause you to have a hard time connecting and forming meaningful relationships with others as you grow older.

While the causes of attachment disorders may vary, experts believe these may be the result of inadequate caregiving. Examples may include experiencing physical or emotional abuse or neglect or experiencing a traumatic loss.

The “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5)” recognizes two main attachment disorders, which are primarily diagnosed in young children.

Read on to learn more about attachment disorders as well as the theory behind attachment, including how different attachment styles work.

There are two types of attachment disorders: reactive attachment disorder (RAD) and disinhibited social engagement disorder (DSED). The DSM-5 also considers these separate disorders, and the distinguishing symptoms are described below.

RAD involves patterns of emotional withdrawal from caregivers. Affected children may also be sad, irritable, or scared when they’re with their caregiver, even during usual daily activities.

Children with RAD usually don’t look for or respond to comfort, even when they’re upset. Due to negative experiences with adults early in life, they may also experience difficulty expressing emotions and forming relationships with others.

Additionally, children with RAD may be at an increased risk of developing hyperactivity, anxiety, and depression.

Unlike RAD, DSED involves being overly friendly with unknown adults. Children with DSED might wander off often, approach strangers with no hesitation, and hug or touch unknown adults.

Additionally, children with DSED may also tend to wander off with others or interact with strangers without checking with their parents first.

There’s no formal diagnosis for attachment disorder in adults. But you can certainly experience attachment difficulties in adulthood. For some, these may be lingering symptoms of RAD or DSED that went undiagnosed in their childhood.

Left untreated, RAD and DSED may persist in adulthood. For example, adults who experience attachment avoidancemay experience difficulties with self-disclosure within interpersonal relationships as well as intimacy with romantic partners.

While considered separate disorders, researchers believe that there may be a link between attachment disorder as a child and dissociative identity disorder (DID).

Previously known as “multiple personality disorder,” DID is one type of dissociative disorder, which describes a group of mental health conditions that cause problems with emotions, perception, and memory. Dissociative disorders may also affect your sense of self, as well as your overall behavior and identity.

It’s thought that children who experience attachment trauma may be at an increased risk of DID development. Symptoms of DID may include sudden and dramatic shifts in personal tastes, personality, and beliefs that are unwanted and can cause distress.

Attachment theory describes the way you form intimate and emotional bonds with others. Psychoanalyst John Bowlby developed the theory while studying why babies became so upset when separated from a parent.

Babies need a parent or other caregiver to take care of their basic needs. Bowlby found they used what he called attachment behaviors, such as crying, searching, and holding on to their parent, to prevent separation or to find a lost parent.

Bowlby’s study of attachment in children laid the foundation for later research on attachment in adults.

As you age, you develop your own attachment style, based largely on the attachment behaviors you learned as a child. This attachment style can have a big impact on how you form relationships as an adult.

Research also suggests that your attachment style can affect your overall happiness and day-to-day life.

Your attachment style involves your behaviors and interactions with others and how you form relationships with them. Attachment theory holds that these styles are largely determined during early childhood.

Attachment styles are broadly categorized as being either secure or insecure, with the secure styles being the most common.

If your needs as a child were usually met right away by your caregiver, you probably developed a secure attachment style. As an adult, you most likely feel secure in your close relationships and trust that the other person will be there when you need them.

If your caregiver failed to meet your needs as a child — or was slow to do so — you may have an insecure attachment style. As an adult, you might find it hard to form intimate bonds with others. You may also have a hard time trusting those close to you.

There are several subtypes of insecure attachment styles in adults.

If you have an anxious-preoccupied attachment style, you might:

If you’re need for reassurance isn’t met, you might start doubting how your loved ones feel about you. If you’re in a romantic relationship, you might frequently believe that your partner is upset with you and wants to leave.

These fears can make you more sensitive to the behaviors of those close to you. You might interpret some of their actions as proof that what you’ve worried about (them leaving) is actually happening.

If your attachment style is dismissive-avoidant, you might:

These behaviors can make it hard for others to support you or feel close to you. Moreover, if someone does put in extra effort to draw you out of your shell, you may react by closing yourself off.

Keep in mind that these behaviors don’t stem from not caring about others. Instead, it’s more about protecting yourself and maintaining a sense of self-sufficiency.

If you have a fearful-avoidant attachment style, you might:

While you might be able to suppress your emotions for a period of time, they may tend to come out in bursts. This can feel overwhelming and create a pattern of highs and lows in your relationships with others.

Children who are suspected to have RAD or DSED may benefit from an evaluation from a mental health professional. This professional will also likely involve the child’s caregivers in treatment to help strengthen these relationships.

Left untreated, attachment disorders can adversely affect a child’s emotional and social development. This can also lead to relationship difficulties as they get older.

While you might not have much of a say over the attachment behaviors you develop as a child, there are steps you can take to develop a more secure attachment style as an adult.

Learning more about why you feel and think the way you do is key to overcoming insecure attachment styles. Start by looking for a therapist you feel comfortable talking with.

They can help you:

Finding a therapist can feel daunting, but it doesn’t have to be. Start by asking yourself a few basic questions:

The 5 conditions for secure attachment

Attachment issues arise from disruptions in the early caregiver-child bond. Undoubtedly, these disruptions significantly affect someones’ ability to trust in others or feel safe in relationships. However, when a caregiver consistently doesn’t fulfill their child’s emotional needs or displays abusive or neglectful behavior, the child may develop an attachment disorder.    

Child attachment disorders can significantly impact a child’s social and cognitive development, making it difficult to form healthy relationships later in life. Furthermore, when a child with an attachment disorder doesn’t receive treatment, they may develop an adult attachment disorder. 

Still, it’s reassuring to know that treatment options are out there for attachment disorders; therapy and medication are concurrently effective for treating attachment disorders and the conditions that commonly co-occur. 

To answer any questions you may have on attachment issues, this article will cover: 

You may be wondering what attachment issues are. And whether they’re interchangeable with attachment disorders. Let’s break it down.

Disruptions in the development of a healthy bond between a child and their primary caregiver(s) can cause attachment issues, meaning the child may struggle with:

An attachment disorder, on the other hand, is more than just “attachment issues.”

Attachment disorders are a severe form of attachment issue that can significantly impact someone’s ability to function in daily life. Those with an attachment disorder may show socially inappropriate behaviors or retreat from social interactions, as they don’t know what a healthy relationship looks like. To further understand how these disorders develop, we may need to consider the underpinnings of attachment theory.

Attachment theory arose from British psychologist John Bowlby’s revolutionary thinking about the importance of the infant-caregiver bond in human development. 

In his post-WWII work with orphaned and homeless children, Bowlby developed the concept that children must experience an intimate, warm, and continuous relationship with their primary caregiver to grow up mentally healthy. He named this concept “attachment theory.”

Bowlby suggested the fundamental elements of attachment theory to be the following:

As human beings, we have an innate drive to connect with others and form secure relationships.

How a caregiver treats their child will significantly impact the child’s social and cognitive development. 

Early attachment experiences influence later relationships. 

When a child doesn’t receive this warm, continuous, and intimate bond with their caregiver, attachment issues can develop. And when a child receives abuse or neglect from their primary caregiver, or if their emotional needs consistently go unmet, the child may develop an emotional attachment disorder. 

Attachment issues and disorders can influence a child’s ability to regulate their emotions and form healthy relationships. It can also put them at a higher risk of developing mental health issues and behavioral problems. However, the exact influence we see differs on the child’s attachment disorder. 

When a caregiver consistently doesn’t meet their child’s basic emotional needs, the child may develop a childhood attachment disorder. If a child with an attachment disorder continues through life without treatment, an adult attachment disorder may develop. 

The home environment that causes each childhood attachment disorder may outwardly look similar, but the symptoms of each disorder are vastly different, as is apparent from the following descriptions:

Reactive attachment disorder is an attachment disorder in children. Children with RAD typically try to remove themselves from social interaction as they see relationships as unsafe. These children often become withdrawn, unresponsive, and excessively independent.

Disinhibited social engagement disorder is another form of child attachment disorder. Children with DSED may be highly sociable. For example, such children are typically overly friendly, past the boundaries of regular social interaction. They may also be extremely friendly to strangers, potentially putting themselves in dangerous situations.

This attachment disorder develops when a child with a reactive or disinhibited social engagement disorder doesn’t receive treatment. An adult attachment disorder is a continuation of a previous attachment disorder, so the person will show similar symptoms as they did in childhood, but these symptoms will instead affect their adult relationships. 

When less severe disruptions occur in early relationships, a person may develop an insecure attachment style (rather than an attachment disorder). In adulthood, we split the insecure attachment styles into:

Everyone’s experience of attachment issues and attachment disorders is different, and the symptoms may show up in different ways. Yet, people with the same attachment style or disorder tend to show similar patterns of behavior, allowing us to identify the common signs. To help clarify the differences between attachment issues and attachment disorders, we outline these common patterns below.

The signs of attachment issues differ depending on your attachment style; avoidant, anxious, or disorganized. The following are the symptoms of each style:

Signs of avoidant attachment issues may include:

Signs of anxious attachment issues include:

Signs of disorganized attachment issues typically include:

As we know, the signs of each attachment disorder differ. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), a handbook used by healthcare professionals in the US to diagnose mental disorders, provides a classification for RAD and DSED. 

Below, you’ll find the DSM-5 criteria for each attachment disorder.

The DSM-5 criteria for RAD

The DSM-5 criteria for DSED

When considering the risk factors of and appropriate treatment for attachment disorders, it’s important to analyze what causes attachment issues–and why they develop into disorders. According to the American Psychology Association, for an attachment disorder to develop, a person must experience severe emotional neglect or insufficient early care. There are certain risk factors in the home environment that increase the likelihood of attachment issues and subsequent disorders. 

The risk factors for attachment disorders typically fall into two main categories:

Let’s discuss each in turn. 

When we talk about the consistent availability of a caregiver, we’re referring to their ability to meet their child’s needs and repeatedly support them emotionally over time. Children are at a higher risk of developing an attachment disorder when this consistent availability isn’t present. 

Various factors may prevent a caregiver from showing consistent availability. For example, children may experience a blockage to attachment security when frequently moved around in foster care or when placed in institutional care. 

Another factor that puts children at a higher risk of developing an attachment disorder is the loss of a primary caregiver. This loss could be through death, imprisonment, or voluntarily leaving. The sudden loss of an important attachment figure can leave a child feeling like the world isn’t a secure place and that people can leave at any moment. This sense of insecurity and doubt can make relationships feel unsafe.

A primary caregiver may be unable to meet their child’s emotional needs for various reasons. Firstly, they may have an insecure attachment style themselves. If a caregiver’s parents never modeled the correct behavior to them as children, they typically don’t understand how to act appropriately to their own children. Furthermore, a caregiver who has experienced severe abuse or neglect often finds providing adequate care for their child more challenging. As a result of their chaotic childhood, they may have unsafe or inaccurate representations of love and care. 

A caregiver experiencing mental health concerns can also find meeting their child’s needs difficult. For example, maternal depression symptoms during pregnancy can impact the prenatal attachment bond between mother and baby. And when depressive symptoms extend into the postnatal stage, the mother-baby bond is less likely to be secure than in non-depressed mothers. 

We see similar findings with maternal anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Babies are more prone to develop attachment insecurity if their primary caregiver is severely affected by these mental health concerns. 

Other factors that may inhibit a caregiver’s ability to meet their child’s needs are:

The treatment options for attachment disorders differ depending on the severity of the disorder, a person’s age, and their individual needs. However, there are some common treatment options available for attachment disorders.

Psychotherapy, also known as talk therapy, can help those with an attachment disorder understand what a healthy, non-judgmental relationship looks and feels like. Talk therapy can also help individuals with an attachment disorder become more aware of their emotions, behaviors, and attachment patterns, as well as how these influence their relationships.

The main forms of psychotherapy for attachment disorders are:

Medication isn’t frequently used as a primary treatment for attachment disorders because these conditions manifest from relational issues. However, medication can help reduce the symptoms of conditions that commonly co-occur with attachment problems, like depression and anxiety. It’s important to speak to a medical professional regarding your symptoms, as they will help guide you on the most appropriate route of treatment for your needs.

Home environments where a child experiences severe disruptions in their relationship with their caregiver can significantly impact their social and cognitive development. In the cases of neglect or abuse, a child may develop a reactive attachment disorder or disinhibited social engagement disorder. 

Attachment disorder symptoms typically include difficulties forming healthy relationships, developing a positive sense of self, and regulating emotions. If a childhood attachment disorder goes untreated, these symptoms may extend into adulthood, known as an adult attachment disorder. 

The good news is that therapy and medication can effectively treat attachment disorders, helping individuals form and maintain healthy outlooks and relationships in adulthood. By understanding attachment disorders, we can better identify the signs, seek proper treatment, and support those struggling with these problems.

Attachment theory is a biopsychosocial model referring to a person’s characteristic ways of relating in close relationships, such as with parents, children, and romantic partners. These ways of relating are learned during early infancy and mold subsequent intimate relationships. An adult who is securely attached has internalized a reliable relationship to his/her caregivers in infancy, and thus is capable of adapting to different social contexts and, more importantly, of maintaining an adequate equilibrium between self-regulation and interpersonal regulation of stress. Insecure adult attachment styles are divided into 1) anxious/preoccupied (individuals are hypersensitive to rejection and show compulsive care- and attention-seeking behavior); 2) avoidant/dismissing (individuals are hyposensitive to social interactions, and are socially isolated); and 3) unresolved/disorganized (individuals are unable to cope under stress, thus suffering pervasive affective dysregulation). This review discusses the theoretical, psychological, neuroscientific, and developmental aspects of attachment from an evidence-based perspective. It provides an updated account of the science regarding attachment and its relevance to the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illness. It examines the privileged relation between attachment and personality disorders (PDs) from multiple angles in order to introduce the most recent psychotherapeutic advances, based on attachment research, for the treatment of PDs, particularly borderline PD. Three effective, evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions are described: Mentalization-Based Treatment, Transference-Focused Psychotherapy and Schema-Focused Therapy.

Attachment theory, conceived by John Bowlby (1), refers to a person’s characteristic ways of relating in intimate relationships to “attachment figures,” often one’s parents, children, and romantic partners (2, 3). From birth, the interactions of an infant with his/her primary caregivers will establish a base for personality development and will mold subsequent close relationships, expectations of social acceptance, and attitudes to rejection. A secure base is formed when the attachment figure (usually the mother) provides stability and safety in moments of stress, which allows the infant to explore his/her surroundings. Thus, the child creates a set of mental models of him/herself and others in social interactions (“internal working models”), based on repeated interactions with significant others (4). These early attachment relations are crucial for the acquisition of capacities for affect and stress regulation, attentional control, mentalization, and for the infant’s sense of self-agency (5).

The attachment literature has been dominated by operationalized assessments of characteristic patterns of relating. Most influential were observations of individual differences in infants’ attachment security assessed by the Strange Situation procedure (6). When briefly separated from their caregivers and left with a stranger in an unfamiliar setting, infants show certain behavioral patterns. Three distinct attachment patterns have been identified from the application of this procedure: secure (63% of children tested), anxious/resistant or ambivalent (16%), and avoidant (21%). In adults, attachment style is respectively classified as secure/autonomous (58% of the nonclinical population), avoidant/dismissing (23%), and anxious/preoccupied (19%) (7, 8); these classifications stem from the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) (9, 10), which elicits attachment narratives from the subject’s childhood. Further work has revealed a fourth pattern of disorganized attachment, which is often termed unresolved/disorganized for adults and disoriented/disorganized for infants (2). Adults showing this pattern are also classified within one of the three primary categories (5).

During the Strange Situation, a securely attached infant readily explores his/her new surroundings in the primary caregiver’s presence, shows anxiety in the stranger’s presence, is distressed by the caregiver’s brief absence, rapidly seeks contact with the caregiver upon reunion, and is reassured by renewed contact, rapidly resuming exploration. Likewise, an adult categorized as secure/autonomous during the AAI coherently integrates attachment memories into a meaningful narrative and shows appreciation for attachment relationships.

An avoidant infant is less anxious at separation, may not seek contact with the caregiver on his/her return, and may not prefer the caregiver to the stranger. In adults, avoidant/dismissing AAI narratives will lack coherence; patients will be unable to recall specific memories in support of general arguments and will idealize or devalue their early relationships (5). These behaviors appear as the result of a “hyper-deactivation” of the attachment system. This hyper-deactivation is characterized by the inhibition of proximity-seeking behaviors and the determination to handle stress alone. This implies a clear attempt to inhibit negative emotions through a noninterpersonal way of regulating them (11).

An anxious/resistant infant shows limited exploration and play, seems highly distressed by the separation, and does not easily settle after reunion. Correspondingly, an anxious/preoccupied adult’s AAI narratives will lack coherence and will show confusion, anger, or fear in relation to early attachment figures (5). This corresponds to the hyperactivation of proximity-seeking and protection-seeking strategies, to a (chronic) hypersensitivity to signs of possible rejection or abandonment, and to an intensification of undesirable emotions (11).

A disoriented/disorganized infant will show undirected or bizarre behavior such as freezing, hand clapping, or head banging. The infant may try to escape the situation. Comparably, an unresolved/disorganized adult’s narratives about bereavements or childhood traumas will contain semantic and/or syntactic confusions. This corresponds to the breakdown of strategies to cope with stress, leading to partial or even pervasive emotion dysregulation.

These styles remain relatively stable during life and do not show gender differences or variations with language or culture (8). There is a 68%−75% correspondence between attachment classification in infancy and in adulthood (5). The most important predictor of style change during life is negative early life events, such as loss of a parent, parental divorce, life-threatening illness of parent or child, parental psychiatric disorder, physical maltreatment, or sexual abuse (12–14).

Although attachment processes are normative and necessary for human (and mammalian) survival, attachment theory is increasingly being used to investigate and intervene in personality disorders (PDs) (8, 15–17). PDs are enduring behaviors (18); their features include an intrapersonal component (dysregulation of arousal, impulse, and affect), an interpersonal component (dysfunctional relationship patterns), and a social component (which creates conflicts with others and with social institutions) (16). Attachment theory accounts for these four characteristics of PDs (19) and provides an ideal standpoint to understand these disorders, integrating psychological (20), psychiatric (21), genetic (22), developmental (23–25), neuroscientific (25–28), and clinical (2, 29–31) perspectives.

There is a large body of literature addressing the relation between PDs and attachment theory and research. This review approaches this relation from an evidence-based perspective, highlighting implications for the treatment of PDs.

Many of the features of insecure attachment in adulthood resemble the signs and symptoms of PD (16). There have been numerous studies of attachment patterns in people with PDs, particularly of the DSM-IV cluster B (32), which indicate that such individuals show higher rates of insecure attachment than the general population (33). Conversely, secure attachment is rarely associated with borderline PD (BPD) and avoidant PD (19, 34).

Adults presenting a preoccupied style are more sensitive to rejection and anxiety, and are prone to histrionic, avoidant, borderline, and dependent PDs. Conversely, the hypoactivation of attachment shown by dismissing individuals is associated with schizoid, narcissistic, antisocial, and paranoid PDs (8, 19, 35–38).

BPD is strongly associated with preoccupied attachment in the presence of unresolved trauma (6, 8, 15, 19, 36, 39) and with unresolved attachment patterns (19). Studies have found that 50%−80% of BPD patients fit either or both of these attachment styles (11, 40). This makes sense in light of both the approach-avoidance social dynamics and sensitivity to rejection (preoccupied dimension) and the cognitive-linguistic slippage (incoherent/disorganized dimension) evident in BPD patients (19). Misunderstanding of social causality and thought disturbances are distinctive features of BPD (41–43). In behavioral terms, BPD patients exhibit angry withdrawal and compulsive care-seeking. This implies a lack of the capacity to use and obtain relief from new attachment figures, which has important implications within a close helping relationship such as the therapeutic exchange: BPD patients will be more attentive to the failures than the efforts of the therapist (15, 40, 44, 45). The same associations between attachment styles and pathological personality features are found in adolescents (19, 23, 46).

Most research assessing the relation between attachment and PDs does not control for comorbidity on either Axis I or II, which could result in diffuse patterns of association (11, 19). In the case of BPD, different Axis I comorbidities are associated with different attachment styles: BPD with comorbid anxiety or mood disorders tends to be associated with preoccupied attachment, while BPD with comorbid substance or alcohol abuse tends toward a dismissing style. In spite of these differences, the unresolved/disorganized attachment style seems to be common in BPD overall, which explains the pathognomonic emotional dysregulation of BPD patients (11). These research limitations accentuate the value of the new efforts toward dimensional rather than categorical diagnostic systems (21, 47), and for person-centered rather than symptom-centered ways of addressing mental disorders (11, 19, 21, 38, 48–50). Such ways of understanding and conceptualizing psychopathology (and particularly PDs) (38) are necessarily longitudinal, because only a developmental perspective can offer an insight into the processes underlying symptomatic manifestations and allow clinicians to assess a particular patient’s risks and strengths, account for high rates of comorbidity, tailor interventions, and maintain a fruitful therapeutic relationship (11, 26, 44, 51, 52).

It is likely that various developmental pathways lead to a given attachment style and its concomitant psychopathological risks, involving complex interactions between biological and psychosocial factors.

The stable nature of attachment styles accounts for the development of enduring strategies to regulate emotion and social contact. Securely attached individuals trust their attachment figures and perceive little environmental threat. As a result, they can defend themselves against environmental challenges and are able to process emotions in a fluid and nondefensive way; hence, they are the group least troubled by PDs. These individuals continue seeking effective attachment relations through their whole lifespan (53). Dismissing individuals, chronically lacking support from attachment figures, habitually deny or dismiss environmental threats (54). They may therefore have a higher threshold for experiencing negative emotions or perceiving attachment needs, exhibiting what Bowlby called “compulsive self-reliance” (55). Preoccupied individuals, who are wary following a history of inconsistent support from caregivers, are likely to have a lower threshold for perceiving environmental threat and, therefore, stress. This is likely to contribute to frequent activation of the attachment system, with the concomitant distress and anger such activation can cause. Hence, they are likely to manifest compulsive care-seeking and over-dependency. Unresolved/disorganized individuals—the adult analog of disorganized/disoriented infants—frequently have parents who are themselves abusive or unresolved regarding their own losses or abuse experiences (56–59). These individuals appear to be the most troubled in terms of PDs (17).

Twin studies have shown that genetic factors account for 45% of individual differences in adult attachment anxiety and 36% in attachment avoidance (22). The influence of genetic factors in attachment security has been estimated at between 23% and 45% and underscores the bidirectional nature of the development of attachment relationships: infants and children cocreate patterns of relating with their caregivers. There is great overlap between genetic factors influencing both attachment style and personality traits (60–63). Nevertheless, to the extent that these are separable, environmental factors ubiquitously appear to be the most important influence in the development of attachment. Among external factors, the most important is the secure presence of an effective primary caretaker who is sensitive to the infant’s verbal and nonverbal cues and is able to respond to them without being overwhelmed by anxiety. A child who is securely attached has had his/her acute affective states consistently reflected back to him/her in an accurate, but not overwhelming, manner (26, 54, 64). This process equips the infant with an increasing capacity for mental processing, particularly mentalization, the capacity to understand the social world and one’s internal world in terms of mental states; that is, the capacity to imagine that others have a mind that is essentially like one’s own (39, 51, 57, 58, 65–67). This capacity means that individuals with a healthy personality interpret and respond to another’s feelings, not just to their own experience. In this sense, the emergence of spoken language about feelings seems to be related to the attachment figure’s ability to put the child’s mental experience into words: securely attached children seem to acquire speech more rapidly and remain more verbally competent than insecure children (29, 68). Conversely, insecure attachment leads to developmental impairment of the internal state lexicon and subsequent alexithymia in adulthood (69). Effective therapies must therefore include a component that allows patients to recognize, label, and verbally communicate their feelings (26, 70–72).

Good-quality interactions with early caregivers are the critical element in the development of secure attachment. In turn, secure emotional attachment is more crucial for the development of a healthy personality than intellectual stimulation of the infant (25). It is thus unsurprising that there is a high prevalence of childhood trauma in both insecurely attached individuals and PD patients (8, 45, 73–76). Childhood trauma is more strongly correlated with an incoherent/disorganized adult attachment style than with the general category of attachment insecurity (19, 36).

Rates of childhood trauma among individuals with PDs are high (73% report abuse, of which 34% is sexual, and 82% report neglect). Compared with nonclinical adults, PD patients are four times as likely to have suffered early trauma (14). Childhood physical abuse increases the risk for adult antisocial, borderline, dependent, depressive, passive-aggressive, and schizoid PDs (38). Infantile neglect is associated with risks for antisocial, avoidant, borderline, narcissistic, and passive-aggressive PDs (14, 54, 77). BPD is more consistently associated with childhood abuse and neglect than other PD diagnoses (14, 24, 51, 66, 73, 76, 77). Obsessive-compulsive PD has been associated with sexual abuse by noncaretakers (77).

However, not all people who have suffered childhood trauma develop adult psychopathology. The effects of trauma are influenced by attachment (75) and by biological dispositions, which are examined in the next section. For example, female victims of maltreatment and sexual abuse in adolescence or adulthood are at greater risk of developing posttraumatic symptoms if they have an anxious attachment style (78). Likewise, female victims of childhood trauma are more likely to develop somatization symptoms if they are fearfully attached (79). If traumatic events provoke activation of the attachment system, then individuals who tend to respond to these experiences through the inhibition of mentalizing function and emotional regulation are less likely to resolve these events and more likely to manifest personality pathology later in life (80).

New technologies in human and animal neurosciences have enabled the investigation of both attachment and PDs from an enriching and novel perspective. A seminal discovery has been the identification of neural correlates of the innate predisposition to, and later need for, attachment relations. There is a common neurobiology of mother-infant, infant-mother, and romantic-partner attachment, linked to opioid alkaloids that are capable of reproducing the same neurological and behavioral effects as substance addiction (81, 82). Following these discoveries, two major neural systems have been shown to play a critical role in attachment behaviors: the dopaminergic reward-processing system and the oxytocinergic system (26). The role of the dopaminergic reward system in attachment behavior is understood as an evolutionary mechanism to motivate reproductive mating, maternal care, and, ultimately, offspring survival. It leads individuals to seek close relations with other humans and produces satisfaction when they are attained. The areas of the brain recruited by this system include the striatum, a key projection of midbrain dopamine neurons that includes the putamen and caudate head (26).

Oxytocin is a neuroactive hormone produced in the hypothalamus and projected to brain areas that are associated with emotions and social behaviors. It plays an important role in the activation of the dopaminergic reward system (oxytocin receptors are located in the ventral striatum, a key dopaminergic area) and the deactivation of neurobehavioral systems related to social avoidance (26, 28). Oxytocin receptors are found in areas known to be recruited in attachment and other social behaviors, such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, central nucleus of the amygdala, ventral tegmental area, and lateral septum. These areas are also rich in vasopressin (V1a) receptors, but oxytocin has been studied more extensively because it can be synthesized in the laboratory and safely administered to human subjects; therefore, experimental oxytocin research has been popular over the past decade. The experimental administration of vasopressin agonists in studies of attachment has not yielded significant results (83).

Oxytocin is a facilitator of attachment (24, 84): it enhances sensitivity to social cues (85–87), accelerates social connectedness (88), improves social memory (89, 90), and facilitates the encoding and retrieval of happy social memories (91). By attenuating activity in the extended amygdala (92), oxytocin also acts to neutralize negative feelings toward others, and enhances trust (88, 93, 94). Oxytocin can inhibit hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity when the attachment system is activated (26): secure attachment leads to “adaptive hypoactivity” of the HPA axis, which, in turn, reduces social anxiety (53).

It must be noted that these positive effects of oxytocin are not universal. The administration of oxytocin to adults has been shown to facilitate prosocial behavior toward members of their in-group only, and to enhance trust toward reliable and neutral peers but not peers who have proven to be unreliable (95, 96). The effects of oxytocin administration are also personality-dependent: individuals with alexithymia seem to improve their social abilities to a greater extent than people who do not show this trait (97).

Correspondingly, insecure attachment is closely bound to the divergent effects of oxytocin. The neuropeptide is found in lower concentrations among maltreated children and adults with a history of early separation, and in insecurely attached mothers during the puerperal period, which further hampers the establishment of secure attachment in their children (26). In the case of insecurely attached BPD patients, oxytocin decreases trust and the likelihood of cooperative responses and reduces dysphoric responses to social stress (27, 98).

In conclusion, oxytocin does not uniformly facilitate trust and prosocial behavior; its behavioral effects are mediated by the social context, personality traits, and the quality of early attachment (27, 99). This highlights the need to address PDs and mental health in general as an indivisible combination of environmental, psychological, and physical factors (25, 76).

This integrated, biopsychosocial perspective for understanding PDs is still novel. Most research has focused on BPD and antisocial PD (45, 100). For example, early maltreatment is more likely to produce adult antisocial behavior only in males with a polymorphism in the gene involved in the production of the neurotransmitter-metabolizing enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). Males with high MAOA activity show less antisocial behavior even if they have experienced early maltreatment. This indicates that certain genotypes can moderate sensitivity to stressors (101). In monkeys, impulsive aggression is correlated with low cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), which is involved in serotonergic metabolism. However, this inherited characteristic is modulated by attachment experiences: monkeys reared by mothers show higher concentrations of 5-HIAA than those reared by peers (102, 103). People with an avoidant attachment style show decreased activity of the striatum and ventral tegmental area, suggesting lack of response to social rewards. Conversely, people with a preoccupied attachment style show increased activity in the left amygdala, suggesting increased sensitivity to social punishment (104). In these cases attachment moderates the relation between genotype, nervous activity, and pathologic behavior.

As described in the previous section, early trauma has implications for attachment and personality pathology. The hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to stress, given its many glucocorticoid receptors. BPD patients show reduced hippocampal and amygdalar volumes, especially if they have suffered early trauma (45, 105–107). Relational trauma promotes hemispheric lateralization, which adversely affects the early integration of brain hemispheres (108, 109). As a consequence, affective experiences, which are usually stored in the right front lobe, are split from the cognitive functions of the left hemisphere, explaining in part the emotional dysregulation found in BPD patients (26, 45, 100, 109, 110). Childhood trauma produces persistent sensitization of the HPA axis, which regulates stress responses. This effect is particularly noticeable in BPD females who have been abused (111, 112). The HPA axis is intimately linked with serotonergic function, which could explain the divergent effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in BPD patients (113, 114).

These complex interactions between “nature” and “nurture” put the concept of attachment in a privileged position from which to understand the etiology, development, and treatment of PDs (45, 110, 115, 116). Attachment is becoming a central concept in the development, planning, and assessment of psychotherapeutic interventions. At the same time, researchers are starting to assess the effects of psychotherapy on attachment and relating them to process and outcome (31, 117, 118).

Considering that empirical evidence demonstrates that insecure attachments are risk factors for PDs and other mental illnesses, researchers have taken an interest in the relationship between attachment and psychotherapeutic success.

It is widely accepted that attachment characteristics influence psychotherapeutic outcomes, but results are inconsistent (119, 120). Most studies show that securely attached patients obtain better results (2, 34, 120–123), but others indicate better outcomes for avoidant and disorganized patients (39).

The largest meta-analysis on the influence of attachment on psychotherapeutic outcome in various diagnoses (including PDs) and heterogeneous psychotherapeutic orientations consistently found that while attachment anxiety negatively affects outcome, attachment avoidance has no effect. This meta-analysis confirmed that higher attachment security predicts better therapeutic outcomes (2).

Besides symptomatic outcomes, attachment is associated with dropout. Adult avoidant attachment constitutes a risk for dropout because patients are not fully committed, attached, or engaged with the therapist or the treatment (38, 124). Psychotherapy can be seen as a threat to these patients’ defensive apathy and increases negative transference (124, 125). Contrastingly, preoccupied patients are at risk of dropout after perceived abandonments such as emergency cancellations or scheduled vacations. Fearfully preoccupied individuals are prone to dropout in response to feeling attached to or dependent on the therapist and treatment (126).

Attachment also influences the therapeutic alliance, which in turn has important effects on outcome (127). While secure patients perceive their therapists as responsive and emotionally available, avoidant/fearful patients are reluctant to make personal disclosures, feel threatened, and suspect that the therapist is disapproving. Preoccupied patients long for more contact with the therapist and wish to expand the relationship beyond the bounds of therapy (44, 128).

Following Bowlby’s attachment theory, not only protection-seeking but also caregiving behavior is influenced by attachment (129). Therefore, the therapist’s attachment style also influences the process and outcome of treatment. Therapists with anxious attachment styles create strong therapeutic alliances, but the quality of the alliance decreases with time when patients show interpersonal distress (130, 131). Sessions between an avoidant therapist and an anxious patient attain less depth (121).

Some studies have shown changes in patients’ attachment resulting from treatment. One of the authors (P.F.) reported on a sample of BPD patients under psychodynamic treatment. After treatment, 40% of the sample was classified as secure; none of the patients had that classification at pretreatment (132). Patients with various diagnoses showed an increase in attachment security after 21 sessions of psychodynamic psychotherapy (133). A multisite study of several inpatient group psychotherapies found consistent improvement (compared with controls) of attachment security after 9 weeks’ treatment, which was maintained at 1-year follow-up (119). In a randomized controlled trial of Transference-Focused Psychotherapy (TFP), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and supportive therapy, only TFP showed an increased number of patients classified as secure after treatment (118). A successful treatment does not necessarily imply attainment of a secure attachment style: female BPD patients whose attachment style changes from ambivalent to avoidant have shown better symptomatic results at the end of short-term therapy (31).

Although there is a great deal of interest in clinical applications of attachment theory, most clinical research in PDs is conceptual and case-study-based (117). For BPD, however, there has been more extensive research, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of published studies. The American Psychiatric Association’s guidelines for the treatment of BPD recommend psychotherapy as primary treatment, complemented by symptom-targeted pharmacotherapy (134). SSRIs are recommended for tackling emotional dysregulation and impulsivity, and antipsychotics are recommended for cognitive-perceptual symptoms. SSRIs could reduce HPA axis hyperactivation, contributing to the patient’s capacity to reflect on mental states without overreacting to them and thus facilitating psychotherapeutic interventions (45).

Mentalization is the process by which we make sense of each other and ourselves, implicitly and explicitly, in terms of subjective states and mental processes (135). Mental disorders in general can be seen as the mind misinterpreting its own experience of itself and therefore of others (136). The concept of mentalization is rooted in attachment theory. It postulates that one’s understanding of others depends on whether one’s own mental states were adequately understood by caring, attentive, nonthreatening adults. Problems in affect regulation and attentional control stemming from dysfunctional attachment relationships (40, 74, 137) are mediated through a failure to develop a robust mentalizing capacity (26, 64, 66, 71, 136, 138–142).

Under stressful conditions, and in the face of activation of their flawed attachment system, BPD patients temporarily lose their mentalization capacity, consequently misunderstanding social causality and showing cognitive and emotional dysregulation (26, 135, 140). MBT aims to stabilize the patient’s sense of self and help him/her maintain an optimal level of arousal in the context of a well-managed (i.e., neither too intense nor too detached) attachment relationship between patient and therapist (140, 143). The therapist must be aware of the hypersensitivity of such patients to interpersonal anxiety, which could overwhelm the patient’s mentalization capacity, putting the therapeutic relationship at risk (5, 136, 140, 144–146).

Despite MBT’s psychoanalytic origins, interventions are taken from various psychotherapeutic approaches. This plurality, together with the minimal amount of training and supervision necessary (147–150), makes MBT appealing to professionals from various orientations. MBT interventions are designed to stress the attachment relationship within controlled conditions and to lend special attention to the therapeutic relationship. For a detailed description of the techniques and therapeutic stance, we recommend reading the treatment manuals (143, 151).

Mentalization theory is now being applied to the treatment of numerous disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, antisocial PD, and depression) in a number of contexts (inpatient, partial hospitalization [38, 147–149] and outpatient [152]), and in different groups of patients (adolescents, families [153], and substance abusers [136]) (65). MBT has been manualized for PDs (143, 151) and been shown to be efficacious in RCTs (147–149, 152).

MBT for inpatients with severe BPD has been shown to be superior to routine general psychiatric care in improving depressive symptoms, decreasing suicidal and self-harm acts, reducing inpatient days, and improving social and interpersonal function. Improvements started 6 months into treatment and continued to increase to the end of the 18-month treatment (147). Follow-up every 3 months after the end of treatment showed that patients kept improving to 18 months (148). A further follow-up of the same study, 8 years after initial randomization, showed that MBT patients maintained their gains and showed better social and vocational status and less symptomatology than control subjects (149). The higher costs of implementing MBT were offset by less inpatient care during treatment and decreased service utilization during follow-up (154). In an outpatient setting, an RCT of MBT versus structured clinical management showed faster change for MBT patients in suicide attempts, severe self-harm incidents, self-reported interpersonal functioning, and psychiatric symptoms (152).

An 18-month, group-based MBT treatment for antisocial PD is currently being tested (38). Preliminary results show reduced self-reported aggression and reduced psychiatric symptomatology after the first 6 months of treatment. However, the authors warn about the difficulty of engaging these patients. Another unpublished study of MBT for antisocial PD is currently being carried out at a high-security hospital in England (38).

TFP is a manualized psychodynamic treatment for patients with BPD (155). It is based on both object-relations and attachment theories: representations of self and others, together with their affective valence, are derived from the internalization of attachment relationships with caregivers. The degree of differentiation and integration of these representations is disturbed in individuals with BPD (150, 156).

The primary goal of TFP is to reduce symptomatology and self-destructive behavior by modifying representations of self and others as they are enacted in the therapeutic relationship, and, ultimately, change the patient’s underlying personality organization. TFP is a structured treatment consisting of twice-weekly 45-minute sessions over 3 years. Its primary focus is on the predominant affect-laden themes that emerge in the therapeutic (transference) relationship, while monitoring the patient’s life outside sessions. The therapist uses techniques of clarification, confrontation, and transference interpretation (i.e., interpretation of the current patient-therapist interactions, which unveil the patient’s disparate perceptions of self and others including the therapist). In contrast to MBT, TFP considers interpretation as the route to integration of these disparate perceptions and representations, and activation of the attachment system is not avoided (124, 157). In turn, the integration of these representations and their concomitant emotions enables the development of a more complex capacity to think about the thoughts, feelings, intentions, and desires of self and others (i.e., mentalization) (158). This leads to increased modulation of affect, coherence of identity, greater capacity for intimate relationships, reduction in self-destructive behaviors, and general improvement in functioning (118, 150, 156).

TFP is well tolerated, and has positive outcomes in parasuicidal behaviors, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, hospital days, and global functioning (159). TFP in outpatient settings has shown to be more effective than treatment as usual (118), and its results are comparable to those of DBT (160) in suicidality after 1 year of treatment, and superior in outcomes of violence and irritability (161). After 3 years of treatment, studies show reductions in BPD symptoms and pathologic personality traits, and improvement of general quality of life (162, 163). TFP has also demonstrated structural changes in attachment and mentalization (118, 158).

Stemming from a cognitive-behavioral orientation, SFT conceptualizes BPD patients psychologically and emotionally as young children (164). Their inner world is understood as being formed by four pathologic self-schemas that have become fixed as a result of the interplay between genetic endowment and inappropriate parenting (165). These schemas are evident in BPD patients at different moments (71). Patients can act as detached protectors (showing emotional withdrawal and behavioral avoidance), punitive parents (self-harm), abandoned/abused children (frightened isolation), or angry/impulsive children (expressing rage directed toward those who did not meet their childhood emotional needs) (164). These same schemas exist in antisocial patients, together with the powerful presence of a “healthy adult” schema, an executive function for higher cognitive skills (166). SFT techniques are cognitive, behavioral, and experiential. The most important is “limited reparenting” by the therapist: the practitioner attempts to meet the patient’s unfulfilled emotional needs by being warm and sympathetic, self-disclosing, giving extra sessions and telephone or e-mail exchanges, or praising the patient. The idea is to develop a therapeutic relationship that is both a contrast and an antidote to the abusive relationships the patient experienced as a child, while maintaining professional and therapeutic boundaries (164, 165). Once this bond is achieved, cognitive techniques attempt to change unhealthy schemas and the patient is encouraged to practice new behaviors outside the session. SFT is a twice-weekly therapy lasting at least 2 years.

Outcomes of SFT have been found to be superior to TFP in reduction of borderline symptoms and general psychopathology and in quality of life improvement. SFT also showed lower dropout rates and better quality of therapeutic alliance (162, 167). SFT was also shown to be slightly more cost-effective than TFP (168). These results are limited due to several methodological flaws of the trial (150). Another study found that adding 8 months of group SFT to treatment as usual (individual psychotherapy) showed no dropout and increased the success rate from 16% to 94%. Symptomatic gains were maintained at 6-month follow-up (169). An ongoing trial of SFT with forensic patients presenting antisocial, borderline, narcissistic, and paranoid PDs has preliminarily shown good symptomatic outcomes and low attrition rates (170). SFT has also shown good outcomes in interpersonal problems in people diagnosed with agoraphobia and cluster C PDs (171).

Across pathologies, different treatments work for different subgroups. It could be argued that while MBT is a more generic approach that is optimal for BPD patients with multiple personality problems that might undermine focusing on specific attachment relationships, TFP and SFT are more focused, efficacious attempts at exploring particular significant interpersonal relationship representations.

Attachment theory overarches the psychological, psychiatric, social, and neuroscientific work on PDs. Its usefulness has been shown in the scientific field, and it is being translated into clinical settings. Practitioners can profit from the use of simple measures of attachment in order to tailor their interventions to maximize gains and minimize iatrogenic effects, which are all too common in the treatment of PDs (2, 19, 23, 29, 117, 122). Many mental health interventions have the potential to activate the attachment system of vulnerable patients but lack a structure to contain the emotional and behavioral consequences of the stress aroused, ranging from dropout to suicide (150, 167). Therefore, it is necessary to modify treatment settings in order to offer a “secure base” from which to start a curative change in relationship representations (136, 158, 172).

# Attachment Disorders | Causes, Types, Symptoms and Treatment

Children who have had breaks from their primary caregiver, unmitigated pain, abuse, neglect or in other ways have not had their needs met can often be impaired in their ability to develop healthy emotional attachments. This is currently called by many names, such as insecure attachment.  These less-than-healthy ways of attaching are often not diagnosed as disorders, but are common in children who have backgrounds of abuse or neglect or who are no longer with their biological parents, who have had the loss of one or more parents, who are in foster care, who have had several medical procedures or who have been adopted.  Attachment is on a spectrum – from healthy to insecure to disorganized (often diagnosed as an attachment disorder).  Some of the basic signs/characteristics that a person struggles with attachment are:

 

The children exhibiting the most severe symptoms are sometimes diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), or the newer diagnosis — Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED). All disorders/impairments of attachment are serious, because they impede the child’s emotional health and ability to have meaningful relationships.

How do emotional bonds in early life shape our ability to form and maintain relationships? Attachment disorders arise when these crucial bonds are disrupted, affecting emotional development and the capacity to connect with others. In this blog post, we will delve into the world of attachment disorders, exploring their causes, types, symptoms, and treatment options. By understanding the complexities of attachment disorders, we can better support those affected by them and foster healthier relationships.



Attachment disorders can be a significant obstacle in forming and maintaining healthy relationships. These disorders arise from negative experiences, such as neglect or inconsistent caregiving, during early childhood. Attachment issues can impact a person’s emotional development, making it challenging to form secure emotional bonds with others. Recognizing and addressing attachment disorders in infants and young children is crucial, as early intervention can lead to more positive outcomes.

A comprehensive understanding of attachment disorders requires familiarity with their definition, significance, and the foundational principles of attachment theory. We will examine these aspects in the following sections, shedding light on the complexities of attachment disorders and their impact on individuals and families.

Attachment disorders are conditions that hinder the formation of secure emotional bonds, affecting a person’s ability to form and maintain relationships. These disorders can have long-lasting effects on emotional and social well-being.

Healthy development is deeply rooted in secure emotional bonds that foster a sense of trust, safety, and emotional security. Grasping the definition and significance of attachment disorders paves the way for identifying and addressing these challenges in individuals and families.

Attachment theory, developed by British psychologist John Bowlby, emphasizes the importance of secure emotional bonds between infants and caregivers for healthy development. This theory explains how humans form and sustain attachments, and how these attachments influence emotional and social development.

Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) and Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED) are two distinct attachment disorders. Both can lead to difficulties in forming healthy relationships and social interactions. The causes of attachment disorders can be attributed to childhood neglect and abuse, inconsistent caregiving, and institutional settings and foster care.

A grasp of the principles underlying attachment theory underscores the importance of secure attachments and the potential ramifications of attachment disorders.



Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) and disinhibited social engagement disorder (DSED) are two primary attachment disorders. These conditions can have significant impacts on children’s lives. These disorders can significantly impact an individual’s emotional development and ability to form healthy relationships.

Subsequent sections delve into the specific traits of each attachment disorder and how they affect individuals and their families.

 

The DSM-5 gives the following criteria for Reactive Attachment Disorder:

A. A consistent pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behavior toward adult caregivers, manifested by both of the following:

 

B. A persistent social or emotional disturbance characterized by at least two of the following:

 

C. The child has experienced a pattern of extremes of insufficient care as evidenced by at least one of the following:

 

D. The care in Criterion C is presumed to be responsible for the disturbed behavior in Criterion A (e.g., the disturbances in Criterion A began following the lack of adequate care in Criterion C).

E. The criteria are not met for autism spectrum disorder.

F. The disturbance is evident before age 5 years.

G. The child has a developmental age of at least nine months.

Specify if Persistent: The disorder has been present for more than 12 months.

Specify current severity: Reactive Attachment Disorder is specified as severe when a child exhibits all symptoms of the disorder, with each symptom manifesting at relatively high levels.

 

Disinhibited social engagement disorder (DSED) involves over-friendliness with strangers, lack of distress when separated from caregivers, and little preference for trusted adults over unfamiliar individuals. Children with DSED display a lack of preference for their parents over other people, even strangers, and may seek comfort and attention from virtually anyone. They may not exhibit any distress when a parent is not present and may be overly familiar with strangers, yet have difficulty forming meaningful connections with others.

Factors such as childhood neglect and abuse, inconsistent caregiving, and experiences in institutional settings or foster care could potentially cause DSED.

The DSM-5 gives the following criteria for Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder:

A. A pattern of behavior in which a child actively approaches and interacts with unfamiliar adults and exhibits at least two of the following:

 

B. The behaviors in Criterion A are not limited to impulsivity (as in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) but include socially disinhibited behavior.

C. The child has exhibited a pattern of extremes of insufficient care as evidenced by at least one of the following:

 

D. The care in Criterion C is presumed to be responsible for the disturbed behavior in Criterion A (e.g., the disturbances in Criterion A began following the pathogenic care in Criterion C).

E. The child has a developmental age of at least nine months.

Specify if Persistent: The disorder has been present for more than 12 months.

Specify current severity: Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder is specified as severe when a child exhibits all symptoms of the disorder, with each symptom manifesting at relatively high levels.

 



Attachment disorders can be caused by various factors, including childhood neglect and abuse, inconsistent caregiving, and institutional settings or foster care. These factors can disrupt the development of secure emotional bonds, leading to attachment difficulties and challenges in forming and maintaining healthy relationships.

We will delve deeper into each of these factors in the sections that follow.

Neglect and abuse during childhood can lead to the development of childhood attachment disorder, as a young child struggles to form secure emotional bonds with caregivers. Children who have experienced neglect or abuse may have difficulty trusting others, controlling their emotions, and forming healthy relationships.

Furthermore, these early experiences can also have a detrimental effect on their self-esteem and lead to difficulties in social and emotional functioning. Providing the necessary support and therapy to individuals who have endured childhood neglect and abuse is important to mitigate the consequences and enhance their overall well-being.

Inconsistent caregiving can result in attachment disorders, as children are unable to develop a sense of security and trust in their caregivers. Children who experience inconsistent caregiving may display aberrant attachment behaviors, deficits in social-emotional development, and insecure attachment.

Insecure attachments may result in confusion, insecurity, and difficulties in forming healthy emotional relationships. Identifying and addressing issues of inconsistent caregiving can aid in preventing the onset of attachment disorders and foster the establishment of secure emotional bonds.

Children in institutional settings or foster care may be at a higher risk of developing attachment disorders due to frequent changes in caregivers and lack of consistent emotional support, especially for an infant or young child. These children may struggle to establish secure attachments, and the quality of attachment can be influenced by various risk factors.

Acknowledging the influence of institutional settings and foster care on attachment disorders can guide suitable interventions and support for impacted children.



Insecure attachment styles, which include anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant, or fearful-avoidant, can manifest in adults as different forms of attachment styles. These styles can significantly impact an individual’s emotional development and ability to form and maintain healthy relationships.

Subsequent sections will delve into each of these insecure attachment styles and their impact on individuals and relationships.

An anxious-preoccupied attachment involves:

 

Identifying and addressing issues related to anxious-preoccupied attachment can assist individuals in surmounting these challenges and fostering more secure emotional bonds.

Dismissive-avoidant attachment is characterized by:

 

Identifying and addressing issues related to dismissive-avoidant attachment can empower individuals to overcome these challenges and form more secure emotional bonds.

Fearful-avoidant attachment may lead to:

 

Identifying and addressing issues related to fearful-avoidant attachment can enable individuals to surmount these challenges and cultivate more secure emotional bonds.



Diagnosing attachment disorders involves assessing symptoms, using diagnostic criteria, and considering potential misdiagnoses and comorbid conditions. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for providing appropriate treatment and support for individuals with attachment disorders.

Subsequent sections will discuss the diagnostic criteria for attachment disorders, along with the potential risks and complications arising from misdiagnosis and co-existing conditions.

Diagnostic criteria for attachment disorders, as outlined in the DSM-5-TR, include:

 

These criteria focus on symptoms and behaviors related to emotional bonding and relationships.

Utilizing these criteria can help ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment for individuals with attachment disorders.

Misdiagnosis is possible, as attachment disorders can share symptoms with other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder. Comorbid conditions may also be present, complicating the diagnostic process.

A comprehensive medical history, evaluation of any co-existing conditions, and appropriate diagnostic techniques are necessary to minimize the risk of misdiagnosis. Accurate diagnosis is vital for providing proper treatment and support for individuals with attachment disorders.

Treatment approaches for attachment disorders include:

 

These approaches aim to help individuals with attachment disorders develop secure attachments, improve their emotional regulation, and enhance their relationship skills.

We will delve deeper into each of these treatment approaches in the sections that follow.

Therapy and counseling can help individuals with attachment disorders develop secure attachments and improve their emotional regulation and relationship skills. Various therapy approaches that can be utilized include:

 

These approaches can help individuals develop healthy attachment patterns and improve their relationships.

Professional guidance from a therapist, specializing in adolescents’ psychiatry, can offer invaluable support and direction for individuals with attachment disorders and their families.

Parenting skills classes can provide caregivers with the tools and strategies needed to support children with attachment disorders and foster healthy emotional bonds. These classes cover various topics, such as:

 

Participation in parenting skills classes can enhance caregivers’ understanding and ability to address the specific challenges faced by children with attachment disorders.



Medication and mental health support may be necessary for individuals with attachment disorders who also struggle with comorbid mental disorders, such as anxiety or depression. Antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, and mood stabilizers may be prescribed to help manage symptoms of these conditions.

In addition, therapeutic approaches can be utilized to help individuals with attachment disorders develop healthy attachment patterns and improve their relationships. It’s paramount for individuals with attachment disorders and their families to consult a mental health professional to determine the most effective treatment plan.

Coping strategies for individuals and families affected by attachment disorders involve building secure attachments, supporting emotional development, and navigating relationships. These strategies can help individuals with attachment disorders overcome challenges, develop trust and emotional security, and foster healthier connections with others.

Subsequent sections will delve into each of these coping strategies in greater detail.

Building secure attachments requires patience, consistency, and emotional support from caregivers, helping individuals with attachment disorders develop trust and emotional security. Responsive caregiving, emotional availability, positive reinforcement, consistency and predictability, physical affection, play and exploration, and open communication are all essential components of building secure attachments.

The development of secure attachments can enhance the emotional well-being of individuals with attachment disorders and facilitate the formation of healthier relationships.

Supporting emotional development involves:

 

These are essential components of supporting emotional development.

In addition, teaching coping skills, such as deep breathing and mindfulness, can help individuals with attachment disorders manage emotional difficulties and enhance their emotional well-being.

Navigating relationships for individuals with attachment disorders may require:

 

These strategies are essential for fostering healthy and fulfilling relationships.

Effective relationship management enables individuals with attachment disorders to overcome challenges and cultivate more secure emotional bonds with others.

In this blog post, we delved into the complexities of attachment disorders, exploring their causes, types, symptoms, and treatment options. We also discussed coping strategies for individuals and families affected by attachment disorders, emphasizing the importance of building secure attachments, supporting emotional development, and navigating relationships. By understanding and addressing attachment disorders, we can help individuals overcome the challenges they face and foster healthier, more fulfilling connections with others. Together, we can make a positive difference in the lives of those affected by attachment disorders.

The behaviors (symptoms) of attachment disorders can be very challenging to parent. Providing safety for these children and the rest of the family is a major concern. Families need continuous support and education to help these children heal.

Most professionals agree that attachment disorders are the result of early childhood trauma, so it’s important to understand how trauma affects a developing brain.

The APA further is recognizing that disorders of attachment are trauma-related and has designed a new category of Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorders, under which both attachment diagnoses will be found.

Links:

 

Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) and disinhibited social engagement disorder are the two attachment disorders recognized by the DSM-5, classified as trauma and stressor-related disorders.

Signs of attachment disorder include withdrawal, difficulty forming emotional connections, a lack of eye contact, limited communication skills, and difficulty expressing emotions.

Attachment disorders are typically diagnosed through a comprehensive examination including physical exams, lab tests, and psychiatric assessments conducted by a pediatrician or psychologist.

These assessments are used to determine the presence of an attachment disorder and to identify any underlying medical or psychological conditions that may be contributing to the disorder.

The treatment of attachment disorders is typically a combination of psychotherapy and medication.

Neglect and abuse, inconsistent caregiving, and living in institutional or foster care settings are the most common causes of attachment disorders.

Treatment for attachment disorders typically involves therapy, counseling, parenting skills classes and, in some cases, medication or mental health support.

These treatments are designed to help the child learn to form healthy attachments and develop better coping skills. They may also help the child better understand and manage their emotions. The goal is to help the child develop a secure environment.

	Attachment Disorders


No. 85; January 2017



Attachment Disorders are psychiatric illnesses that can develop in young children who have problems in emotional attachments to others. Parents, caregivers, or physicians may notice that a child has problems with emotional attachment as early as their first birthday.  Often, a parent brings an infant or very young child to the doctor with one or more of the following concerns:

Most children with attachment disorders have had severe problems or difficulties in their early relationships.  They may have been physically or emotionally abused or neglected.  Some have experienced inadequate care in an institutional setting or other out-of-home placement. Examples of out-of-home placements include residential programs, foster care or orphanage.  Others have had multiple traumatic losses or changes in their primary caregiver. The exact cause of attachment disorders is not known, but research suggests that inadequate care-giving is a possible cause. The physical, emotional and social problems associated with attachment disorders may persist as the child grows older.

Children who have attachment issues can develop two possible types of disorders: Reactive Attachment Disorder and Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder.

Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)

Children with RAD are less likely to interact with other people because of negative experiences with adults in their early years.  They have difficulty calming down when stressed and do not look for comfort from their caregivers when they are upset.  These children may seem to have little to no emotions when interacting with others.  They may appear unhappy, irritable, sad, or scared while having normal activities with their caretaker. The diagnosis of RAD is made if symptoms become chronic. 

Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED)

Children with DSED do not appear fearful when meeting someone for the first time.  They may be overly friendly, walk up to strangers to talk or even hug them.  Younger children may allow strangers to pick them up, feed them, or give them toys to play with.  When these children are put in a stranger situation, they do not check with their parents or caregivers, and will often go with someone they do not know.

Treatment

Children who exhibit signs of RAD or DSED need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. Treatment involves both the child and the family. Therapists focus on understanding and strengthening the relationship between a child and his or her primary care givers. Without treatment, these conditions can affect a child's social and emotional development. Treatments such as "rebirthing" strategies are potentially dangerous and should be avoided.

Parents of a young child who shows signs or symptoms of RAD or DSED should:

Reactive Attachment Disorder and Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder are serious clinical conditions.  However, close and ongoing collaboration between the child's family and the treatment team will increase the likelihood of a successful outcome.

The 5 conditions for secure attachment

“Hearts will never be practical until they are made unbreakable.”

There’s clearly an intentional irony to this quote from The Wizard of Oz; hearts weren’t designed to be unbreakable by nature. So in the midst of heartache, many of us behave far from practically.

Breakups often shake us to our core, cause us self-doubt, lower our self-esteem, and create a strong sense of failure or guilt. This reaction is down to the fact that most of us enter into a relationship with “forever” as the ultimate goal, so when a partnership ends, we typically mourn the loss of the person we cared about, as well as what “could have been.”

Yet, how we process our emotions in the aftermath of a breakup, the way we view our past relationships, and our ability to move on from them are dynamically impacted by our attachment styles.

So, how do the different attachment styles affect our ability to reflect on how we acted within a relationship, and move on from them healthily?

To answer this question, we will discuss:

Breakups, like any other stressful life event, can have a major impact on our mental health and well-being. As a result of heartbreak, we may experience issues such as depression, anxiety, sleep imbalances, and even feelings of grief. Of course, there are individual differences in how we cope and emotionally adjust in the aftermath of a breakup.

Many of us are aware of how our attachment styles can influence how we act within a relationship. Yet, not all of us credit them for how we cope with our emotions when relationships end.


There are four attachment styles: one secure and three insecure (avoidant, anxious, and disorganized).
According to Bowlby’s Attachment Theory, the attachment styles we personally develop depends on the bond we form with our caregivers in our early years. Essentially, how we connect with our caregivers shapes our understanding of ourselves and others and turns into a template for how we view the world and fit into it. This template (attachment style) influences our thoughts, feelings, and actions throughout our lifespans – including how we behave in (and after) relationships.
If our caregivers make themselves available to us as children and respond to our needs sensitively, then we likely develop a secure attachment. Comparatively, if caregivers are inconsistent, rejecting, or neglecting of our needs, we may develop an insecure attachment style. As adults, these attachment styles impact how we emotionally respond to life stressors – including breakups.

As adults, these attachment styles impact how we emotionally respond to life stressors – including breakups.

Breakups are hard on everyone – regardless of our attachment styles. However, because someone with a secure attachment grew up in an environment in which their needs were met, they felt safe, protected, and valued. Secure attachers have a positive outlook on themselves and others, and are able to manage their intense emotions in balanced, healthy ways.

For these reasons, in the direct aftermath of a breakup, although a secure attacher may be feeling heartache – especially if they weren’t the instigator of the breakup – their pain may be alleviated by their attachment style.


1. Prevent the breakup
Interestingly, people with the secure attachment style don’t experience as many breakups in general as do the other attachment styles.
This finding could be due to the fact that when a secure attacher senses that their partner may be considering ending the relationship, they typically don’t over or under-react. They have the ability to remain calm and talk through issues in the relationship with their partner. This ability to regulate emotions and demonstrate care and concern to their loved one may potentially even reduce the risk of the breakup in the first place.
2. Reach out for support when heartbroken
Yet, when a secure attacher does experience a breakup, they are typically aware of and able to communicate their feelings openly and honestly. Therefore, they are more likely to reach out to their family and friends for support in their times of need.
For this reason, although they may be feeling heartbroken, their distress is alleviated by their ability to communicate their needs to their support system.
3. Ditch the negative self-talk
Due to their solid foundations in life, secure attachers generally have more confidence in themselves – they believe that they are worthy of love. So, after a relationship ends, they are less likely to spiral into self-blame.
In fact, someone with a secure attachment style may be able to view the breakup objectively and see that there was a reason for it in the first place. Thus, they may be able to learn from why the relationship didn’t work out and apply their new knowledge to future connections.

Someone with an avoidant attachment style in relationships likely grew up with caregivers that they perceived to be rejecting of their need for intimacy and affection. In response to this sense of repeated rejection, the child ultimately shuts down their attachment system. Consequently, adults with an avoidant attachment style can come across as cold and aloof in romantic relationships. This reaction is due to the fact that they have a defensive mode in place which protects them from feeling rebuffed in their adult life.

However, this avoidance of emotional closeness also manifests in avoidant attachment breakup.

To begin with, avoidant attachers are more likely to instigate a breakup, as they typically prefer to keep relationships on a surface level and avoid confrontations with their partners.

However, regardless of whether they are the instigator of a breakup or not, avoidant attachers tend to repress or avoid expression of their intense emotions in the aftermath. This response isn’t to suggest that avoidant attachers don’t feel the pain of a breakup – they do. They’re just prone to pushing down their heartbreak and attempting to carry on with life as normal.

As a result of turning off their emotions, avoidant attachers are not likely to over-reflect on why a relationship didn’t work out.

Yet, interestingly, this reaction means that avoidant attachers may struggle to move on from previous relationships as quickly as they could if they had dealt with their emotions head-on.

Furthermore, as children, avoidant attachers created a positive self-view as a defense mechanism for their negative environment. As adults, this confident opinion of themselves can inhibit the ability to reflect honestly on personal downfalls within a relationship. Therefore, an avoidant attacher’s positive self-view can deprive them of the opportunity to grow in the aftermath of a breakup.

Intriguingly, avoidant attachers may only repress their upset and distress in the direct aftermath of a breakup. In contrast to anxious attachers, who typically brood and focus on why a relationship ended when it initially happens, avoidant attachers may only do so after considerable time has passed. This delayed brooding may impede an avoidant attacher’s willingness to meet new potential partners, as well as experience relationship satisfaction down the line.

Avoidant attachers may also engage in counterfactual thinking after time has passed since the breakup. This type of “if only” thinking may cause someone with this attachment style to wonder what might have been if only they had acted differently. However, for the most part, counterfactual thinking isn’t helpful, because the event has already occurred – therefore, it’s impossible to change it. Instead, it may benefit an avoidant attacher to try and learn from their previous actions and apply their newfound knowledge to current or future relationships.

In spite of the fact that avoidants may regret breaking up, they may regard their ex-partner negatively, and convince themselves that the breakup was their ex’s fault. Thus, they may talk themselves into thinking that the breakup was the best decision they ever made.

However, regardless of whether avoidant attachers regret a breakup or not, they’re still not likely to attempt to reestablish the relationship.

Due to the fact that someone with an avoidant attachment style is more likely to end a relationship because it’s starting to become serious, combined with their reluctance to re-establish a romantic connection, many people may be wondering how to get over an avoidant partner.

If you’re struggling in the aftermath of a breakup with an avoidant partner, the following steps may help you move on from the relationship:


Step #1: Assess your level of satisfaction within the relationship
Oftentimes, we’re prone to sticking with a relationship that isn’t technically working out, because it’s catering to some subconscious desire – such as that of feeling connected or attached to someone. However, if this is the case, then it’s likely that some – or many – of our needs weren’t being fulfilled by the partnership.
Before you jump into attempting to reestablish a connection with an ex, perhaps do a cost/benefit analysis of the relationship. Taking such a practical observation may reduce the intense emotions you may be feeling as a result of the breakup. Consider factors such as:


How much time your partner was willing to dedicate to you
Whether they were willing to be intimate and disclose emotions
If they were inclined to commit to you in the long term
And practical elements of the relationship such as age, occupation, and location


At the end of the exercise, you may be able to more clearly see how your ex wasn’t satisfying your needs.

Before you jump into attempting to reestablish a connection with an ex, perhaps do a cost/benefit analysis of the relationship. Taking such a practical observation may reduce the intense emotions you may be feeling as a result of the breakup. Consider factors such as:

At the end of the exercise, you may be able to more clearly see how your ex wasn’t satisfying your needs.


Step #2: Avoid contact with your avoidant ex
This isn’t some manipulative strategy designed to get your avoidant ex’s attention. Instead, it’s to bring awareness to how you may manage breakups based on your own attachment style. For example, if you’re high in attachment anxiety, then you’re prone to attempts at reestablishing the relationship. However, doing so may place you in a vicious cycle of reunion and rejection, so it’s best to reflect on why the relationship ended and move on with your life.
Step #3: Process your feelings
Secure attachers process their heartache by discussing their intense feelings with their family and trusted friends. If you wish to get over your avoidant ex, then it may be necessary for you to explore your emotions by discussing them with someone you trust. In some instances, you may find that therapy is the best avenue for you to process how you’re feeling after a breakup.

Someone with an anxious attachment style likely grew up in an environment where intimacy and affection were given inconsistently. Thus, as an adult, an anxious attacher will do everything in their power to be close and intimate with a romantic partner. They require affection and emotional affinity so as to feel safe and secure in a relationship. In turn, this need also affects anxious attachment breakups.


1. Sensitivity towards relationship threats
Even before a breakup actually occurs, someone with anxious attachment in relationships may be more sensitive to the fact that it’s impending as they’re prone to any indications of abandonment or rejection from their partner.
Moreover, picking up on these issues in the relationship may create further conflict and drive it towards its end.
2. Intense negative reactions when a relationship ends
After a breakup, someone with the anxious attachment style often feels intense pain and longing for their ex-partner. This reaction is due to their attachment system being activated by feelings of abandonment and rejection. Therefore, it is even more intense in cases where the anxious attacher wasn’t the instigator of the breakup.
This highly negative response may even lead to depressive symptoms and anxiety in the immediate aftermath of a breakup. So, the anxious attacher often responds to breakups by attempting to restore their feelings of safety and security.

3. Urge to get back together with the ex
The anxious attacher may feel like ending the relationship was unwarranted. Therefore, they may try to figure out ways to get back together with their partner and restore the attachment bond. However, doing so often leads to cycles of making up and breaking up.
What’s more, not only might the anxious attacher experience a loss of identity as they may be willing to change who they are in an attempt to coerce their partner into reuniting, but it also reduces their chances of being able to move on with their lives and establish a relationship in which they feel safe and secure.
4. Rumination & jealousy
Anxious attachers are prone to preoccupation with why the breakup occurred in the first place. Although this is quite a common reaction for most people, anxious attachers may struggle to get past this stage and their hypervigilant behaviors and anxious attachment jealousy may even be triggered. As a result, they experience intense distress and may even be prone to jealous and aggressive behavior towards their ex-partner.
The anxious attacher may also overanalyze their own behavior during the relationship, as well as that of their ex-partner, in an attempt to find answers to why the breakup occurred in the first place.
Having said as much, there actually are positives to how an anxious attacher handles breakups…

The anxious attacher may also overanalyze their own behavior during the relationship, as well as that of their ex-partner, in an attempt to find answers to why the breakup occurred in the first place.

Having said as much, there actually are positives to how an anxious attacher handles breakups…

Many people report the negatives after a breakup with a romantic partner; prolonged feelings of upset, difficulties sleeping, intense emotions such as sadness and anger, taking care of ourselves less, and an overall decline in life satisfaction are common reactions.

However, not many people discuss the potential positives of a relationship ending – but there’s much to suggest that there’s truth to Frederich Nietzsche’s adage: “That which does not kill us makes us stronger,” as those of us high in attachment anxiety may be able to evolve for the better after a breakup in contrast to those high in attachment avoidance.

People high in attachment anxiety appear to be able to see the silver linings of a breakup and are thus able to grow from the experience. This personal growth may be due to how anxious attachers emotionally respond in the direct aftermath of a breakup:

An anxious attacher’s enhanced distress after a breakup promotes brooding and reflection on the relationship and why it ended, potentially offering them a sense of insight into what went wrong and why. Their tendency towards low self-esteem and negative self-perceptions may cause the anxious attacher to blame themselves for the breakup and potentially motivate them towards positive change. In other words, an anxious attacher’s intense focus on their personal downfalls and how they affected their relationship may help them confront their issues and process them.

People high in attachment anxiety may be able to move on from past relationships quicker than those high in attachment avoidance.

After anxious attachers process their distress, they typically feel emotionally capable of rebounding into another relationship. This new experience often allows them to establish a renewed sense of connectedness and security, as well as focus on something other than “pining” over their ex. However, it may take some time before an anxious attacher feels emotionally ready to rebound.

Anxious attachers are more likely to experience future romantic success after a breakup.It may also be the case that anxious attachers experience future relationship satisfaction and personal success as a result of the breakup experience. Their fear of subsequent relationship failure may encourage them to develop skills that allow them to maintain future relationships more successfully and, therefore, increase the likelihood that they will experience long, stable, and happy relationships down the line.

A disorganized attachment is rooted in a childhood of perceived fear. In some cases, a child may have experienced neglect, abuse, or trauma or perhaps witnessed their caregiver acting this way towards others. Either way, the disorganized attacher struggled to make sense of their caregiver’s actions – they simultaneously desired love and affection from them, while also fearing what the caregiver was capable of.

Adults with a disorganized attachment style tend to continue to struggle to understand the way other people behave. Consequently, the disorganized attacher lacks a coherent approach to how they act around their romantic partners; they often seek out affection and intimacy, and then push it away as soon as it is offered.

This lack of consistent behavior is also evident in disorganized attachment breakups.

By nature, someone with a disorganized attachment typically swaps between the traits of the anxious and avoidant attachment styles depending on their current mood and circumstances, for this reason, it is not always possible to identify the stages of disorganized break up.

Thus, someone with a disorganized attachment style may be prone to strong feelings of distress, anxiety, and even depressive symptoms after a breakup. However, they are also capable of bottling up these feelings and closing themselves off from others – but this may be an important defensive strategy for the disorganized attacher. Ultimately, a disorganized attacher may struggle to reflect on what happened within the relationship that led to the breakup, so they may accept the outcome passively.

However, depending on the extent to which a disorganized attacher falls on the dimensions of anxious and avoidant attachment, they may be able to positively grow from a breakup.

If the disorganized attacher allows themself to brood and reflect on the issues in their previous relationship, they may develop a sense of insight into their actions. If they deem themselves to be responsible for the breakup (which their low self-esteem may cause them to), then they may be able to alter their patterns of behavior for the better in future relationships.

Therefore, the disorganized attacher may be more likely to experience success in future relationships.

When it comes to disorganized attachment, there really isn’t a “one size fits all” approach. Therefore, if someone with a disorganized attachment is struggling with their intense emotions after a breakup, or else feeling strangely “flat,” it’s important that they process their heartbreak in a way that suits them best.

Seeking professional help, talking to a trusted loved one, or engaging in activities that help them to connect with who they truly are at their core may help a disorganized attacher to recognize the patterns in their behavior. Furthermore, doing so may help them create strategies that prevent the past from repeating itself and facilitate healthy, supportive future relationships.


Regardless of whether we are more prone to an anxious- or avoidant-driven response to a breakup, it’s important to recognize our patterns in the aftermath of a relationship ending if we wish to grow from the experience. Self-reflection, as well as allowing ourselves to grieve for the loss of a relationship, may promote positive change in our lives, as well as increase our chances of future relationships and personal satisfaction.

# The Anxious Attachment Style and Breakups: How to Handle Them (A Guide)

Are you currently in the midst of a painful breakup and looking for a way to heal?

If you’re insecurely attached, breakups can be hard. And that’s especially true for anxious attachment breakups. 

Let’s get to the bottom of the source of this emotional turmoil and find out how we can use it as a healing tool!

What is your attachment style?

>>TAKE THE QUIZ<<

People with an anxious attachment style generally want a lot of closeness in their relationships. They want it quickly and they want it unconditionally.

I like to refer to these people as ‘Open Hearts’.

The Open-Hearted attachment style is just one of four relationship attachment styles, with the other three being: secure, avoidant (‘Rolling Stones’), and disorganized (‘Spice of Lifers’). We’ll discuss some of these later.

Of these four attachment styles, three are the so-called insecure ones. While all four develop in early childhood, the childhood of a person with an insecure attachment style is generally characterized by the lack of a secure, stable bond with caregivers and not having one’s needs met.

According to psychologist John Bowlby, the inventor of the attachment style theory, these early-life dynamics shape us in fundamental ways, influencing how we approach all later relationships in our lives.

We now have an idea of what creates anxious attachment, so, let’s delve deeper into what it is.

Do you often walk on eggshells, hoping to please a partner? Perhaps feeling like you’re pouring everything into a relationship? Or do you have a tendency to feel extremely attracted to emotionally unavailable people? Does the mere thought of remaining alone scare the hell out of you? And do you often look outside yourself for approval and validation?

If you answered “yes” to most of these questions, that could be an indication that you might have an Open-Hearted attachment.

An insatiable hunger for love and affection is typical of an Open Heart. This is in part because they often experience deep feelings of unworthiness. So, they hope that someone will come along, love them deeply, and remove all these negative, unwanted feelings.

At the beginning of a relationship, this may even seem to work. The newness of a fresh romance can be so exhilarating that an Open Heart finally gets to forget about their typical worries. Even if just for a bit.

Sooner or later, however, the doubts tend to come back with a vengeance as worrying about attracting a partner shifts to worrying about keeping your partner.

Because of this, an Open Heart can become increasingly vigilant and sensitive to any negative emotional cues as time goes by.



Connection, closeness, and intimacy. That is what an Open Heart desires. But is it also what they necessarily find attractive?

Not always. Because despite the Open Heart’s yearning for intimacy, vulnerability also scares them. They might have experienced being told that “they are just too much” one too many times, so, to win a partner’s love, they can develop ways of hiding certain parts of themselves that they deem unattractive or undesirable. Unfortunately, this not only complicates being your true, authentic self, but it also leads to a certain disconnect. Both from yourself and others.

Open Hearts usually develop intense crushes very quickly. This is not entirely surprising. After all, a crush often has much more to do with one’s fantasy than anything else.

A crush is exciting and fun. It allows you to feel strong emotions for someone without necessarily having to deal with the ‘scarier’ sides of a relationship, like true intimacy. Without even really knowing who the other person is, you can feel a strong bond and relish in all the lovely feelings and fantasies that go along with it.

As long as someone is able to also (eventually) see the person in front of them, stripped away of all the fantasies and expectations, this tendency to develop strong crushes early on does not necessarily mean relationship doom. What is advisable not to get into, however, is the anxious-avoidant trap.

The anxious-avoidant trap refers to the rollercoaster cycle of an unhealthy, push-pull relationship.

As people with an anxious attachment style tend to feel attracted to those with an avoidant attachment style (the so-called ‘Rolling Stones’), and vice versa, this trap is quite common.

The cyclical pattern can be summarized like this: The Open Heart seems to want far too much, the Rolling Stone far too little. Yet when the Open Heart reaches a breaking point and decides to call it quits, the Rolling Stone is pulled back in again.

This could either be because the low ‘danger’ of reciprocation makes the Rolling Stone feel safer or because they admire the Open Heart’s new-found strength and independence. But either way, unless things fundamentally change, the cycle is likely to repeat itself.

As the Open Heart starts pouring in all their love and energy again, the Rolling Stone, once again, feels uneasy and unsafe. The words ‘needy’ and ‘cold’ are thrown around. And the anxious-avoidant trap remains in full force.

Now, why are those with anxious attachment drawn to those with avoidant attachment style and vice versa?

Well, we tend to behave in ways that validate and reinforce our attachment models. Of course, this usually happens unconsciously so most of the time we are not even aware of it.

For example, Open Hearts frequently pair with partners who ultimately won’t give them what they want, namely long-lasting closeness and intimacy.

Because Open Hearts can experience deep-rooted feelings of unworthiness, they generally like a challenging partner who makes them work for it. They can spend months, if not years, chasing someone, hoping to ‘win’ over their love and prove to them (and also themselves) that they are worthy. That they are, in essence, lovable. A feeling that they never experienced much during childhood.

Yet, by chasing someone unattainable, you do the complete opposite. Instead of feeling lovable, you constantly feel like you are unlovable, thus validating your own deepest fear.

A breakup is often an Open Heart’s worst fear. So, how do anxious attachment handle breakups?

They can experience extreme feelings of unworthiness and despair. And because they feel incapable of fending for themselves in the face of emotional adversity, they are prone to engage in unhealthy, numbing behavior. Together with a tendency to ruminate, this usually only further worsens the emotional turmoil they are already in.

In contrast, while someone with an avoidant attachment is just as likely to behave in unhealthy coping behavior after a painful breakup, this is done in a slightly different way. They generally ruminate less than an Open Heart and will instead do everything they can not to think of their ex-partner too much. Sometimes even outright ghosting their ex.

If you like the idea of me doing a video or blog post on how different attachment styles deal with breakups, then make sure to let me know in the comments!

While everyone deals with a breakup differently, and every breakup in itself is also unique, there are usually a few breakup stages that someone with an anxious attachment style goes through. Let’s explore this further.

Because an Open Heart is so scared of losing a partner’s love and affection, they tend to be hypervigilant of any negative signs. They have a sort of ‘spidey sense’ that allows them to notice the tiniest of shifts. Even before a breakup actually occurs. In and of itself, this can be a good thing. After all, noticing issues early on can be favorable for everyone involved.

When these doubts can’t be brought up in a healthy, constructive way, however, it often only further worsens the situation.

For example, if an Open Heart feels like something is off and finds that their partner does not reassure them enough, they may exhibit protest behavior (so-called anxious attachment protest behavior). This includes things such as withdrawing, excessive calling or texting, manipulation, trying to make the partner jealous, threats, hostility, etc.

While the goal is to reestablish contact with the partner and pull them in closer again, it often ends up doing the exact opposite. Pushing the partner even further away.

A breakup feeds into an Open Heart’s fears and greatly triggers their attachment system. This is especially true when the separation was instigated from the ex-partner’s side.

After a breakup, Open Hearts often deal with intense pain and an extreme desire to see their ex-partner again. They feel abandoned, unloved, undesirable, rejected. And besides their initial anxiety, they may experience severe depressive symptoms. 

Life feels meaningless. And the thought of waking up each day without this partner by their side can seem like torture. Numerous painful feelings can be felt, ranging from anger and shame to intense sadness and despair.

While friends and family may be able to provide support, the Open Heart’s reactions might seem slightly exaggerated to them. And because Open Hearts often haven’t developed effective or healthy self-soothing practices yet, they can feel extremely overwhelmed by it all. Sometimes reaching for unhealthy tools to try and alleviate their pain.

Because the pain of a breakup is often so immense, an Open Heart tends to have a strong urge to get back together with their ex, hoping that this will restore a feeling of safety.

They are prone to putting their ex and the relationship as a whole on a pedestal, focusing on all the great parts while overlooking the more negative sides.

With each passing moment, the breakup looks more and more like a terrible mistake. One that should be corrected as soon as possible!

They might start reading endless articles and books on How to win an ex back, fantasizing about how beautiful things could be if they just had another chance together. This immense doubt and fantasizing can also happen even if the Open Heart was the instigator of the breakup. 

To reduce the agony, they would basically do almost anything to get back together again. This often includes making many, many promises about how they would change. While this might work to convince a partner to reunite, it can also cause a certain loss of self. Especially when it seems like the Open Heart is the only one in the relationship who would be willing to make such big changes.

Anxious attachment, rumination, and jealousy often go hand in hand. After a breakup, this is all the more noticeable.

If attempts to get back together fail, the Open Heart might experience intense feelings of jealousy and anger. Imagining their partner moving on can be extremely painful and bring up many difficult emotions.

Rumination is also common. They overanalyze everything that ever happened. Not only during the breakup but also during the entire relationship. From start to finish.

While self-reflection is a very good thing, rumination usually only leads to even more distress. And because Open Hearts might still be putting their exes on a pedestal, they might be overly focused on all of their own perceived wrongdoings.

So, they mull over everything they supposedly did wrong, believing that things could have been so much better had they just done this or that differently.

What they often do not realize is that relationships are meant to be a two-way street. You can’t save a broken relationship on your own. No matter how hard you are willing to try.

While every breakup process is unique, knowing what your triggers are can greatly help in dealing with it in a healthier way. Understanding where your pain is coming from is a crucial step toward healing. It helps you see things with more clarity and prevents you from staying stuck in your pain.

Any signs of potential abandonment or rejection greatly trigger an Open Heart. It taps into their fear of being left alone and reinforces their worries about being unlovable.

Now, what happens when anxious attachment is triggered?

Triggers are essentially semi-automatic gut reactions. They are not very rational and can bring up a well of intense emotions.

Listening to our gut feelings is important. But knowing how to distinguish our defensive or overprotective instincts from our healthier intuition is perhaps even more crucial.

For example, does the immense urge to get back with your partner stem from an intuitive knowing that this is the right relationship for you? Or may it also be somewhat driven by old emotional needs and fears and a desire to cling to a harmful but familiar sense of identity? One in which you are not fully seen or heard, and are instead fighting for the other person’s love and approval?

In this video, I discuss in more detail how you can decode your own triggers and learn to work with their deeper wisdom:



There’s no clear-cut plan to get over breakup pain. But there are some useful tips that can make the process as healthy and healing as possible:

Let go of the fantasy

However hard it may seem, try to keep a realistic view of the past. Don’t put your ex on a pedestal and also don’t demonize yourself. Living in the present is a beautiful gift that we usually don’t practice often enough. What are some things that could ground you in the present and reduce rumination?

No contact

Doing no contact with anxious attachment is not easy, but it can bring so many benefits. Important, however, is that you do it for YOU! Sure, it may make your ex miss you more, but that should not be the main goal.

Process the four crucial emotions

During the breakup process, four crucial emotions must be experienced: anger, sadness, fear, and grief. Take a look at this video, to know why these are so important: 



Allow yourself to move one

Allowing yourself to truly move on can be extremely cathartic for an Open Heart. And embracing wonder can help with this. After all, an inability to let go often also has to do with a fear of the unknown. 



Now, before you fervently start looking for things such as: “Can you heal anxious attachment?” Or “How do you overcome attachment issues after a breakup?” Just know that an anxious attachment brings with it many positives. Not only during the relationship but also afterward.

As mentioned earlier, a tendency to ruminate generally also indicates a high level of reflection. And due to feeling heartbreak so intensely, a breakup often serves as a catalyst for transformation for Open Hearts. 

With that being said, wanting to feel a little less like you’re lost at sea, drowning in your emotions, is also completely normal. Change is possible, and moving towards a more secure attachment style can happen! And yes, research literally backs this up.

So, if you would like to learn about things such as how to break free from anxious attachment or how to calm down anxious attachment, then I have lots of tools and sources to help you out!

The first step is to figure out your own attachment style. Take my free quiz here to do so:

With that being said, let’s never forget that you are also perfectly okay the way you are right now. In fact, desperately trying to heal all the time actually keeps us wounded in many ways.

That was it for today, now you know what anxious attachment breakups look like. 

Breakups can be incredibly hard. This is true for everyone, but perhaps even more for an Open Heart. While the emotional turmoil can seem so painful, eventually, it can also help us emerge as stronger and more whole human beings.

Do you have any other questions about what anxious attachment feels like during a breakup? What coping mechanisms do you rely on while dealing with a breakup? Would you label these as healthy? Or would you rather develop some new ones?

# Healing From a Breakup With Anxious Attachment | Well+Good



The concept of attachment styles, of which there are four (secure, anxious, avoidant, and disorganized), stems from attachment theory, which says that the relationship you had with your caregiver(s) as an infant and young child informs how you will connect with others in your adult life. Though it’s not a new concept, attachment theory is having a moment on TikTok (the hashtag #attachmentstyles has over 24 million views), as more people turn to the framework to better understand their love life and how they approach and act within relationships… and during breakups.

People with an anxious attachment style, in particular, experience frequent anxiety about potential abandonment, typically due to early childhood experiences with a caregiver who didn’t (or didn’t reliably) meet their emotional needs. As a result, they often seek reassurance from a partner1 that they still like them and want to be with them.

In grappling with my own attachment issues, I've found myself worrying about what my current or potential partners were doing when we were apart, questioning their feelings for me and whether they shared my vision for our future, and essentially waiting to see if they would leave me. It’s no wonder, then, that the eventual breakups sent me spiraling.

“A breakup activates our survival response and triggers our abandonment wound, which can make us feel like we won’t ‘survive’ the breakup.” —Tana Espino, LMFT, psychotherapist

“Attachment is about survival, it develops in infancy, and that gets triggered during breakups if we haven’t healed into a more securely attached system,” says psychotherapist and somatic coach Tana Espino, LMFT. “A breakup activates our survival response and triggers our abandonment wound, which can make us feel like we won’t ‘survive’ the breakup.”

 {{post.sponsorText}} 

Below, experts share why a breakup hits differently when you have an anxious attachment style and their best advice for making it through. No matter how difficult it may feel if you’re in the wake of your own breakup, it’s important to remember: You’re not alone, and there is hope.

Breakups can be difficult for anyone, but “people with an anxious attachment style often experience breakups more intensely2 compared to those with other attachment styles,” says Amy Chan, author of Breakup Bootcamp and host of the Breakup Bootcamp podcast. After all, those who have an anxious attachment style have a predilection for feeling abandoned or neglected based on early childhood experiences—which can make breakups feel that much more destabilizing when they happen. And the tendency of anxiously attached people to connect their own sense of identity and self-worth with the validation of a partner can further worsen the experience of a breakup, says Chan.

That's certainly been true for me. My sense of self-esteem absolutely plummeted when each of my past relationships ended because I had come to base my worth on how much my partner loved me. Whenever one of my partners decided to end things, I felt like I had lost everything—because I had made him my everything. As is typical for anxious attachment, I had let my other relationships with friends and family members fall the wayside and even sacrificed hobbies to focus solely on the relationship and the validation I gained from it, leaving me with seemingly nothing in its wake.

Processing such big feelings of loss or rupture can send the nervous system into overdrive, says Espino, leading someone with an anxious attachment style to react with a fight-or-flight response. “They may start to do whatever is in their power to maintain the connection,” says Espino, “even at the expense of their own needs and values.” This reaction can trigger some irrational and ill-advised decisions, like begging your partner to stay, changing things about your appearance to see if it’ll change their mind, or using physical intimacy as a last-ditch effort to maintain some form of connection with them.

As the saying goes, time heals all wounds. If you struggle with anxious attachment, though, the process of healing from a breakup may take you more time and energy than it would for people who are securely attached, but it will be well worth it in the end. Use these tips to embark on that journey:

As tempting as it may be, checking up on your ex’s Instagram or hanging around their favorite local coffee shop and hoping to “run into” them won’t do you any good. (Trust me, I’ve been there, and it never helps.) Rather than keeping yourself in close proximity to the person or situation that has caused you so much pain, Chan says that going no-contact is critical to the healing process.

“This step is crucial because continued interaction can reinforce the neural pathways associated with your ex, making it harder for your brain to adapt to the new reality of the breakup,” says Chan. “By cutting off contact, you enable the process of synaptic pruning, which is the brain's way of eliminating unnecessary neural connections, facilitating healing, and moving on.”

Ruminating on the breakup, why it happened, and what your ex is experiencing or thinking rarely helps. Instead, such overthinking can become a vicious cycle that prolongs your suffering and delays the healing process further, says Chan. “Mind-reading, catastrophizing, and making assumptions about how little they are feeling the impact of the breakup are all cognitive distortions which amplify stress and anxiety,” she explains. “Even if your ex had a secure or avoidant attachment style, chances are, they are processing the grief, too, in their unique way.”

“Because a breakup activates our [nervous] system, we need to focus on getting back into a more regulated state and feeling more secure within,” says Espino. To do that, she suggests engaging in somatic work.

That can look like breathwork, meditation, yoga, or even dancing—any physical way you can start to reconnect with your body and ground yourself in self-love and compassion.

Not sure where to start? Try this yoga-for-heartbreak flow:

﻿

In my own past breakups, I’ve often come to realize just how much time and energy I had invested into my relationship with my former partner—often at the expense of my connections with my friends and family. Weeks or even months would go by where I ignored texts from my girlfriends asking to hang out or forgot to call my mom back, all because I was completely engrossed in the person I was dating. It wasn’t until after a breakup happened that I would realize how important it was to have people in my sphere beyond a partner.

When you’re dealing with anxious attachment during a breakup, leaning on your support system can help remind you that you’re not being abandoned or left alone, and that you are still loved and appreciated. Chan recommends reaching out to those in your life who won’t judge you and will hold space for you to express and process your feelings.

It’s also a good idea to share with them the ways in which you'd like to be supported. “Let them know that you would like a listener who offers empathy rather than advice,” suggests Chan. “Since not everyone knows how to support someone who's grieving, it's important to guide them on how best they can assist you.”

Choosing not to think about your ex or the breakup is often easier said than done, but it’s important to make sure that this former relationship doesn’t occupy all of your present mental and emotional space. (I can say with experience that listening to sad music and scrolling through old pictures of you and your ex won't do you any favors.)

Instead of giving into self-punishment, engaging in new activities that will distract you from the breakup can help remind you that there are better things on the horizon. “Whether it's learning a new skill, meeting new people, or traveling to new places, these experiences help your brain evolve and adapt, reducing the dominance of neural pathways linked to your ex,” says Chan. “This approach effectively reshapes your neural landscape, aiding in the recovery process.”

A few ideas? You can set up a standing movie night with your friends, meet up with your coworkers for happy hour, or try a new workout class in your area. Even starting a new ritual or routine, like taking long walks with your dog every morning or checking out a weekly farmer’s market, can help you build a new life and positive reality without your ex. “It’s okay to have healthy distractions while we are healing from a breakup, in order to bring ourselves more ease,” says Espino.

Breakups generally suck for most folks, but for those of us with an anxious attachment style, that shit can be absolutely soul-crushing. I’d like to share a bit about why this could be.

One of my last breakups was particularly instructive. At the time, I was already years deep into therapy and recovery from codependency and various addictions. I honestly don’t recall who initiated the split or if it was a mutual decision, but I crumbled into a pile of dust nonetheless.

I’m type 1 diabetic, and I’m here to tell you that my body was literally shutting down. Diagnosed as a wee lad, managing the illness is second nature to me. Yeah, it can be a pain in the ass, but it’s seldom ever challenging.

After this breakup, I felt like my whole digestive system (and all of my internal organs, including my heart for that matter) had been removed from my body. Like I wasn’t even a biological organism anymore. I was a ghost.

I just so happened to be doing a test trial on a continuous glucose monitor that week. So instead of testing my blood sugar with finger sticks eight times a day, I could simply look at this pager device and see exactly…

# A Conversation with The Breakup Therapist — heirloom counseling

Hello!

Y’all, I am so excited about the blog this week. As a proponent of healthy relationships, I am also a proponent of healthy breakups—because breakups are part of the relationship continuum. Sometimes after digging into the personal and relationship work, we might realize that we have come to the end of a partnership (note: this comes back to the idea that the work in relationships may not have the outcome we were hoping for). This realization can be painful or liberating or unimaginable (or any combination of those emotions) and to me, it’s really important that we navigate this part of the relationship in a way that allows for dignity for ourselves and our partner. 

I reached out to Lindsey Brock, LCSW aka The Breakup Therapist. Lindsey is skilled in navigating all the different aspects of breakups and as you will learn through this interview, attachment theory plays a huge role in how we approach, endure, and rebuild our lives after the end of a relationship.

I’m so grateful to Lindsey for her thoughtful (and often humorous) responses to my many questions. 

Lindsey, hi! Can you tell us about yourself and what you do in the world?

Hi! I'm Lindsey. I'm a therapist in Asheville, North Carolina and I see folks in my private practice who need some extra support in their relationships. I absolutely love working with people who feel like they don't know who they are outside of a relationship. Often, folks come to me on the verge of a breakup, or shortly after it, searching to find out who they are without this person. Spoiler alert: I like doing this work because I've been there. It's so fun to help people nurture their identity totally unrelated to who they're dating.

I've put myself out into the world as 'the breakup therapist,' but of course, not everybody I work with is going through a breakup! But there is a common thread woven through the work of most of my clients: folks are wanting more out of their life and more out of their partnerships. A bit more about me and the work I do: I also have a coaching practice that is online-based, where I operate as a relationship and breakup coach to support people in making healthier and more grounded decisions in that realm of their lives. 

Can you share some of your observations about breakups in general?

Something I've noticed is that even though I call myself "the breakup therapist”, folks come to me stating other reasons for seeking out therapy. This often sounds like “I'm here to work on my anxiety or to better manage stress”. But usually, two or three sessions in, I hear about a devastating relationship, unresolved relationship trauma, or the uncertainty that is plaguing them day and night about the current state of their relationship (usually, “do I stay or go?” or “why do I keep dating assholes?!?!”). I think it's so hard to name the pain that often comes with hard relationships or the end of really important relationships. I mean, we as humans are wired for this stuff. So understandably, people don't want to face the pain and sometimes try to avoid it. But it's so important to face the hard stuff.

When I started my practice, I assumed I would be helping a lot of people get over the grief of a breakup, but a lot of the work that I do is to help folks understand whether or not they want to remain in the relationship. Our attachment wounds, our relationship trauma, and our anxieties can really complicate a decision around whether or not to stay in a relationship. My job is to help people clear away all the muck that is muddying the waters and making it harder for them to make a decision. Let's heal those wounds so you can make an autonomous decision—not one filtered through trauma or unattended attachment wounds.

What are the reasons people stay in long-term relationships when they aren’t working?

I really try to challenge folks to consider the reasons that they're staying or reasons they want to leave. A lot of this is about attachment. I want to help people make decisions that are not rooted in fear, hurt, or trauma. I often hear these reasons for staying:

“No one else could ever love me” (often, an ex or current partner has told them this bullshit), or some other version of “I don't want to be alone.”

“We've been together so long/there's so much invested in our relationship already.” I call this the gas station theory. Let’s pretend a hurricane is coming. You've waited in line for gas for 2 hours at a gas station. They keep swearing the gas is on its way, but it hasn’t showed up yet. Someone drives by and says, “Hey! They have gas one mile down the road at another station! And plenty of it!” But you stay in line because you've already waited 2 hours. This makes no sense. Go get you some gas!

“I don't know what it would be like without this person in my life; that's too scary to consider.”

“I always date assholes and this is the best I'm going to get, so I may as well stick around.”

These reasons are not great reasons to stay in a relationship. They're rooted in fear of the unknown or lies people have told us (or we have told ourselves) over the years. I challenge these types of beliefs on the reg. 

Alternatively, people choose to leave for not-so-healthy reasons (usually because of attachment or trauma wounds). This often occurs when people have a really hard time having the difficult conversations or feeling the uncomfortable feelings. So when things get hard, people bail (or often these days, they ghost). Recognizing our patterns, taking the time to heal our trauma and the things that have helped shape our attachment styles will put us back in control of our choices.

Can you give us some tips about how to end a relationship with as much respect as possible?

This is a tough question. My first thought was, 'respect for whom?’ The individual, or their soon to be ex-partner? Rarely are breakups easy, but some are a little more straightforward than others. For the more cordial breakups, consider the following:

Be direct. Rip off the band-aid. Your partner may or may not have any idea this conversation is about to happen, but will likely at some point experience some intense anxiety or pain. Although tough to say and to hear, being direct is the best way forward.

If it's emotionally safe to have a conversation, provide space for your partner. But remember, you're saying "you aren't my person anymore." Try not to take on the role you've previously played. I've heard lots of folks say that it's confusing to have someone end the relationship, then immediately apologize profusely/provide physical comfort/act like you would if you're still partnered.

Do not say anything that is untrue. This may include "maybe later in life we can be together" or "I want to still be friends." If you know you don't feel that way, don't say it. Being honest shows you and your partner the most respect. 

A lot of breakups that lead people to seek therapy are not as straightforward. They're complicated and layered. When ending a relationship where you've been continuously disrespected, have experienced gaslighting, and/or your boundaries have been ignored, consider this: you get to make this decision for you. You do not have to explain yourself. You do not have to prove to a partner that you need to be out of this relationship. 

What else? We are so curious! 

Something I say all the time is 'if you want to ghost, fine. But decide to ghost. Don't just do it because that's what you do. Don't do it on auto-pilot. Don't do it because you're avoiding the hard stuff. Make a choice."  Usually, if we're challenged to make a choice with autonomy versus an automatic response, we can choose more wisely and securely. 

There's a lot about boundaries and making choices from integrity (or from places of our real truth or true self). It's so important to have boundaries during a relationship, but also during a breakup. When you're breaking up with someone because you know you can't continue to grow in this relationship because your boundaries have been continuously violated, you aren't asking a question. Sometimes, you're not even having a conversation. We don't need permission to get out of a relationship that's not serving us. For those of us that have been talked out of a breakup in the moment, consider the following:

Do not have this conversation in a shared space or your home if there are complicated boundary issues. Do it somewhere public where you can leave (and don't drive together!). If a public place is not an option, do it at your (soon to be 'ex') partner's house. This isn't totally ideal, because often times partners end up hooking up. It's harder to hook up at the park or midday at the grocery store parking lot. 

Use the words "this isn't up for debate" or "it's not really a discussion.” You've made a decision. You get to stick to it.

Say your piece and get going. If you feel that it's appropriate to have more of a conversation, do it at a later time when both partners aren't in a heightened emotional state. 

A potentially controversial or unpopular thought: boundaries in relationships (and life) are so important. AND, some boundaries tell us where we have work to do and show us where we can continue to grow. I'm not talking about boundaries around safety. Some of us live really boundaried lives. Maybe we can't tolerate partners who raise their voices, drink too much, or *insert anything that churns up our trauma*. If these are your deal-breakers, that's fine—they get to be. But also, what healing do you need to do so that you get to be okay, even if your partner yells, decides to have one more drink, etc.  

Can you give us some insight about what folks can expect before/during/after a breakup with a partner through the lens of attachment theory?

There's no right or wrong way to feel through a breakup. There are, however, helpful and not-so-helpful ways to go about it. And a lot of that depends on your attachment style.

Many of the 'how to get over your breakup' lists, blogs, and books, are more helpful for folks with an anxious attachment style and less helpful (or seemingly less urgent) for people who have avoidant or secure styles. This is because people with the anxious style often experience the pain and grief of breakups more intensely. The common 'don't hook up with you ex, don't call them, block them from Instagram' advice is great (on both neurobiological and social levels), but this advice is mostly geared towards surviving a breakup through the lens of anxious attachment.

Folks with the anxious attachment style often have a super hard time letting go and moving on. This can slow down the healing process. Self-doubt, certainty that they’re inherently flawed, and/or that they’re destined to be alone can cause people with this style to hold on longer in relationships than is helpful. Because of this discomfort and anxiety, a lot of my clients with these patterns are rarely single, and/or often hook up with their exes. 

What to do: Give some space between you and your ex. Don't text them. Don't hook up with them. Maybe unfollow them from social media platforms. Allow yourself to heal and recognize when you're making decisions through an activated attachment lens. Then, after some self-soothing, decide from that place if you want to reach out/text/hook up, etc. 

It is often easier for securely attached folks to find healing and move forward. People who experience breakups through this lens still may feel incredible pain but are able to see the forest through the trees, so to speak. I often hear folks with a secure lens say "I love them so much, but I know it wasn't the right relationship for me," or are able to recognize there's likely someone else out there for them. Securely attached folks can more easily hold the duality of the pain of the heartbreak, and knowing they're okay. 

What to do: Basic self-care, including putting good foods into your body, exercising, surrounding yourself with friends or supportive family, and feeling your feelings (note: this is generally good guidance for anyone, at any time, regardless of attachment style!)

People with avoidant characteristics or tendencies may initiate a breakup if they feel intimacy is too much or if they perceive they are getting too close. Please note that this is a huge generalization that is meant to be helpful but not meant to be all-encompassing. Often my clients with this attachment type have been given feedback from their partner that they seem standoffish or have a hard time letting their partner into their relationship. It's important for avoidantly attached folks to remember that the end of relationship isn't inevitable and that we can learn to let our guard down and in turn, let our partners in. Sometimes folks with this pattern have already established distance throughout the relationship and may seem like they don't care or are already over it when the breakup happens. 

What to do: Remind yourself that you are deserving of connection and relationships. Be around folks who help you feel connected and alive. Do something vulnerable (spoiler alert: you'll survive it. It can serve as a great reminder that closeness/vulnerability isn't always awful). 

So what do we do about all this? It's so important to know our patterns. We can't adapt our patterns if we don't know they exist. It's important to stay curious about our relationships and understand the ways we process breakups. Our narratives (for example "something's wrong with me," or "intimacy=doom") dictate our understanding of our experiences, and it can be so helpful to recognize when that narrative is being influenced by some of our attachment tendencies/patterns.

Finally, remember that breakups can be traumatic and trauma throws us into our most familiar and old patterns, despite how unhelpful those patterns may be. Prepare for this. Survey your history and make note of how you handled your last breakup or the last time you felt deep sadness or were out of control. Was how you handled it helpful? If not, choose, decide—to step outside of that trauma response or maladaptive coping mechanism. Maybe you had a lot of casual sex that left you feeling good in the moment, but empty afterwards. Know that this is a thing you may do! Decide if that's the decision you want to make. Maybe you holed up in your room, totally isolated for 3 weeks and ran up a massive fee on food delivery services. Ask yourself—how was that for me? Does that help me? If the answer is a genuine 'yes,' I say go for it. But remember, some of the greatest coping skills can only take us so far. It's then we have to learn how to heal in a way that is helpful and healthy.

Where can folks find you to get some more support?

The fearful avoidant attachment style (known as disorganized in children) develops as a response to the bond a child forms with their primary caregiver(s) during the main formative period of childhood. Through how caregivers meet their needs, a child forms an internal working model of relationships, the world, and their place in it.

A distinctive contributory factor in the development of the fearful avoidant attachment style is perceived fear – in some cases, as the result of childhood trauma or abuse. This fear continues into adulthood as part of our mentalization of relationships, causing people with fearful avoidant attachment to deeply desire love, but also feel intensely frightened of it.

Although the fearful avoidant attachment style is considered to be the most distressing of the styles due to how it forms, it is entirely possible to achieve positive change and shift towards more secure attachment. This article can help you start this process through targeting the following topics:

The fearful-avoidant attachment style (also commonly known as disorganized attachment) is one of the three insecure attachment styles: anxious/preoccupied, avoidant/dismissive, and fearful avoidant.

The signs of the fearful-avoidant attachment style typically include the ones listed below. However, it’s important to be mindful that attachment styles are a spectrum (or dimensions) on which people can shift over the course of their lifetime according to experiences and circumstances. Therefore, if you have a fearful avoidant attachment style, you may notice that you embody some of these symptoms, but not all. This is normal.

Furthermore, even though the fearful avoidant attachment style has a very different developmental pathway, its traits often alternate between those of both the avoidant and anxious dimensions of attachment. Therefore, depending on your unique circumstances, you may highly experience the symptoms of one dimension, but not so much those of the other.

Attachment theory was developed by psychoanalyst and psychiatrist John Bowlby in the 1950s to account for the role of early caregiver-child bonds on socio-emotional development. In opposition to the psychoanalysis’ stance at the time that emotional problems can solely be attributed to internal processes, Bowlby postulated that such issues arise from how a child interacts with their environment in their early years.

The core concept of attachment theory is how parental sensitivity to a baby’s cues shapes the attachment style the child develops. By parental sensitivity, we mean the caregiver’s capacity to notice the differences between their child’s cries, interpret these cues accurately, and respond to them consistently and correctly. 

The more sensitive or attuned a caregiver is to their child, the more likely the child is to develop a secure attachment style. A secure attachment style means that a child is more likely to explore their environment with confidence, while also maintaining proximity with their caregiver as their presence indicates safety.

In contrast, a child who develops an insecure attachment style as a result of insensitive parenting tends to remain vigilant and stressed when exploring, even when their caregiver is nearby.

Attachment styles develop as a response to the bond we form with our primary caregiver(s) during the main formative period of childhood (typically the first eighteen months of life). Through how parents or caregivers meet their child’s needs, the child forms expectations about their world and the people in it.

Insecure attachment styles, in general, result from perceived unmet needs. As a result, a child doesn’t feel safe exploring their environment – regardless of whether or not their caregiver is present. However, as opposed to how the anxious and avoidant attachment styles develop from parental misattunement, the disorganized/fearful avoidant attachment style has quite specific origins.

The causes of the fearful-avoidant/disorganized attachment style are typically rooted in perceived fear. In some extreme cases, this fear is the result of childhood trauma or fear. Innately, an infant or child understands that their survival depends on their caregivers, so they seek safety in them. However, a problem arises when caregivers – instead of being a source of safety – become a source of fear.

If the caregivers show highly contrasting behavior, which is inconsistent and unpredictable, the child can start fearing for their safety. The child does not know what to expect. Nor do they know when the caregiver will meet their needs, if at all.

Another potential reason for such fear is if the child witnesses a traumatizing experience that involves the attachment figure. For instance, if the caregiver abuses the child (verbally, physically, or sexually) or if the child witnesses the caregiver abuse someone else.

As a result, children with a disorganized attachment style are not able to truly adapt to their caregivers’ behavior, as they are never able to predict what comes next. The child understands that they cannot rely on their caregiver to meet their physical or emotional needs. 

In terms of behaviors, children with a disorganized attachment style often lack coherence: They might seek closeness with their caregivers as they desire affection and love, but at the same time, they may reject their caregivers’ proximity and distance themselves, due to fear.

The fearful avoidant attachment style is considered to be the most psychologically distressing of the insecure styles – but with the right knowledge it is entirely possible to cope. The following are some ways to cope with fearful avoidant attachment.

Understanding how your attachment style developed and still influences your adult emotions and actions is one of the most effective ways of coping. Developing self-awareness includes understanding your triggers and how your attachment system is primed to respond to these. Once you recognize these triggers and reactions, you can start implementing self-soothing strategies such as self-care, mindfulness, and cognitive exercises to start responding in more regulated ways. 

Understanding where your emotions come from and communicating them openly is a healthier way of managing them than bottling them up or allowing them to explode (internally or externally). Communicating openly can also strengthen relational bonds as you’re demonstrating trust and emotional availability to another person.

Plus, actively listening to a loved one can help you better understand their intentions and facilitate the relational bond. Active listening includes not only listening to the words the other person is saying, but also what they’re not saying by paying attention to body language, facial expressions and so on.

The fearful avoidant attachment style originates from a childhood in which fear is present, so essential needs remain unmet. As adults, people with this attachment style need to identify these needs and how to meet them in healthy ways. According to Jeff Young’s schema therapy, we have five core emotional needs. These are:

Consider each of these needs and how you feel they’re currently being met. What actions can you take to have these needs met? Can you communicate non-confrontationally to someone close to you (such as a partner) how they could help you get these needs met? Do you need to take weekly “Me-Time”? Can you increase the amount of social support you’re receiving?

Some people with fearful avoidant attachment may benefit from self-directed approaches such as workbooks or courses, but those with deeply ingrained trauma may respond better to therapy. Therapy is an excellent environment for rewriting mental representations of relationships, building trust, increasing knowledge of attitudes and actions, learning how to regulate emotions healthily – and transferring these skills to other relationships. 

If your relationships often take you on an emotional rollercoaster, this book might just be the step you need to take to begin your journey to positive change!

We understand that the fearful avoidant attachment style can cause a lot of distress and resentment from childhood. For this reason, if you have any remaining questions on the disorganized or fearful avoidant attachment style, the following answers to frequently asked questions may help.

The fearful avoidant attachment style (or disorganized attachment in childhood) typically results from formative years in which core needs are left unmet by a primary caregiver. Although all of the insecure attachment styles result from the perception of unmet needs, how the disorganized attachment style forms is unique as it results from a perception of fear. This fear may result from chaotic or unpredictable caregiver behaviors, trauma, or abuse. A childhood in which a caregiver is both a source of fear and safety creates a mentalization of relationships moving forward in life. Therefore, causing someone with this attachment style to both intensely desire and fear relationships. 

It’s also important to note that while most cases of fearful avoidant attachment are the result of childhood experiences, some people may encounter traumatic experiences after childhood which may result in this attachment style. An example of such may include abusive relationships.

You may be fearful avoidant because you both deeply desire and intensely fear relationships. This conflicting attitude may be the result of a childhood in which primary caregiver(s) were a source of both safety and fear, perhaps as the result of trauma or abuse (emotional or physical). Such conditions can cause a child to form an internal working model for relationships moving forward, and, thus, view romantic connections in adulthood as both desirable and frightening. 

The fearful-avoidant attachment style is not that common, reportedly occurring in only 7% of the population. However, findings from The Attachment Project’s data demonstrate that over 25% of our sample have fearful avoidant attachment, and that it’s particularly present in the 18-24 age range. It is worth noting that people likely come to our website due to relational difficulties, so this may be a high representation.

The fearful avoidant attachment style is considered to be the style that causes the most distress due to how it develops. However, it is possible to shift from fearful avoidant to secure attachment patterns. Therapy is considered to be the best route for starting the process of change, as a therapist can help facilitate trust and demonstrate healthy methods of emotion regulation within the therapeutic dynamic. Alternatively, self-directed routes such as workbooks, relationships with people with a secure attachment style, and strategies such as those listed within this article can also help. 

You may notice that the terms “disorganized” and “fearful avoidant” are used interchangeably for this attachment style. Generally speaking, disorganized is the term used for childhood, and fearful avoidant for adulthood. This is due to how, during the initial classification stages of attachment styles, Mary Main noticed that there was a subgroup of children with “disorganized” patterns of behaviors which didn’t fit within the other classifications. However, fearful avoidant is more appropriate for adult patterns of behaviors, in which individuals with this style display incoherency around pushing for intimacy yet retreating from it out of fear.

# Fearful-Avoidant Attachment: 13 Signs & Relationship Patterns | mindbodygreen

Login

According to attachment theory, our approach to forming relationships with other people is a direct reflection of our earliest experiences with our caregivers, as well as other influential relationships in our life. There are three main adult attachment styles: secure, anxious, and avoidant. But there's also a fourth attachment style that's much more rare and thus hardly talked about: fearful-avoidant attachment.

Fearful-avoidant attachment is a pattern of behavior in relationships that is marked by both high anxiety and high avoidance, wherein a person both craves connection but also fears getting too close to anyone. Also known as disorganized attachment, it's the rarest of the four attachment styles.

The fearful-avoidant attachment style is considered to be a combination of the anxious attachment style and the avoidant attachment style. People with an anxious attachment style are constantly seeking more intimacy and reassurances in their relationships, often coming off as "needy" partners, whereas people with an avoidant attachment style tend to do the opposite and push others away out of a fear of intimacy.

But the fearful-avoidant attachment style involves a combination of both feeling anxious for affection and avoiding it at all costs. A 2019 study1 published in the Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy describes it as "reluctant to engage in a close relationship and a dire need to be loved by others."

According to psychologists Nicolas Favez and Herve Tissot, the researchers behind the study, this attachment style is seldom talked about and not well-researched because it's much rarer than the other three attachment styles. But some research has found fearful-avoidant people to have "the most psychological and relational risks."

A few that Favez and Tissot mention in their study:

"Fearful avoidance or disorganization has also been shown to be linked2 with borderline personality disorders or dissociative symptoms," they write.

You can take this five-minute attachment style quiz to determine your attachment style. In general though, it might hard to tell if you have the fearful-avoidant attachment style without consulting with a professional, in part because it tends to present a combination of behaviors that also align with both the anxious and avoidant attachment styles.

Attachment styles are thought to form in early childhood based on a person's relationship with their earliest caregivers. People who grew up with trustworthy caregivers who engaged in consistent ways with them (including a lot of love and attention) generally end up with a secure attachment style, meaning they have generally healthy relationships where they feel secure, loved, and able to love back. 

Those whose parental relationships were unreliable, nonexistent, or troubled tend to end up with one of the three insecure attachment style, whether anxious, avoidant, or fearful-avoidant.

Some studies suggest trauma might be a key factor in the development of fearful-avoidant attachment, Favez and Tissot write. As children, those with fearful avoidance react to stress with "apparently incoherent behaviors," they explain, such as aimlessness, fear of their caregiver, or aggressiveness toward their caregiver. Earlier studies have hypothesized this behavior comes from abuse or other traumatic experiences with their caregiver. In response, the child becomes "constantly caught between deactivation (as the attachment figure cannot be a source of reassurance) and hyperactivation (the presence of the 'frightening' figure constantly triggers attachment needs)."

In other words, a child who is afraid of their caregiver finds themselves desperately needing comfort but has learned that they cannot trust the person who gives it to them. In adulthood, this manifests as both wanting intimacy in your relationships but instinctively fearing it and trying to escape it.

People with a fearful-avoidant attachment style tend to have either very troubled relationships or very tenuous, distant ones that lack real intimacy or commitment. That's usually because of the way fearful-avoidant people may behave in relationships.

"It is displayed in adults through poor coping skills, a lack of coping strategies, erratic behavior, and difficulty dealing with issues in relationships and in real-life problems," therapist Chamin Ajjan, M.S., LCSW, A-CBT, previously told mbg of this disorganized attachment style. "[They] can be unpredictable and volatile in relationships." These behaviors can make for chaotic, intense, or even abusive relationships.

Alternatively, some fearful-avoidant people may generally not enter into committed relationships at all. People with this attachment style tend to both seek out connection and closeness while simultaneously trying to avoid actually entering into a serious relationship, so instead they may be more likely to find themselves in a prolonged courtship that never actually turns into a relationship, "situationships," casual sexual relationships, or relationships without labels.

While all of these types of relationships can be approached in healthy ways, often fearful-avoidants end up in these dynamics not because they want them that way but because they're afraid of getting closer and leaning in fully. They may be unable to fully trust that someone will actually commit and be there for them, whether because of a core lack of self-worth, a core lack of trust in others, or some combination of the two.

Some people with the fearful-avoidant attachment style may also fear how a relationship will impact them or their lives, worried about "losing themself" in some way or getting hurt. But at the same time, they find themselves seeking out the closeness and connection of partnership to get their emotional needs met. This can lead to an endless cycle of approach and avoid with potential partners, which can often look like a serious of confusing, incoherent behaviors and mixed signals.

Favez and Tissot's study, which surveyed 600 men and women about their relationships and sex lives, found people with a fearful-avoidant attachment style tend to have a lot more sexual partners than other people. They also tended to be a lot more sexually compliant, which means when someone asks to have sex with you, you're more likely to say yes whether or not you really want it. Put otherwise, while plenty of people have lot of sex with many different partners for the physical pleasure, the excitement, or any number of other reasons, fearful-avoidants might find themselves having a lot of sex with a lot of different people even if they're not that interested in the sex itself.

Why? The researchers theorized these behaviors develop in response to the confusion of both wanting connection but also feeling repulsed by it. "The elevated anxiety felt in fearful avoidance may motivate the individual to increase closeness with a partner by using sexual activities, whereas the elevated avoidance tendency may almost simultaneously motivate the individual to break the bond with this partner...which is in turn followed by the search for a new partner."

Plenty of research3 has also found some people who experience sexual trauma respond by becoming "hypersexual" (i.e., having tons of sex with a lot of different people, sometimes in risky ways), and trauma has also been linked to the development of fearful-avoidant attachment.

Of course, a lifestyle involving having a lot of sex with a lot of different partners can be perfectly healthy for some people with the right set of physical and emotional precautions. But doing it out of a simultaneous craving for and fear of connection can quickly become draining and perhaps even destructive, especially if you start finding yourself saying yes to sex you don't want or sex that puts your well-being at risk. Likewise, if you're breaking connections with people when you really desire to get closer to them, you're putting your mind and heart through a lot of heartache due to your own fears.

If you're relating to any of the above and feeling nervous, take a deep breath. The good news is that attachment styles are malleable and can be adjusted through conscious intention and practice. You can change your attachment style. Here's how to get things back on track if you have fearful-avoidant attachment:

If your fearful avoidance really is tied to experiencing trauma in childhood, therapy must play an important role in healing from this attachment wound. Favez and Tissot recommend pursuing a type of therapy that focuses on attachment, such as emotionally focused couple therapy.

It's essential that you start understanding why you make the decisions you make regarding your relationships, and mindfulness—the practice of being present and aware of one's emotions—can be a good way to work on building up your self-awareness.

"In relationships, shifting from reactiveness to responsiveness can lift us out of our early attachment patterns toward a healthier, more secure style," licensed marriage and family therapist Linda Carroll, M.S., writes at mbg. "Next time you feel a partner coming too close or moving too far away, listen to what each of you is saying and how it's said. You might notice that your words in emotional situations trigger a physiological reaction of fight or flight. Simply becoming aware of each other's old fears is the first step in preventing them from controlling us."

If your goal is to ultimately form a close emotional bond with someone, you'll need to tell that person exactly what you want and why you struggle with it. This way, you can both work on solutions to help overcome your hurdles and get closer.

"With any prospective partner you meet, you should be honest about your own attachment type and what it means," Peter Lovenheim, author of The Attachment Effect: Exploring the Powerful Ways Our Earliest Bond Shapes Our Relationships and Lives, writes at mbg. "There's no point in pretending to be more eager than you are for intimacy, cuddles, and soul-mating. You want, after all, to find someone who accepts your attachment type and will be comfortable with you just as you are."

This isn't just a feel-good catchphrase for you. At core, people with fearful-avoidant personalities are suffering from relationship insecurity—an instilled belief that people in your life are going to reject or leave you, just like your earliest caregivers or loved ones did. You need to actively work to break that toxic mindset that views yourself as unworthy because of what happened in your past.

"Here's the truth: There's no person out there who can heal your attachment issues," couples counselor Margaret Paul, Ph.D., tells mbg. "True healing occurs when you learn to be the loving parent that you never had to yourself. In what ways did your childhood hurt you? How can you give yourself the security, support, and validation you never had?"

# Fearful Avoidant Attachment: What This Means in Relationships

Humans learn to attach, or connect, to one another through their relationships with their parents. 

Babies who have their needs met are more likely to develop secure, emotionally strong personalities. Babies who don’t have their needs met may develop anxious, avoidant, and even fearful personalities.

The type of personality you develop can determine a great deal about your life. In particular, it plays a significant role in how you find and maintain relationships.

People who develop a fearful avoidant attachment style often desire closeness. They seek intimacy from partners. However, they may be unable to achieve the deep connection they long for. 

That’s because their attachment experiences have taught them to be fearful of intimacy. In some cases, their personality leads them to even reject close bonds. This can spur a cycle of rocky relationships and extreme emotional highs and lows.

Understanding fearful avoidant attachment can help you understand why you react the way you do in relationships. If you believe a loved one has this style of attachment, understanding where the instincts come from may also help you respond to them, too. 

Ultimately, however, there are ways to relearn attachment so you or your loved one can have healthier relationships. 

Several types of attachment styles are born out of the first years of a person’s life. These broad attachment styles include:

Infants who have their needs met develop secure attachments. They’re more likely to feel confident and trusting. 

People who didn’t have their earliest needs met, or those who faced adversity during that time, may be less secure in themselves. They may also find forming intimate relationships difficult.

Individuals with an insecure attachment style can develop characteristics that further define why they have such a hard time forming bonds with others. 

People with anxious preoccupied attachment, for example, greatly desire to feel wanted. They spend a lot of time thinking about relationships and idolize their future partners. 

In turn, they require frequent reassurance and validation. That can be taxing on a partner and difficult to maintain.

People with this style of attachment have a hard time being open with others. They often reject emotional overtures from loved ones or potential partners. 

This self-isolation can ultimately lead to people feeling relationships aren’t worth the trouble.

This last attachment style occurs in people who responded to a lack of bonding by becoming fearful of future bonds. They do, however, often still want relationships. 

In fact, they may actively seek them out. But when the relationship becomes too serious or the partner wants greater intimacy, the person with fearful avoidant attachment may respond by withdrawing from the relationship entirely.

Children learn attachment behaviors from an early age. In infancy, babies learn to attach to another person based on the behavior or reaction they get from their parents, caregivers, or other humans.

If the attachment is strong, the child may feel secure. This can lead to future healthy bonds. 

If the attachment is challenged, the child may struggle with future relationships and attachments. They may face insecurity in the face of emotional situations.

As children grow older and enter adulthood, these emotional attachment styles can have profound effects. A person’s attachment style will play into their romantic relationships as well as professional ones and friendships.

People with fearful avoidant attachment may show signs like:

People with fearful avoidant attachment are prone to have rocky, dramatic relationships. These scenarios may help you understand how people with this style of attachment behave and why.

While people with fearful avoidant attachment actively want to have a relationship, their instincts work against their wishes. They resist the intimacy that’s necessary for a relationship, so casual sex may feel safer.

People with this type of attachment style fear being abandoned. They also fear feeling trapped in a relationship. That makes them oscillate between emotional highs and lows. It may prevent a meaningful relationship in the long term. They may seem unstable or reactionary to others.

In the normal course of a relationship, partners get to know one another’s likes, dislikes, fears, anxieties, and more. 

When a person with fearful avoidant attachment begins to feel pushed to share their emotions and intimate thoughts, they may shut off communication entirely. This is designed to protect them and their fear of being too exposed.

It’s possible to change your attachment style. Though most people develop their style from infancy, therapists and other mental health professionals can work with you to understand your style, why you react the way you do, and learn to adapt new techniques.

Talk therapy is foundational in helping people learn to cope with and eventually change from a fearful avoidant attachment style. Therapists can identify reasons the person may have adapted this style. They can then work with you to relearn attachment.

At the same time, family counseling or relationship counseling can help your loved ones learn to help you work through these changes. 

A great deal of attachment style is reinforced by others’ behaviors. If you can work together, you may be able to relearn attachment more easily.

If you have fearful avoidant attachment, or if you’re in a relationship with a person who has this attachment style, these tips will help you learn to cope as you begin to better understand and reshape your relationships.

People with fearful avoidant attachment deeply desire intimacy. They’re also immensely terrified by it. You can encourage them to talk about what they’re feeling or what fears they sense, but don’t be aggressive. This could push them to shut down.

If your partner or loved one has this attachment style, they ultimately fear you’ll leave them or that they’ll want to leave. Be comforting and supportive. Seeing you’re sticking with them through this time of understanding and change can go a long way to building confidence.

People with insecure attachments often have low self-esteem. This can be troubling in many relationships. Give yourself space to realize some relationships are worth your effort and some aren’t. 

Little by little, you can find healthier ways to communicate. An intimate, long-term relationship is possible.

By instinct, people with this type of attachment style often set boundaries, mostly invisible ones. They don’t always know where they are or why they happen, but these boundaries help them feel safe in emotional situations. 

It can be helpful to others in your life for you to try to vocalize those boundaries. Tell them what makes you feel fear and what triggers your anxiety. This can help you avoid them together.

You and your family member, friend, or partner are quite different. You react in different ways to one another. It takes a great deal of self-awareness to recognize your tendencies and actively work to correct them. 

If you tend to shut down when emotional conversations begin, a partner can actively push you to be open. If your partner becomes emotionally charged, you can employ ways to promote calmness. 

You can hold one another accountable, and you can become better communicators. A therapist may be able to help you begin this process.

People with this type of attachment style often don’t know how they should respond in emotional situations. 

A therapist can help facilitate uncomfortable conversations with yourself and with loved ones about how you or they feel. A therapist can then help you relearn how to react to one another in a healthful way.

Here’s how to access therapy for every budget.

Attachment is the fundamental way humans learn to interact and communicate with one another. 

Some people have healthy, strong attachment styles. Others may have attachment styles that are less secure. This can lead to self-destructive behaviors, like avoiding relationships and fearing intimacy.

The good news is you can change your attachment style. It may take time, work, and a great deal of understanding from people in your life. But it’s possible for you to build intimate, secure relationships that fulfill you and help you feel safe.

# Fearful Avoidant Attachment: Definition, Causes, and Signs

A fearful avoidant attachment style may cause you to long for intimacy while simultaneously rejecting it. 

According to attachment theory, children form attachments to at least one primary caregiver during their early years. 

This attachment relationship can lead to an overall attachment style, which stays with the child as they move through life. Attachment styles can significantly affect adult relationships. 

Fearful avoidant attachment, also called disorganized attachment, is an insecure attachment. People with a fearful avoidant attachment style tend to have difficulty trusting others, but at the same time, crave closeness and security. 

But with the right support, many people with a fearful avoidant attachment style are able to cope and develop healthy and loving relationships.

The signs of fearful avoidant attachment can vary from person to person, so children and adults with this attachment style may only show a few of the signs listed below. 

Some may display more characteristics related to avoidant attachment while others show more signs of fearful attachment.

 Keep in mind that many of these signs can be symptoms of underlying mental health conditions, including depression and social anxiety, and don’t necessarily indicate fearful avoidant attachment. 

While they are developed during the early childhood years, attachment styles can also continue to affect relationships well into adulthood.

Adults with a fearful-avoidant attachment style may be more vulnerable to mental health conditions like depression and social anxiety. They may also have a higher number of sexual partners, according to a 2017 study.

According to attachment theory, different attachment styles are formed as a result of the relationship that you have with a primary caregiver as an infant. An infant who has a positive, nurturing, and safe relationship with their caregiver will likely form a secure attachment style.

Fearful-avoidant attachment tends to stem from unpredictable behaviors from the parent or caregiver. If you have a fearful avoidant attachment style, your primary caregiver may have given you affection only to suddenly withdraw it. 

Your parent may have been inconsistent and, for whatever reason, failed to provide you with appropriate nurturing when you felt fearful or insecure.

If you developed a fearful avoidant attachment style during childhood, then it may still be affecting your relationships and daily life today. This may be especially true if neither you nor your parent received intervention to correct the attachment when you were younger.

But there are still ways to cope with and heal from a fearful-avoidant attachment style and learn how to maintain healthy and loving relationships.

Many people with a fearful-avoidant attachment style may also need professional support to learn how to strengthen their relationships and cope with painful feelings. 

This is especially important if you live with mental health conditions like social anxiety or if you’re a survivor of childhood abuse.

A therapist can help you: 

With their support, you can heal from childhood trauma or challenges and build positive and healthy relationships that meet your emotional needs.

How a person sees themselves and how they engage in their closest relationships can be a product of their unique attachment style. A person’s attachment style may be shaped in part in their formative years in response to several factors, including their primary caregiver’s attachment style, their environment, and whether their caregivers tended to their basic needs for safety and connection.

There are four types of attachment: secure, anxious, avoidant, and fearful-avoidant, or “disorganized” attachment. A person’s attachment style is formed in their infancy and, while it can change throughout life, may guide some of their beliefs, thoughts, and behaviors in adulthood. 

Children who are raised to develop a fearful-avoidant attachment style often come from unpredictable environments filled with abuse, neglect, or abandonment. In these situations, a child can become conditioned to “chase” after their caregiver for the love and safety they seek while also “running” from and fearing this person as someone who is inconsistent and often abusive. Children who develop a “disorganized” attachment style may continue to struggle in forming more secure bonds in their adult lives, where they may oscillate between experiences of high anxiety and high avoidance behaviors in their relationships.

A fearful-avoidant attachment style is thought to be associated with symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD), including deep fears of abandonment, a longing for intimacy, and also a deep fear of rejection or not being seen as “good enough.”1

Both those with a fearful-avoidant attachment style and those with a diagnosis of BPD may have histories of childhood abuse and neglect. Some may have also experienced caregivers who were unreliable, unpredictable, or emotionally unstable, including family members who may have struggled with their own mental health. As a result, a very young child often learns they cannot trust their caregiver to protect them or support their basic needs for safety and belonging, which can create “gaps” in their emotional development and may leave them vulnerable to feeling less securely attached to others in their adult lives.

Some may notice that their learned beliefs, feelings about themselves, and patterns of engaging in relationships are carried over from their childhood into their adult lives. Adults with a fearful-avoidant attachment style often display a “push-pull” dynamic in their romantic relationships that may include intense emotions, a need for control, and patterns of behavioral instability.3 These patterns typically surface when a person’s attachment system has been activated (“triggered”) and fears of abandonment or engulfment take center stage.

A person with a fearful-avoidant attachment style is often at an increased risk for behavioral addictions and/or compulsive behaviors surrounding sex.2 Some theories suggest that persons with a fearful-avoidant attachment style may use sex or have higher rates of sexual partners as a way of trying to get their core needs met for connection and belonging that typically went unmet in childhood. Yet many with a fearful-avoidant attachment style also report histories of abusive and narcissistic romantic relationships including incidences of anger and violence which may suggest they may overstay in a toxic relationship to prevent or minimize fears of rejection.3

Other patterns seen in a fearful-avoidant attachment style can include:

If you recognize yourself as struggling with developing or maintaining more securely attached relationships in your life, it is important to note that there is support and help available. It’s also important to recognize that these patterns are typically learned behaviors and maladaptive thoughts that often originate in childhood from invalidating or unsafe environments that may replay in your romantic relationships.

While it is suggested to unpack these core wounds with a therapist trained in early trauma, there are some skills you can foster on your own.

First, it’s important to pause and reflect on whether you are reacting in your relationships based on “survival mode” and to recognize any unhealthy core beliefs that may have been taught in your childhood. If you notice that you may be falling into a learned pattern of believing your relationships will end in abandonment or rejection, consider whether you are examining truths associated with your relationship, or if your relationship is being examined from a place of insecurity and fear.

It’s also important to allow yourself time alone, and for your partner to have time to themselves. All relationships require a mix of autonomy and interdependence. Yet, this can be frightening for someone living with a more insecure attachment style because time to yourself can trigger fears of abandonment and rejection.

Additionally, this time could also be used to examine any faulty beliefs or maladaptive thoughts that surface and trigger feeling unsafe in your relationships (i..e that they are going to leave you, that they don’t love you, etc.).

Lastly, it is also important to slowly and consistently explore building trust with those closest to you in your life, including your partner, family, or friends. This may include asking them for extra support when you are feeling vulnerable, setting and maintaining your boundaries, and respecting theirs.

The 5 conditions for secure attachment

Disorganized attachment is one of the three insecure attachment styles. Unfortunately, it is often seen as the most difficult to manage of the attachment styles as it typically develops in a childhood of fear, inconsistency, and even abuse.

A disorganized / fearful-avoidant attachment style can develop when a child’s caregivers–their only source of safety–become a source of fear.

As adults, people with the disorganized attachment style can be extremely inconsistent in their behaviors and experience difficulties with their self-beliefs and with trusting others. Such issues can potentially lead to mental health issues such as mood disorders.

However, there is hope–with the proper treatment and information, it is always possible to heal from an insecure attachment, even if you have a disorganized attachment style.

In this guide, we will cover the most common questions around disorganized attachment:

As soon as a baby is born, the bonding process with their caregivers (usually parents) begins. For the first few years, the child is entirely dependent on their caregivers as they are responsible for the child’s primary physiological needs (food, shelter, safety, and so on), as well as their emotional ones (love, care, support, and so on).

If caregivers are sensitive towards, attuned to, and consistently respond to these needs, a child starts to build the foundations of a secure attachment, as their caregiver’s presence equals safety.

As a result, the child learns indirectly that they can rely on, and thus, trust other people. A secure and stable attachment is formed.

However, in some cases, a child perceives that their needs are not met and that their caregivers are not emotionally available or responsive when they seek their attention, affection, or support. As a result, the child is unable to form a secure bond and, instead, may develop an insecure attachment.

We’ve discussed the basics of how attachment styles form, but what are the three types of insecure attachment?

Insecure attachment styles typically develop as a response to misattuned parenting and as a form of adaptation.

For example, if a child perceives the parents as unpredictable or neglecting, the child might become overly clingy and needy. In other words, the child lacks attention and starts working harder to get it.

Later on in life, this child (now a teenager or adult) continues to question whether they are good enough, lovable, or worthy.

Such individuals can develop a low self-esteem and need constant reassurance from their partners. This is known as an anxious attachment style, which is characterized by a strong fear of abandonment and rejection.

If the child perceives that their emotional needs are rejected by the parents, the child stops expecting any response from their parents. Thus, the child learns that they should not express emotions openly or seek support, because they are not going to receive such.

As time goes by, such children (now grown-up) become self-sufficient and independent. Other people will reject their emotions anyway, so why bother trying to express them? This is the ‘strategy’ behind the avoidant attachment style.

We see that there is a sort of continuity and coherence in each of the two attachment styles described above.

What makes the disorganized / fearful-avoidant attachment style different is that it implies a lack of coherence in the individual’s social behavior.

Most attachment specialists believe that the disorganized attachment style is the most difficult of the three insecure attachment styles to treat because it incorporates both the anxious and the avoidant styles.

The disorganized attachment style is believed to be a consequence of childhood trauma or abuse. Perceived fear is the central aspect of its development.

The survival of the infant/child depends on the caregivers. The child knows that subconsciously, so he or she seeks safety in the caregivers. A problem arises when the source of safety becomes a source of fear.

If the caregivers show highly contrasting behavior, which is inconsistent and unpredictable, the child can start fearing his or her own safety.

The child does not know what to expect. Nor does the child know when the caregiver will meet their needs, if at all.

Another reason for fear is having or witnessing a traumatizing experience that involves the attachment figure.

For instance, the caregiver abuses the child (verbally, physically, or sexually) or the child witnesses the caregiver abuse someone else.

Either way, the child no longer trusts the caregiver. The child realizes that they cannot rely on caregivers to meet their physical or emotional needs. The caregivers, who should be acting as a source of safety, are not only unreliable, but they are also causing fear.

Children with a disorganized attachment style are not able to truly adapt to the caregivers’ behavior, as they never know what comes next.

Such children lack coherence in their own behavior towards the caregivers: they might seek closeness, but at the same time, reject the caregivers’ proximity and distance themselves, due to fear.

Adults with a fearful-avoidant or a  disorganized attachment style in relationships lack of a coherent approach. On the one hand, they want to belong. They want to love and be loved.

While on the other hand, they are afraid to let anyone in. They have a strong fear that the people who are closest to them will hurt them.

Adults with a disorganized attachment style fear intimacy and avoid proximity, similar to individuals with an avoidant attachment style. The main difference for disorganized adults is that they want relationships.

They do not reject emotional intimacy; they are simply afraid of it. Adults with a disorganized attachment style continue to view the attachment figure (once, their caregiver, and now, their partner) as unpredictable.

They have trouble believing that their partner will love and support them as they are. These adults expect and are waiting for the rejection, disappointment, and hurt to come. In their perception, it is inevitable.

This mindset can turn into a form of self-sabotage, causing the disorganized adult to end a relationship prematurely.

It might also be a type of self-fulfilling prophecy. So, the disorganized adult expects and predicts that they will be rejected by their partner. Even when there are no such signs, he or she starts behaving in a way that leads to fulfilling the expectations (the end of the relationship).

It is also a self-fulfilling prophecy when an individual with a disorganized attachment style chooses partners that induce fear. Thus confirming their perception that they can’t trust other people (emotionally or physically), no matter what.

They are at a higher risk of developing mental health issues, such as substance abuse, delinquent/aggressive behavior, and abuse on their own children.

Research also demonstrates a link between the disorganized attachment style in adults and borderline personality disorder.

Living with a disorganized attachment style is certainly not easy. Imagine playing a game that you never really understood the rules of.

You want to play with others, but no one ever taught you how. When it’s your turn, you make your move, but you never know what to expect afterwards. You keep losing without knowing why.

Fortunately, there are ways to heal. And it is important to do so for yourself, for your loved ones, and eventually, for your children.

A disorganized attachment style can cause a lot of distress and confusion when it comes to social interactions and intimacy. It can harm your relationships and lead you to lose someone you really want in your life.

Being around or with someone with this attachment style is also challenging. The unpredictability, suspicion, and lack of trust from that individual can be hurtful and frightening.

A caregiver with a disorganized attachment style raising a child is one of the key predictors of a child’s emotional development.

So, if you, as a parent, have an unresolved trauma or loss, you are likely to raise a child with a disorganized attachment style.

If you want to delve deeper into the topic, read our latest article on trauma bonding.

One of the key issues in people with this attachment style is fear of someone they trust hurting them. The easiest solution? Do not trust anyone. This, however, is not a very productive or fruitful solution.

Simply avoiding proximity will not heal the trauma or the painful childhood experiences. In order to learn to build secure relationships, you need to learn to trust people first.

This sounds easy, but for adults with a disorganized attachment style, it can be quite challenging. For this reason, it might be best to start off easy and not push yourself.

One way to start healing is by working with a psychotherapist. A therapist is someone you can trust, as he or she will offer a non-judging, accepting, calm, and predictable space for you to open up.

You might be able to express and make sense of your experiences, emotions, and needs in a safe environment.

Another option you could consider is trying to heal on your own. That could be a promising approach, as it does not push your limits that much. It does not require trusting a stranger right away.

We recently released our first series of attachment style digital workbooks to help guide you.

If your relationships often take you on an emotional rollercoaster, this book might just be the step you need to take to begin your journey to positive change.

The disorganized attachment digital workbook includes:

There’s no easy “fix” for the disorganized attachment style, but it is possible to heal from the disorganised attachment style and develop more secure outlooks, attitudes, and relationships. As we mentioned in this article, the best way to heal a disorganized attachment style is through the therapeutic relationship. Furthermore, understanding how your attachment style formed and is maintained by reactions to triggers helps in this process.

Dealing with disorganized attachment can be a challenge as it is considered to be the most unpredictable of the insecure attachment styles. However, it is possible to learn how to deal with this attachment style in healthy ways. To improve your quality of life and relationships, you could try therapy, workbooks, and self-soothing strategies.

The disorganized attachment style is rooted in a childhood of perceived fear; caregivers, who should be a source of safety, are instead a source of alarm. However, to fully understand how the disorganized attachment style forms in childhood, consult the section in this article on how the disorganized attachment style develops.

            The fearful avoidant attachment is thought to be the most difficult. Sadly, this attachment style is often seen in children that have experienced trauma or abuse.

            Self-regulation means that you manage your emotions and actions in regard to what you want in the long-run. Basically, it means think before you act. This means understanding what triggers you in your relationships.

Healthy relationships require the right mix of intimacy and independence. Those with insecure attachment struggle to get this balance right. They either worry excessively about their relationships or hold themselves back from fully committing to their partners.

Shaped largely by early childhood experiences, insecure attachment can persist throughout the lifespan, affecting the quality and outcome of adult relationships. Thankfully, those with insecure attachment can learn to trust and commit to their relationships by adopting new beliefs and behaviors.

Below are some suggestions for how to do this.

Learn about the four main attachment styles as well as the associated thoughts and behaviors. This empowers you to spot trends in your relationship history and make a plan to break unhelpful patterns.

Views about relationships tend to get set early in life. If your caregivers were unsafe or neglectful, you’ll likely be distrustful of your adult relationships. For that reason, it’s important to investigate what is actually true about your current relationships and abandon outdated beliefs and interpretations.

Next time you hesitate to trust or commit to your partner, try to find evidence that justifies your concern. Consider that you may be projecting experiences from past relationships onto your current relationship.

Those with insecure attachment tend to cling to their relationships (anxious style) or hold themselves aloof from them (avoidant style). If you have an anxious style, try taking small steps toward becoming more independent. If you have an avoidant style, try letting down your guard and initiating intimacy.

The goal is to find the sweet spot where you have healthy levels of both intimacy and independence. It’s hard work to break a pattern, but remind yourself of the many rewards of improving your relationships.

If you’re unable to manage and work with your emotions, you’ll likely be more reactive in your relationships, which decreases attachment security. Learning to express and tolerate your emotions makes you better able to empathize with those of your partner.

Working toward a secure attachment requires communicating your hopes, fears, and concerns in a respectful, open-hearted way. Non-verbal communication is equally important. Eye contact, nodding, and physical contact can help defuse tension when used skillfully. When conflict does happens, listen empathetically to your partner and determine how you can help each other feel understood and connected, even if you disagree.

If you want to run a marathon, it’s helpful to surround yourself with successful runners. In the same way, you can improve your relationships by learning about how people with healthy relationships think and behave. Notice or ask how these individuals set appropriate boundaries in their partnerships.

If you don’t have a partner, remember that seeking someone who is securely attached can make it easier in your own journey toward secure attachment. If you’re in a relationship, reflect on areas where improvement is needed.

Stress can worsen attachment issues, even among those with secure attachment. This is particularly true of relationship-related turmoil, such as frequent arguments or the prospect of separation or divorce. Be proactive by committing to self-care, addressing conflict before it escalates, and engaging in calming activities with your partner.

To summarize, these are the steps you can take to work toward secure attachment and improve your relationship satisfaction: 

These actions work with thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, giving you an integrated approach to breaking old patterns and becoming more securely attached.

As you work toward secure attachment, keep this principle in mind: Relationship harmony revolves around skillfully expressing your attachment needs and discerning those of your partner. Set aside regular time to reflect on how you and your partner can help each other feel respected, understood, and loved. With consistent effort, this practice can lead to greater intimacy and a more fulfilling relationship.

# How to Develop a Secure Attachment Style

People with a secure attachment style feel comfortable developing trust in relationships and aren’t afraid to become close to other people, which sounds pretty nice! So how do you develop a secure attachment style? We’ve collected the information to get you started.

A secure attachment style looks like being at ease in intimate, close relationships (both romantically and platonically!). People who have secure attachment feel right at home when they’re dating, making new friends, or working alongside coworkers. They trust that others will do their part in maintaining a healthy and appropriate connection and don’t feel stressed or anxiety when alone.

Any of the following behaviors also suggest a secure attachment style:

There are many more ways that someone can display a general secure attachment, too. But this is not to say that people who have secure attachment do not have issues with their mental health at times! They simply feel good about connecting with others and do generally so in healthy ways.

Your attachment style develops as a result of the care you received as a baby and as a child. Attachment theory posits that your first relationships are incredibly impactful — that how your caregivers raised you will influence your attachment style.

When you’re a baby, your brain hasn’t yet learned how people connect with one another, including what they say, how they treat each other, and what closeness looks like. As with everything else, babies and young children learn by example, so when their caregivers act a certain way, they learn to act that way as well. Most importantly, babies take in and record how they feel when they’re around people. This plays out across childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.

Growing up in a stable, trusting environment is a privilege. While some adults were not given the opportunity to develop a secure attachment style as babies and children, that’s not to say that it will never happen for them. There are many ways to develop a more secure attachment style, even when you’re past the critical age for development.

Here are a few ways to move to a secure attachment style as an adult:

While you develop a more secure attachment style, you might be wondering where you can find others with secure attachment styles. There are certainly attributes to look for in people with secure attachment styles and surrounding yourself with these types of people is a great way to grow healthy, stable relationships.

Here’s what to look for when you’re searching for others with secure attachment styles:

Whether you’re developing your own secure attachment or looking for someone who has one, knowing more about the topic — and how you personally relate to others — can help you. We’ll be the first to admit that relationships are complicated, so having a therapist to help you sort through your feelings, experiences, and needs is a great way to practice feeling secure.

Zencare is the simplest way to find your ideal therapist. Browse therapist videos and book a free phone call to find a great fit! Our women-led team is based in Brooklyn, NY.

Your attachment style is how you routinely interact, connect, and engage with the people around you. Read on to learn more about the different types of attachment and how they play out across adulthood.

It’s completely possible to revise your attachment style, though it takes constant practice to learn a new way of connecting with others. The first step, however, is to learn about fearful avoidant attachment style — which is why we’ve answered your questions.

If commitment, intimacy, and closeness aren’t your thing this may be a result of your attachment style, not a reflection on how much you care. So what is an avoidant attachment style? And what can you do about it? We’re here to give you everything you need to know.

# Ways To Change An Attachment Style: How To Create A Secure Attachment | BetterHelp

Attachment theory describes the way in which human connection is established in a person's life, starting from emotional development early childhood between a child and their primary caregivers. This attachment can impact future relationships as an adult, including those with one's own children, friends, partners, and lovers. The child's interaction with their attachment figure can form one of the four main attachment styles.

In some cases, factors such as abuse, trauma, or difficulties in a child's life can lead to an insecure attachment style, such as avoidant attachment or ambivalent attachment. For those with insecure styles, learning to develop a secure attachment may feel impossible or challenging due to existing attachment issues or emotional problems.

A 2020 study found that it is possible to change your attachment style and become less anxious or avoidant over time, with the intention of working toward a secure attachment style.

The attachment theory, first published by psychologist John Bowlby, aimed to understand why infants experienced psychological distress when separated from their mothers, impacting their childhood development. He found that infants and young children displayed different behavioral patterns, influenced by how securely attached children felt in relation to their caregivers.

His colleague, Mary Ainsworth, expanded on this theory by hypothesizing that there were several main attachment styles and identifying them accordingly. Observing the varying ways children reacted to attachment-related challenges, she classified their responses into one of the following main attachment styles, highlighting the significance of emotional cues, body language, nonverbal communication in forming these connections.

In securely attached adults, individuals feel safe expressing their own emotions, communicating with others, and setting boundaries. People with secure attachments tend to experience higher self-esteem and may not feel anxious or worried about their place in someone's life, trusting that people love and care about them without much reassurance.

Often, secure attachment starts when babies form connections through consistent and responsive caregiving. Here, the baby learns to trust their caregivers to meet their needs, fostering a sense of safety and emotional connection that minimizes the baby's stress. Consistent caregiver actions such as compassionate nursing and bottle feeding can influence the individual to have a more secure attachment style throughout their lifespan. 

When facing an unhealthy relationship, they may feel confident in cutting off contact or removing themselves from the situation. They often don't avoid conflict, difficult conversations, or the emotional needs of others. These securely attached adults understand that emotions are an essential part of being human, and they are better equipped to form healthy relationships, including intimate relationships and romantic relationships.

There are four insecure unhealthy attachment styles, including the following:

Anxious-preoccupied: Those with this attachment style may question the intentions of others, often worry about being abandoned, or feel intense jealousy. They may go to great lengths to avoid being harmed, often ask for reassurance, and experience low self-esteem.

Dismissive-avoidant: Those with this attachment style may avoid emotional conversations or topics, keep their relationships at a distance, and shame others for their deeper feelings. They may feel uncomfortable or not know how to express their own feelings. They may reject openness or vulnerability.

Fearful-avoidant: Those with this attachment style crave intimacy and vulnerability but may become fearful or uneasy when they have it. They may end relationships early, stay busy to avoid others, or avoid intimate behaviors.

Disorganized: Those with a disorganized attachment style may struggle with features of several insecure types. They may go back and forth between avoiding intimacy and craving it. In some instances, they may ask for reassurance and become frightened; in others, they may become angry, cold, or distant.

An insecure attachment style may develop from abuse, abandonment, or a rocky relationship with a caregiver or parent. No perfect parent exists, but understanding how a child feels in the strange situation of developing an insecure attachment can help caregivers work towards helping them develop a secure attachment.

As you become an adult, your attachment style may reflect the behaviors you took on to defend yourself in a complex relationship when you were younger. For example, you may be avoidant of the emotions of others due to having an emotionally volatile parent who asked you to care for their emotional state. Or you may crave reassurance or become frightened due to a parent who was distant, neglectful, or didn't meet your needs. It is better to talk to a counselor if you feel like your attachment style turned into one of those unhealthy attachment styles.

Becoming more secure may feel highly challenging at times. Unlearning patterns from childhood that your family could have taught you may take time. However, a recent study shows that learning or re-learning security is possible. In the study, 46% of participants changed their attachment style within the course of two years. 

Consider the following methods of encouraging a secure attachment style in your own life.

Boundaries may be rules that you set for yourself, your body, your space, and your belongings. Consider the following examples of boundaries:

Not letting your niece eat on your new couch

Asking a partner not to touch your face without asking

Telling someone you're not interested in dating them

Saying "no" to sex

Telling someone you need a day to think before answering their question

Rejecting a job offer

Not letting your little sister use your makeup without asking

Ending a relationship that is harming you

Telling a boss what you need to stay in a position

Boundaries do not control someone else's behavior. Others may still have the right to set their own boundaries about themselves or their belongings. Confidence in your limits may help you create a healthier connection with someone you love. 

If you struggle to say "no" or bring up your needs, practice boundaries on your own first. Practice saying "no" in the mirror or ask a friend to bring up requests for you to decline. You may start small, as well. For example, you might practice saying "no" to water at a friend’s house or decline an offer to take an overtime shift at your job.

For those with insecure attachment styles, you may not know how to communicate emotions, needs, or ideas. Or you might struggle to understand when to take time away, give someone space, or let go of a harmful situation. 

Learning to communicate when you don't have a healthy example may sometimes feel impossible. However, there are various resources available to help, including:

Therapy with an attachment/trauma therapist

Couples therapy

Books

Online quizzes

Articles and online resources

Online or in-person support groups

Communication courses

You may benefit from deciding to communicate more often with those you're in close relationships with if you usually avoid conversation. If you typically initiate conversation or struggle with taking space, you may find relief from journaling your feelings or taking time out before asking to converse with someone else. 

This exercise may help to get you to a "middle ground" where you can healthily communicate or take space without extreme fear, anger, or upset. 

If you struggle to identify or understand emotions, it may help you to create an "emotions chart." There are several widely known emotions, including:

Anger

Sadness

Happiness

Fear

Disgust

Jealousy

Envy

Love

Excitement

Desire

Willingness

Contentment

Contempt

If visual aids help you, consider printing out a visual chart of emotions. When you feel something and aren't sure what it is, ask yourself if it matches any of the pictures or labels on the emotions chart. Doing this exercise may help you name your emotions when others ask you, "how are you feeling?" 

In some cases, long-term periods of one emotional state may be due to mental health conditions or mental illness. For example, extended periods of profound sadness may be depression, and frequent feelings of fear and worry may be due to anxiety. Speaking to a counselor may also be a beneficial option for you.

Studies show that humans need social connections to feel safe and healthy, both physically and mentally. For this reason, finding safe and healthy relationships may be valuable for your health. 

Unsafe relationships could cause an insecure attachment style to be more apparent, and you may not feel safe in creating a secure attachment. In a secure attachment, you may leave a relationship or be able to pick up on "red flags" before a relationship starts. If you're already in an unhealthy relationship, it may not be possible to work on your attachment style until you leave and are in a safe environment. 

Someone who is safe and healthy to form a relationship or friendship with may fit the following behaviors:

They are open about their feelings and thoughts but can self-control and practice self-care when needed

They offer emotional support, kindness, and validation when they can

They do not belittle, threaten, or mislabel you

They respect your sexuality, gender identity, and pronouns

They express interest in spending time with you

They do not yell, intimidate, or throw things

They do not physically harm you

They respect your boundaries, including physical, emotional, and sexual ones

They practice active listening when you bring a concern to them

They are open-minded

They understand that no one is perfect and that mistakes can happen

They communicate when they need space or time away from the relationship

They are empathetic and compassionate

They have goals, ambitions, and desires unique to them

They have a strong sense of identity

You may find people who do not fit all these criteria, which may be okay to you. Not everyone will have healthy skills from the get-go. However, the relationship is probably not safe for you if you are experiencing threats, insults, physical or emotional abuse, or bullying. 

It may feel too challenging to work through attachment behaviors alone. You may not have a healthy example in your life or want advice from a professional. In this case, counseling can be a valuable option. Online counseling could benefit those who feel most comfortable at home or have busy schedules. 

Studies show that online cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) effectively treats long-term exposure to stress and trauma and the symptoms that may go with that. Further studies show that a compassionate and focused therapist can effectively treat attachment disorders or insecure attachment styles. 

If you're interested in meeting with a counselor to discuss this topic further, online platforms such as BetterHelp offer an extensive database of counselors with experience in various concerns, such as trauma, anxiety, and attachment. 

Read below for counselor reviews from BetterHelp users who have expressed similar concerns. 

”Kerrie is very responsive and supportive. She attends to what I’m saying and finds ways to help me make connections between my thoughts, feelings, and experiences that move me towards my goals. I thoroughly enjoy working with her and appreciate the insights she offers in our sessions.”

”I am so grateful to have found such a wonderful counselor. I finally have a safe place to talk through the darkest parts of my life and continue to receive practical advice that I can actually use to cope with and heal from my trauma, and be more comfortable in my day-to-day life. I could not be more pleased with the counselor I was matched with and I look forward to every session, even if the discussion topics are rough or painful. I would 100% recommend him to anyone I know.”



A person can become more secure in their attachments. An unofficial “fifth” attachment style, earned-secure, refers to those who started with an insecure attachment style but later developed the ability to understand their circumstances, collaborate with others, reflect on their childhood, and rationalize the source of their insecure attachment. 

The Attachment Project, an organization that helps people develop an earned-secure attachment style, describes how to improve secure attachment in four major steps:

Moving from insecure attachment to earned-secure attachment may be easier with the help of a therapist. A mental health professional can help you understand your attachment style, what factors contribute to it, and what you can do to become more secure. 

The attachment process begins early in childhood, and a secure attachment style develops when children have attentive parents who make the child feel secure. The child can obtain comfort from their caregivers when distressed, and the caregiver is usually typically warm and nurturing. Securely attached children can also use their parents as a “secure base” to explore the environment and interact with other children. This is noticeable in toddlers, who may venture away from their parents to play but often glance back to their parents and search for them if they are not in sight. 

As the child grows older, the important features of attachment remain. Parents often enforce security by providing a nonjudgmental atmosphere for adolescents to discuss problems or seek support. A caregiver often provides extensive emotional support and helps their teen learn how to navigate complex adult emotions. Generally, a strong parent-child relationship in childhood and adolescence predicts a secure adult attachment style, which can be beneficial across the entirety of a person’s lifespan. 

A secure-attachment relationship is typically characterized by openness, trust, empathetic communication, and independence. Both people who began adulthood with a secure attachment style and those who attained earned-secure attachment exhibit similar relationship traits. A few characteristics of a securely attached person in a relationship are listed below: 

The most effective - and possibly only - way to fix insecure attachment in a child is to improve their caregiving environment.  In extreme cases, such as when child abuse is present, removing the child from the parents may be the only viable solution. Typical human development usually requires extensive emotional scaffolding from caregivers. Evidence suggests that children can form new attachments with more secure caregivers, and providing children with a safe, secure environment will likely reduce future attachment concerns. 

In most cases, a child remains with their caregiver and invested parents often strive to make changes in their own behavior to create a more secure and attentive environment. Standardized parenting programs, which help caregivers learn to communicate empathetically, raise their emotional awareness, and adopt new parenting skills, have been shown to increase attachment security in children when followed appropriately.

Parents and caregivers may wish to work with a mental health professional to gain insight into their own attachment style. Considering a parent’s caregiving style is often equally important as analyzing a child’s attachment style. Many parents notice large gains in their and their child’s personal security when they commit to moving from an insecure to an earned-secure attachment style. Parents who have attained earned-secure attachment often report that it is much easier to remain attuned to their child's needs, show empathy, and see their child as independent. 

An emotionally secure child needs a safe environment and a nurturing response from caregivers. A child’s ability to engage in healthy relationships as an adult likely requires a solid foundation of emotional security in childhood. Experts suggest that there are five conditions necessary to raise a securely attached child: 

A secure attachment style in an adult relationship refers to a person’s ability to engage in healthy, trusting relationships. Insecurely attached people may find it difficult to trust or rely on others for emotional support, which can lead to problems in adult relationships, especially romantic ones. On the other hand, securely attached people often thrive in healthy unions and are usually willing to work on their current relationships. They can generally engage in empathetic communication and trust others easily. 

Both secure and insecure attachment styles are formed during childhood. Securely-attached children tend to have parents who provide for their emotional needs as well as basic necessities. They are usually able to approach their parents for comfort and are made to feel known, safe, and valued. On the other hand, insecure attachments tend to develop when parents do not provide a child with safety, security, or emotional support. 

Consider a romantic relationship between two people: Mark and Kaylee. Mark and Kaylee both have secure attachment styles, which are demonstrated through the daily interactions of their relationship. After a hard day at work, Kaylee comes home to Mark and discusses her day with him constructively. Mark listens attentively, empathizes with Kaylee, and offers emotional support. He is concerned about his girlfriend’s well-being, and her request for emotional support is welcomed. 

The next week, Kaylee leaves on a 10-day trip for work. Mark isn’t concerned about her absence and looks forward to some extra time to work on his goals. Neither Kaylee nor Mark are worried about potential threats to their relationship; they both find each other trustworthy and have completely internalized that trust. Although Mark and Kaylee will miss each other, neither one is distressed by spending some time apart. Their secure attachments allow them to have deep, loving connections without sacrificing their independence. 

Dr. Daniel Siegel coined the four S’s of secure attachment in his book The Power of Showing Up. Dr. Siegel is a psychiatrist who has worked extensively with children, teenagers, and families. The Power of Showing Up describes how consistent support from at least one adult can help a child become successful academically, improve their career prospects, and improve their future relationships. 

Dr. Siegel’s four S’s are steeped in attachment theory and are based on the latest research regarding how parents and caregivers can best support their children. The four S’s are briefly described below: 

Securely attached adults tend to have the ability to engage in healthy relationships, communicate openly, and trust others. They are usually aware of their emotions and emotional needs, being able to express the need for support when necessary. They can also typically reflect on and learn from past relationships easily. 

Generally speaking, there are three key signs that a person has a secure attachment style:

# What Is a Secure Attachment Style and How to Develop It

How you approach relationships as an adult has a lot to do with what your childhood relationship was like with your parents or primary caregivers.

This phenomenon, known as attachment theory, was coined by British psychologist John Bowlby. 

There are four different types of attachment styles, the healthiest being secure attachment, People with a secure attachment style typically have successful, happy relationships.

To develop a secure attachment style,young children typically must have a healthy bond with at least one primary caregiver in order to have healthy social and emotional development, says Erika Beckles Camez, PhD, LMFT, therapist and founder of Live Well Family Counseling Services.

Here's what it means to have a secure attachment style, what causes it to develop, and how you can develop it later in life. 

Secure attachment style can show up in many ways in both childhood and adulthood.

Beckles Camez says some characteristics in childhood include:

These healthy traits carry over from childhood to adulthood and allow you to feel confident in your self-expression and more secure in your relationships, says Sasha Jackson, MSW, LCSW, social worker in private practice. 

A 2015 study found that compared to those with avoidant or anxious attachment styles, people with a secure attachment style were more likely to have a positive sense of self, feel cared for by others, and greater feelings of closeness with other people.

In adulthood, Beckles Camez says characteristics of a secure attachment style are: 

"Secure attachment is developed by having positive consistent feedback of safety, trust, protection, a sense of belonging, comfort, reliability, and positivity from the attachment figure," says Jackson. 

It's crucial that a child feels safe, seen, and valued. As humans, we value acknowledgement, validation, and connection. This makes us feel like we belong and are appreciated, Jackson says.

This can show up in various ways throughout the years. Beckles Camez says some examples of positive childhood experiences that can lead to a secure attachment style are when caregivers:

Experiencing these positive situations throughout your upbringing can help set the stage for you to do the same when you are older in your interpersonal relationships, whether that's your familial, romantic, or platonic relationships. 

Even if you didn't have an upbringing that fostered a secure attachment style and you have an anxious or avoidant attachment style, it's still possible to develop a secure one as an adult.

"Purposely developing a secure attachment starts with your emotional awareness on how you feel about yourself, your ability to be loved, and your ability to be safe," says Jackson. 

Take a good hard look at how your current attachment style is affecting your current relationships. It's likely that the people you have close bonds with have the same attachment style as you. Jackson says we tend to attract people with similar attachment styles because it's familiar.

Jackson says some steps you can take to develop a secure attachment style are:

Any type of therapy with a mental health professional can help you to become more self-aware, identify unhealthy habits, and work through trauma. Beckles Camez recommends EFT (Emotionally-focused therapy) in particular, since it was developed around the principles of attachment theory. It can be conducted in individual therapy or couples therapy.

EFT can help you learn how you may have developed unhealthy coping strategies in response to past emotional trauma, and it can provide couples with tools to see how these unhealthy strategies create negative patterns that can prevent meaningful emotional connection and secure attachment, says Beckles Camez.

A secure attachment style typically develops in childhood, when a child experiences a healthy upbringing with emotionally available caregivers. 

Witnessing good examples from caregivers and having this attachment style can help you form secure relationships later in life. 

If you have an avoidant or anxious attachment style rather than a secure one, it is possible to change if you put in the work. 

Don't hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional to get started on your journey towards secure attachment.

# Secure Attachment: Definition, Importance, and How to Form

The emotional connection formed by nonverbal emotional communication between an infant and their parent or primary caregiver is known as the attachment bond. 

This bond is not based on love or the quality of the care a parent or caretaker gives a child, but on wordless emotional communication.

Attachment will occur naturally, but, according to attachment theory, the quality of the bond is critical to a child’s future.

Learn more about secure attachment, what it means, and how to develop one with your child.

Attachment theory is based on the first relationship that a child has, and how that relationship influences the child’s mental development.

This theory has evolved from contributions by many researchers, primarily Mary Ainsworth and John Bowlby. It focuses on a mother’s ability to be sensitive and responsive to her infant’s needs, and how that impacts the infant’s development of trust, resilience, and confidence as they grow up.

A secure attachment bond that meets a child’s need for security, calm, and understanding allows for optimal development of the child’s nervous system. 

A child’s developing brain organizes itself to provide a foundation based on a feeling of safety. As a child matures, this foundation can result in: 

According to the Georgia Department of Human Service (GDHS), infants who are securely attached have learned they can trust other people to take care of them. They tend to:

An insecure attachment bond — one that does not meet a child’s need for security, calm, and understanding — can hinder a child’s brain development for optimal organization. It can also restrain mental, emotional, and physical development. 

All this can result in learning problems and difficulty in forming relationships as the child matures.

According to the GDHS, infants who are insecurely attached do not trust easily, having learned that adults are not reliable. They tend to:

According to experts at Harvard University, healthy development from birth to age 3 sets the stage for:

Attachment is a result of a dynamic and interactive exchange of nonverbal emotional cues. This process makes your baby feel safe and understood. Your baby picks up on your emotional cues, such as your gestures and your tone of voice.

Your baby is also signaling you with crying and gestures such as mimicking facial expressions, pointing, as well as cooing, and laughing. As you pick up on your baby’s signals, respond with affection and warmth.

Your baby is nonverbal, and when you understand their nonverbal cues you give them a sense of recognition, comfort, and safety. Nonverbal communication that you can use to help build a secure attachment bond include:

Secure attachment is only one of a variety of influences — such as cultural norms and individual personality differences — that affect a child’s process for:

Attachments between an infant and a primary caregiver begin developing at birth through one-to-one interactions. These early interactions affect the brain, establishing patterns for how a child will develop relationships as they mature.

The brains of infants who form secure attachments have a greater foundation or ability to form healthy relationships. Children whose first attachments are insecure or negative may have difficulty forming healthy relationships.

You can develop a secure attachment with your baby through nonverbal emotional interactions such as reassuring touches, attentive eye contact, and a warm, affectionate tone of voice.

# How to Develop Secure Attachment

Do you want to develop a secure attachment style, but don’t know where to begin?

Then, you’re in the right place.

Today, you’ll learn how to develop secure attachment from building security in relationships to fixing insecure attachment styles once and for all. 

Ready to create a secure attachment style for yourself (and/or your partner)? Let’s get started.

Want to know what your attachment style is? Take the quiz! 

Attachment styles are the way we attach to others. From The Attachment Theory by John Bowlby, attachment styles are developed during our childhood and affect our adult relationships as we mature. Every adult is one of four unique attachment styles.

Curious how we develop these four types? That’s next.

According to The Attachment Theory, we develop our outlook on relationships, our “style,” during childhood. It is through the first relationships we have with parents or caretakers that create our attachment styles and thus, dictate our adult relationships. It is due to these relationships that we as adults might feel things like we’re being abandoned or dismissive of our romantic partners.

There are four attachment styles:



1. Anxious (Open Hearts)

Anxious adults generally want a lot of closeness from their partners. They may struggle with feeling unworthy of love.

2. Avoidant (Rolling Stones)

Rooted in a fear of love, avoidant adults typically fear closeness and avoid commitment. These individuals usually want more space from their partners.

3. Disorganized (Spice of Lifers) 

Disorganized adults deal with insecurity and may display unpredictable behaviors. They may want closeness, but also fear being close at the same time.

4. Secure (Cornerstones) 

Adults who are overall open to relationships and have a positive self-image are considered to have a secure attachment style. They are comfortable with intimacy.

We’re here to discuss how to develop secure attachment, the fourth attachment style, so let’s dive into that in greater detail. 

Having a secure attachment style in relationships begins with oneself. It’s an internal experience.

The illusion of “a perfect relationship” is typically defined by one that is long-term and committed. But, being in a long-term relationship does not indicate a secure (nor a perfect) relationship. You can be single and have a secure attachment style.

I talk more about this in my “What is Secure Attachment in Relationship” video: 



I like to call Secure people “Cornerstones.” Generally, Cornerstones are comfortable with intimacy in a relationship, which looks like…

Want to know what your attachment style is? Take the quiz! 

Now that you know a few common characteristics of someone with a secure attachment style, let’s look at some other traits. If you are a secure individual or are dating one, you may hear them say things like:



Does this sound far-fetched?? That’s okay! You can build secure attachment in relationships. That’s what we’ll look at next.

You CAN learn how to develop secure attachment from insecure attachment. It starts with looking at and learning from role models and relationships that are secure.

There are six signs of a secure relationship:

For more on these six signs, watch my video on the topic:



In short, feeling secure in a relationship is a combination of authenticity, consistency, and honesty. In order to achieve and build this sense of security, there are two parts to focus on.

Emotional safety stems from a sense of felt security and accomplishing this is twofold. 

First, you must develop a basic belief that you are valuable and will be okay, no matter what. Nothing anyone else says or does detract from your value or your right to need and want what you do. This is an ultimate internal feeling of security.

Secondly, we feel secure when we know what to expect.

Knowing what to expect stems from trusting a partner to do what they say and say what they mean. This means their inner and outer worlds are aligned, and their actions are reflections of what they really feel and think on the inside.

In the context of relationships, one must also trust that they care about your wellbeing and have your best interests at heart. This requires a robust emotional vocabulary (more on that soon).

Many of us have a powerful fantasy of what a secure relationship might look like, but few of us have seen it in action. Oftentimes, insecurely attached people don’t feel safe enough to express true intimate passion. That’s because the pillars of a secure relationship are not in place. 

For example, you might experience the thrill of infatuation and obsess over every detail of the relationship, but this can keep you spinning your wheels, focusing on someone or something outside of yourself, that prevents you from really connecting to them, through a connection to your most authentic self, first.. It leads to a frequent compromising of your true self and “Inner Being” – and that renders you subject to your conditions, and things outside of your control, which fan the flames of attachment insecurity. As you try to avoid rejection by giving more to your partner, you wind up losing yourself.

True intimate passion – what you feel in a secure relationship – cannot exist in this type of environment, for anyone. 

Because  at the root of it, these actions come from a place where the insecure partner feels unworthy or “not good enough”

So, how do you connect to your authentic self? It’s reliant upon your ability to connect to your feelings and emotions. This means building a robust emotional vocabulary. 



A history of emotional abandonment, invasion, or dismissal (the things that cause insecure attachment), makes it hard to develop a robust emotional vocabulary. Without it, it is difficult to know who the authentic self really is. That makes it hard to know and trust our own feelings and emotions. 

Often, I have received the question from clients and from my online community members, “How can I trust my intuition, when my nervous system is so reactive? How do I know if my feelings are real?”

Thoughts and feelings can only be described in what few terms insecure attachment styles understand. As a result, these terms are oversimplified and black and white. We say things like, “I feel good” or “I feel bad” or “I feel happy” or “I feel sad.” These vague responses offer little clarity or definition around our reasons for doing things, and the nuances of the more subtle emotions these umbrella terms encompass. 

For example, feeling “good” could encompass a wide range and tapestry of more subtle and intersecting ambiguous emotional experiences, such as “anticipation, nervousness, excitement, anxiety, impatience, joy, exhilaration, calm, contentment, curiosity”…and more. The better we are at teasing out these subtleties, the less confused and overwhelmed we feel by our emotions, and thus, the more secure we are, overall.

Anxious partners might say, “I need my partner, I can’t explain why… they are the ones for me. There is so much potential; I can make it work. I will compromise, if only they would tell me what they want.” 

For an avoidant partner, they might express, “I don’t know why it isn’t working, something just doesn’t feel right. My partner is great, but we aren’t a good fit. I don’t really know how I feel, but I can’t keep leading them on. It’s just making things worse.”

Notice how a more robust emotional vocabulary could offer a lot more clarity and definition to these vague statements, and with that clarity comes a better ability to problem solve, along with feelings of being more confident and secure within yourself, and your partnership. Building a better emotional vocabulary and developing emotional safety starts with changing how one thinks and reacts. That’s next.

Having a secure attachment style means doing what you say, and saying what you mean. To break that down, you must maintain a state of “congruence” between your inner and outer world. This requires access to your inner being and emotional clarity. 

The actions of people with secure attachment are authentic reflections of what they feel and think on the inside. In a nutshell, “what you see is what you get.” They think and react with confidence.

For insecurely attached individuals, this feels more like  “wearing your heart on your sleeve” and leaves them feeling vulnerable. They think and react while hiding their true feelings. This leads to game-playing or hot-cold experiences like:

Insecure partners thinking and reacting this way is, in essence, a repetition of the early abandonment insecure  partners experienced as children. 

To create an emotionally safe environment in a relationship, both partners need to practice congruence with everything that they do. In short, they both have to follow through with what they tell one another.

When both partners start acting this way, they’ll start seeing the six signs of a secure relationship that we discussed earlier.

Want to know what your attachment style is? Take the quiz! 

Can you create a secure attachment style? Yes, but you need to do it in the right way. Hint: becoming a secure individual is not just “self-improvement” – it’s a lot more than that.

This process takes time and patience as there’s no overnight, quick fix. Here’s what you need to know. 

Yes. Many people never change their attachment style, but YOU have the power to do so if you choose. You can change your attachment style to become more secure and less avoidant or less anxious.

In my community, I get a lot of questions like, “Why am I still single when I’ve been doing everything right?” or “How can I heal myself so I can finally find and deserve a secure partner?”

If you continue to approach it from this perspective, like an A to B equation, it will take a LONG time to get to where you’re going. Instead, to fix your insecure attachment, you must shift your perception of what it means to be “secure.” 

You can fix your attachment style over time and feel better about relationships, but it starts with perspective. The first perspective to shift is that secure attachment is NOT a measure for the success of your relationship. Security is felt INTERNALLY.

When I start with students in my online courses, I recommend they ask themselves:

By asking yourself these questions, you are helping yourself to create boundaries. You are identifying and creating the vision of what it is you actually want in a relationship.



The second perspective to shift is how you view situations you find yourself in. Many people try to fix their insecure attachment by fixing the “wrong” thing. Let me explain with an example of “worrying in a relationship” and how you can shift your perspective to see it more as a secure attachment would.

When we first arrive at attachment styles, we let our needs, our behaviors, and our external circumstances define who and what we are. For example, an anxiously attached person thinks they’re anxious because they may worry a lot. They assume a secure person doesn’t worry, therefore, they think, “If I worry less, then I’ll be secure.”

But the difference is not the worry; the difference is how identified an anxious person is with their worry, versus how unidentified a secure person is with the same worry. 

Why? The presence (or absence) of identification, amplifies or de-amplifies the worry’s effect.

The more identified we are with worry, the more we allow the worry to color the lenses through which we perceive the world and its possibilities. Without realizing it, the very worry we’re trying to avoid is compelling us in predictable ways so we fall into the same traps.

The less identified we are with our worry, the more we might take a pause between the sensation, take a step back, and decide how to better act upon it. 

How do we create this pause? We ask questions about the worry we’re experiencing. Some internal dialogue might look like this:

“Whoa, let’s do a reality check before we go making assumptions. Does this actually have anything to do with me? If not, it doesn’t mean I have no control or that I am not special to them. It just means it’s their problem and they have to work it out.”

In other words, secure attachments have a better grasp of emotional boundaries so they don’t take everything so personally. 

When secure individuals experience stressful events, they recognize they are upset and can create this space or pause. Secure people are motivated to manage stress and some may even draw closer to their partners physically and emotionally to increase closeness and intimacy. This comes from a tendency to resolve problems constructively and through problem-solving coping strategies – something that insecure individuals may not possess.

However, don’t interpret that as you need to find a partner to become more secure within yourself;You can fix insecure attachment styles and build a secure attachment styles while being single, like I explain in this video:



What happens when we don’t pause to question the worry?

When you immediately act on the worry that compels you, you are going to receive a reinforcing response from the environment (for example, a triggering response from an avoidant partner) that only keeps you caught in a cycle of never-ending worry.

In reality, they are operating in the same way you are but on the equal and opposite side of the coping continuum of behaviors and attitudes. 

So, being secure doesn’t mean the worry isn’t there, but it does mean you have more free will and spaciousness inside to buffer its effect. You are the part that observes the worry and makes decisions about it. You have control over your perspective.

From that position, worry doesn’t scare you so much anymore. Accomplishing the observer position is great, but that’s step one. There’s more to the story…

To change from insecure to secure attachment, you can also take a more direct and effective approach with body-based interventions. 

When we have lived our life the same way for decades, it’s hard to change our perspective on a biological level. Your neurons have carved a synaptic groove in your brain and the cells of your body carry a pattern of reactivity to certain kinds of situations. Let’s call it “temperament,” but typical reactions are ingrained within us on a deeper level.

To explain, let’s continue with the worrying example from earlier. If you worry about how much you notice yourself worrying, that explains this deeper level – and that’s double trouble. 

I go into this in more detail in my video: How To Achieve Secure Attachment Fast (NOT “Self-Improvement”).



 

Moving towards secure attachment, you must allow more spaciousness within you to make more informed decisions. This happens internally as you learn how to connect to your own insecurities and form self-acceptance. Eventually, those uncertain feelings will dissipate. 

There is no quick fix to this. This process is achieved through witnessing, observing and becoming tolerant of your own insecurities – and continued practice. In the meantime, just try to retrain your mind to reframe negative thoughts into statements of affirmation, and you will move towards a more secure orientation. 

There you have it! Now you know how to develop secure attachment. 

It takes consistency and work, but if you can reframe your beliefs and behaviors, then you can actually be MORE fully yourself. Becoming secure is not changing who you are, it is unfolding into who you have always been on a soul level.

# Attachment styles, what they are and how they affect your love life •

Have you had some rough relationships? Feel like your mood and emotions are a roller coaster when you’re dating? Do serious relationships make you feel suffocated? Do you feel unnecessary anxiety about your relationship? Does the thought of getting close to someone scare the shit out of you?

If you answered yes to any of these, perhaps you have an insecure attachment style. Have no idea what that is? You’ve come to the right place to find out. Over the past five years, I learned everything I could about attachment styles and now I’m going to relay that juicy information to you. Having this knowledge will help you understand your behaviour in dating and relationships. It’ll also help you understand your current partner’s behaviour (or future people you date) so you can have healthier and more fulfilling relationships. How good is that?  

Let’s get stuck in. This is a longer blog, so grab a coffee or a martini, whatever works for you.

Attachment theory is an area of psychology dating back to the 1950s, characterising how you behave in relationships and has been studied by psychologists and psychiatrists for 100’s of years. Your attachment style is formed in early childhood with your parents or guardians and is the basis for how you approach social situations and relationships through your life.  

There are four main attachment styles. Secure, anxious, avoidant (or dismissive) and anxious-avoidant. Apart from the secure attachment style, the other three attachment styles are insecure. They just present in different ways, with different behaviours and fears. Ultimately, insecure attachment styles struggle with trusting love and managing their emotions in relationships in a healthy way.

If you don’t know your attachment style, here is an awesome test. It might be best to do the test, then come back here and continue reading. The test will give you percentages of each attachment style you have. 

I’ve taken this test at different points in my life and received different results, so before you continue, please know your attachment style can change with different partners. You can also exhibit behaviours from different attachment styles at different times. A securely attached person may become anxious with an avoidant partner, or an avoidant could become secure with a secure partner, and so on.

People with secure attachments are comfortable with intimacy, being vulnerable and setting boundaries. They are able to function in relationships in a healthy way and walk away if their needs are not being met or if they are being treated poorly. They are comfortable with a natural progression of a relationship and don’t fear their partners playing a large role in their life. 

Securely attached folk probably grew up in a safe household where they were shown emotional availability and love from their parents consistently. Their parents likely acted as good role models for them to understand healthy relationships. Securely attached people can still have relationship issues, like anyone, but how they relate to their partners is more secure and safe compared to the insecure styles. 

Behaviours of securely attached people:

Avoidants are fiercely independent, can be uncomfortable with intimacy and can feel smothered by ‘normal’ relationship steps. Deep down, they fear losing their independence, being misunderstood or getting hurt if they let down their walls, so they build their life in a way that makes it hard for people to get close to them. They’re often single for long periods and may only get into surface level relationships with people whom they don’t really love. As this blog put it so well, “Avoidants will let you be around them, but they won’t let you in”.

An avoidant attachment style is formed by having parents who were emotionally unavailable or not around much in infancy, causing a child to distance themselves emotionally and be forced to learn how to do life alone. They then carry these characteristics into their adult relationships.

People with an avoidant attachment style can struggle with vulnerability and their partners can feel like they don’t really know them on a deeper level, often craving more intimacy than they might be able to give. If they do meet someone who they truly love, they may still leave, sabotage the relationship or not let their partner in. Their behaviours and fears mean they can miss out on the love and connection they truly crave, like any normal human. Men are more likely to be avoidant than women.

Behaviours of avoidant attached people:

People with an anxious attachment style generally need a lot of reassurance in a relationship. They struggle with vagueness and need to know how their partners feel about them with direct actions and words to help them feel safe. If they don’t know where they stand with someone, they can become anxious, desperately looking for reassurance and often pushing people away. 

An anxious attachment style is formed by having parents who were inconsistent. Sometimes they may have been supportive and responsive to the child and other times, they were absent or misattuned. This parenting pattern made it difficult for them to understand what the parents’ behaviour means, which they then carry into their adult relationships.

Anxiously attached people are very attuned to changes in moods and situations, often believing there is a problem in a relationship when there might not be. This can cause them to lash out or have a large (often unnecessary) emotional reaction, making a problem bigger than it needed to be. Anxious folk crave intimacy and closeness. Deep down, they fear being abandoned, have low self esteem and often don’t trust relationships to work out. Women are more likely to have an anxious style.

Behaviours of anxiously attached people:

Often called the disorganised or fearful-avoidant attachment style, they are a mix of the avoidant style and the anxious style. They crave intimacy but are equally scared when it happens.

Anxious-avoidants avoid intimacy out of fear of its potential to hurt them, whereas avoidants often prefer to be alone. Anxious-avoidants aren’t so great at sorting through their emotions. Sometimes they can have intense emotional outbursts and other times, they suppress their feelings. They don’t seek help when they need it, even though deep down they actually want it. Anxious-avoidants can also have other mental health problems such as depression, substance abuse or anxiety. They only equate to a very small percentage of the population.

Behaviours of the anxious-avoidant attached people:

When I first started learning about this, I felt down on myself and felt regret about some of my behaviour in my previous relationships. I just wanted to feel ‘normal’ or secure. As I’ve come to learn more about how I am, I started to see the good in some of the anxious parts. I believe my anxious attachment makes me empathetic to a fault. It’s probably half the reason I have this blog, because I want to help people who might feel a bit shit like I have. If you’re anxious like me, you might need a lot of reassurance in a relationship, but you’ll give a hell of a lot too. I’ll also bet you have outstanding emotional intelligence with not only your partner but all your friends. Not so bad, hey? 

If you’re avoidant, your ability to be independent and take care of yourself is incredible and often inspiring to other people. This quote in a book I’ve recommended below is something to keep in mind when learning about attachments. You’re welcome!

“Instead of thinking how you can change yourself in order to please your partner, as so many relationship books advise, think: Can this person provide what I need in order to be happy?”

Your attachment styles can certainly change and evolve with work and awareness. Our attachment style can also change with different partners and at different times in our lives. A secure person can become anxiously attached to an avoidant person. An anxiously attached style can become more secure with a secure partner. A secure person may also display anxious or avoidant behaviours through a low or difficult time in their life.

For transparency (and maybe a little hope if you’re like me), I was anxiously attached, moving towards secure. For even more transparency, you can read about my experience with domestic violence here. This is a big part of the reason I get anxious in relationships. If other people have been through something similar, it could help you understand their attachment style too.

I worked on my attachment style and went to therapy as I knew it was hurting me and my relationships. After years of hard work, my communication skills and thought patterns are far better and I understand my needs in a relationship now. Stoked for myself. So if I can do it, you can too.

Understanding your attachment style, learning about it and recognising when you’re displaying attachment behaviour is a massive step toward having healthier relationships. Learning this will help your dating life too. You’ll be able to recognise the insecure styles and notice and change your own behaviour. Secure attachment styles are also best for the insecure styles. They are not as triggered by some of our insecure behaviour (if it is communicated in a healthy way and worked on). 

Therapy did so much for me. It pulled me out of a dark hole, taught me about myself and truly helped me function in a more healthy way in relationships. If I went to therapy years ago, perhaps my other relationships would have worked out a little better. If you’re not ready to chat your problems away, or can’t afford it (that shit be expensive), I’ve listed loads of free resources at the bottom of this page.

If you’re secure and in a relationship with an insecure style, firstly thanks for sticking around. Learning about their style can help you understand them and be patient. Having this knowledge might also help you feel more compassionate when they’re displaying some attachment behaviours. Again, check out the resources below.

Have you been in a roller coaster relationship or perhaps know a couple who are always breaking up and getting back together? People who can’t quite seem to figure their shit out? It could be an anxious-avoidant relationship. 

These two insecure styles are often drawn to each other. They confirm each other’s beliefs and insecurities. This doesn’t mean they don’t genuinely love each other. What it means is they need very different things in a relationship and those things can be the opposite. The anxious style wants intimacy, while the avoidant needs a lot of independence. If the two can recognise this and work on it, communicating thoughtfully and taking in each others needs, they can work towards a more healthy, long lasting and secure relationship. This does take time and energy, but if this is you, all is not lost.

The 5 conditions for secure attachment

Attachment styles and the roles they play in relationships is a wide spread topic of interest, both in research and in peoples’ personal drives to understand their patterns of thoughts and behaviors. This level of interest is entirely understandable as the different attachment styles in relationships can impact interpersonal interactions in unique ways.

Attachment types develop early in life and often remain stable over time. However, this does not mean that they cannot be changed into more secure forms of attachment–it just means that you may need to develop self-awareness through understanding and resolving attachment issues. The first step of this process is to learn how insecure attachment develops and influences thoughts and actions within the important relationships in our lives.

Have you wondered why you keep ending up in the same maladaptive relationship situations, even with different partners? Perhaps jealousy and clinginess are frequent behaviors for you, or maybe you’re prone to withdrawing from a relationship once it becomes too emotionally intimate?

If you have noticed a pattern of negative and emotionally challenging behaviors in your love life, you might benefit from digging deep and exploring the way you attach to people in intimate relationships. Understanding what attachment styles are and the basics of attachment theory is an important factor in this process.

According to psychiatrist and psychoanalyst John Bowlby, one’s bond with their primary caregivers during childhood has an overarching influence on their future social and intimate relationships–and even their relationships at work. In other words, this early bond creates a template or rules for how you build and interpret relationships as an adult.



Bowlby’s work on attachment theory dates back to the 1950s and continues to evolve due to the continuous research based on the subject. Based on attachment theory, 4 attachment styles were identified. 

From an evolutionary perspective, cultivating strong relationships and maintaining them has both survival and reproductive advantages. For this reason, Bowlby’s work focused on the human desire to seek contact, love, support, and comfort in others–the innate “need to belong” and how it is one of the main driving forces behind individuals’ actions.

Yet, despite our need to belong, love and relationships are rarely as perfect and problem-free as we would like them to be, and many interpersonal problems can be traced back to the issues associated with our types of attachment styles.

Before getting into the defining characteristics of the four attachment styles, it might be useful to understand how attachment types develop in children.

In essence, how a primary caregiver (usually parents) acts towards and meets their child’s needs forms the foundations for how the child perceives and acts within close relationships.

The reason for this is that a child is dependent on their caregivers and seeks comfort, soothing, and support from them. If these caregivers offer a warm and caring environment, and are attuned to the child’s physical and emotional needs–even when these needs are not clearly expressed–the child becomes securely attached.

On the other hand, misattunement on behalf of caregivers towards their child’s physical and emotional needs is likely to lead to insecure attachment. It may be worth noting that caregiver misattunement may not be intentional, but the child still perceives them as not meeting their needs.

Each of the 4 attachment styles has its own typical traits and characteristics. Yet, a person may not necessarily 100% fit into a single category; attachment is a spectrum and you may not match “the profile” of a specific style exactly.

However, the aim of self-awareness is to identify unhealthy behaviors and understand what you might need to work on in order to improve your love life–which understanding traits of each attachment type and how they develop can facilitate.

Adults with an anxious attachment style tend to have a negative self-view, but a positive view of others. This means that they may view their partner as their literal “better half.” Because someone with this attachment style deems themselves to be less worthy of love in comparison to other people, the thought of living without their partner (or being alone in general) causes high levels of anxiety. In other words, they deeply fear abandonment.

To ease this fear of abandonment, people with the anxious attachment style strongly desire security within relationships, and attention, care, and responsiveness from a partner tends to be the “remedy” for their feelings of anxiety.

On the other hand, the perceived absence of support and intimacy can lead someone with the anxious attachment style to become more clinging and demanding, preoccupied with the relationship, and desperate for reassurance that they are loved.

In a nutshell, people with this attachment style value their relationships highly, but are often hypervigilant towards threats to their security, as well as anxious and worried that their loved one is not as invested in the relationship as they are.

People with the avoidant/dismissive attachment style tend to have a positive self-view and negative one of others. Consequently, they prefer to foster a high sense of independence and self-sufficiency–especially on an emotional level.

Someone with the avoidant attachment style tends to believe that they don’t have to be in a relationship to feel complete: They do not want to depend on others, have others depend on them, or seek support and approval in social bonds.

Adults with this attachment style generally avoid intimacy or emotional closeness, so may withdraw from a relationship if they feel like the other person is becoming reliant on them in this manner. They also tend to hide or suppress their feelings when faced with a potentially emotion-dense situation, such as conflict.

Want to know more about avoidant attachment? Explore this attachment style by topic:

People with the disorganized attachment style tend to vacillate between the traits of both anxious and avoidant attachment depending on their mood and circumstances. For this reason, someone with this attachment style tends to show confusing and ambiguous behaviors in their social bonds.

For adults with disorganized attachment, the partner and the relationship themselves are often the source of both desire and fear. On the one hand, fearful-avoidant people do want intimacy and closeness, but on the other hand, experience troubles trusting and depending on others.

People with this attachment style often struggle with identifying and regulating their emotions and tend to avoid strong emotional attachment due to their intense fear of getting hurt.

Want to know more about disorganized attachment? Explore this attachment style by topic:

The three attachment styles covered so far (anxious, avoidant, and disorganized) are insecure attachment styles, so they are characterized by difficulties with cultivating and maintaining healthy relationships.

In contrast, the secure attachment style implies that a person is comfortable expressing emotions openly. Therefore, adults with a secure attachment style can depend on their partners and, in turn, let their partners rely on them.

Relationships with someone with a secure attachment style are based on honesty, tolerance, and emotional closeness. Although someone with this attachment style often thrives in their relationships, they also don’t fear being on their own. Secure attachers tend to have a positive view of themselves and others, so they do not overly seek external approval or validation–they can successfully identify and regulate their emotions, and even help a partner do so with theirs.

Now that you are acquainted with the four adult attachment styles, you probably have an idea of which one your actions and beliefs lean towards.

Although it is completely normal to recognize features of one or more types of attachment in your history of romantic relationships, it’s important to remember that attachment types can change with major life events, or even with different partners.

For example, an insecurely attached individual could form a secure bond when they have a securely attached partner. On the other hand, it’s also possible for someone with a secure attachment style to develop unhealthy relationship behaviors after experiencing trauma or losing a loved one. So, many people do not “fit” completely into one specific profile.



Chances are that many of us don’t fully identify with the traits of secure attachment. Even if we think we have stable relationships, there might be patterns in our behavior that keep bothering us or making us stressed or unhappy. Unfortunately, some of us will recognize ourselves in the traits of one of the three insecure attachment types. 

If you identify with one of the insecure attachment styles in relationships, it is highly recommended that you actively address the issue through increasing self-awareness, working on self-development, and if necessary, seeking psychological help. If left unaddressed, strongly expressed insecure and unstable attachment types can cause anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.

Here’s the thing: Struggling is simply not necessary, as there are many ways to heal and recover from attachment disturbances.

Ready to learn how to tolerate emotional intimacy and start trusting and relying on people?

Working with a therapist on patterns of insecure behaviors would potentially be the most beneficial way to earn secure attachment. However, many people are not able to avail of one-to-one services due to financial, time, or personal constraints. For this reason, we developed Attachment Styles Workbooks and an Emotions & Self Growth Guide to help you overcome attachment insecurity.

Attachment security doesn’t have to be a distant dream or unachieveable wish: You can achieve a secure attachment style through psychoeducation, self-awareness, and self-growth. We at The Attachment Project are here to support you on this journey.

If you prefer to go the route of a workbook, we recently released our first series of attachment style digital workbooks.

If you’d like to use attachment theory to build better and more secure relationships with everyone around you, our workbooks are the perfect place to start!

Attachment styles refer to patterns of bonding that people learn as children and carry into their adult relationships. They’re typically thought to originate from the type of care one received in their earliest years.

The concept involves one’s confidence in the attachment figure’s availability as a secure base from which one can freely explore the world when not in distress and a safe haven from which one can seek support, protection, and comfort in times of distress.

What are the attachment styles?

In humans, the behavioral attachment system does not conclude in infancy or even childhood. Instead, it is active throughout the lifespan, with individuals gaining comfort from physical and mental representations of significant others (Bowlby, 1969).

There appears to be a continuity between early attachment styles and the quality of later adult romantic relationships.

This idea is based on the internal working model, where an infant’s primary attachment forms a model (template) for future relationships.

Attachment styles are expectations people develop about relationships with others, and the first attachment is based on the relationship individuals had with their primary caregiver when they were infants.

Attachment styles describe people’s comfort and confidence in close relationships, fear of rejection and yearning for intimacy, and preference for self-sufficiency or interpersonal distance.

Attachment styles comprise cognitions relating to both the self (‘Am I worthy of love’) and others (‘Can I depend on others during times of stress’).

Adult attachment styles derived from past relationship histories are conceptualized as internal working models.

Here, individuals can hold either a positive or negative belief of self and a positive or negative belief of others, thus resulting in one of four possible adult attachment styles.

The model of others can also be conceptualized as the avoidant dimension of attachment, which corresponds to the level of discomfort a person feels regarding psychological intimacy and dependency.

Alternatively, the model of self can be conceptualized as the anxiety dimension of attachment, relating to beliefs about self-worth and whether or not one will be accepted or rejected by others (Collins & Allard, 2001).

Bartholomew and Horowitz proposed four adult attachment styles regarding working models of self and others, including secure, dismissive, preoccupied, and fearful.



Securely attached adults tend to hold positive self-images and positive images of others, meaning that they have both a sense of worthiness and an expectation that other people are generally accepting and responsive.

Secure attachment occurs because the mother meets the emotional needs of the infant.

Children with a secure attachment use their mother as a safe base to explore their environment. They are moderately distressed when their mother leaves the room (separation anxiety) and seek contact with their mother when she returns.

They also show moderate stranger anxiety; they show some distress when approached by a stranger.

Adults who demonstrate a secure attachment style value relationships and affirm the impact of relationships on their personalities.

They display a readiness to recall and discuss attachments that suggest much reflection regarding previous relationships.

Secure adults display openness regarding expressing emotions and thoughts with others and are comfortable with depending on others for help while also being comfortable with others depending on them (Cassidy, 1994).

Notably, many secure adults may, in fact, experience negative attachment-related events, yet they can objectively assess people and events and assign a positive value to relationships in general.

Secure lovers characterized their most important romantic relationships as happy and trusting. They can support their partners despite the partners’ faults.

Their relationships also tend to last longer. Secure lovers believe that although romantic feelings may wax and wane, romantic love will never fade.

Through the statistical analysis, secure lovers were found to have had warmer relationships with their parents during childhood.

Individuals with a preoccupied attachment (called anxious when referring to children) hold a negative self-image and a positive image of others, meaning that they have a sense of unworthiness but generally evaluate others positively.

As such, they strive for self-acceptance by attempting to gain approval and validation from their relationships with significant others. They also require higher levels of contact and intimacy in relationships with others.

Children with this type of attachment are clingy to their mother in a new situation and are not willing to explore – suggesting that they do not have trust in her.

They are extremely distressed when separated from their mother. When the mother returns, they are pleased to see her and go to her for comfort, but they cannot be comforted and may show signs of anger towards her.

This type of attachment style occurs because the mother sometimes meets the infant’s needs and sometimes ignores their emotional needs, i.e., the mother’s behavior is inconsistent.

Such individuals crave intimacy but remain anxious about whether other romantic partners will meet their emotional needs. Autonomy and independence can make them feel anxious.

Additionally, they are preoccupied with dependency on their own parents and still actively struggle to please them.

In addition, they can become distressed should they interpret recognition and value from others as being insincere or failing to meet an appropriate level of responsiveness.

Their attachment system is prone to hyperactivation during times of stress, emotions can become amplified, and overdependence on others is increased (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003).

Preoccupied lovers characterize their most important romantic relationships by obsession, desire for reciprocation and union, emotional highs and lows, and extreme sexual attraction and jealousy.

Preoccupied lovers often believe that it is easy for them to fall in love, yet they also claim that unfading love is difficult to find.

Compared with secure lovers, preoccupied lovers report colder relationships with their parents during childhood.

Anxious attachment is also known as insecure resistant or anxious ambivalent.

Dismissive attachment style is demonstrated by adults with a positive self-image and a negative image of others. Their internal working model is based on an avoidant attachment established during infancy.

Children with an avoidant attachment do not use the mother as a safe base; they are not distressed on separation from their caregiver and are not joyful when the mother returns. They show little stranger anxiety.

This type of attachment occurs because the mother ignores the emotional needs of the infant.

They prefer to avoid close relationships and intimacy with others to maintain a sense of independence and invulnerability. This means they struggle with intimacy and value autonomy and self-reliance (Cassidy, 1994).

Dismissive-avoidant adults deny experiencing distress associated with relationships and downplay the importance of attachment in general, viewing other people as untrustworthy.

According to Dr. Julie Smith, a clinical psychologist, these are the signs of an avoidant attachment style in adult relationships:

Dismissive lovers are characterized by fear of intimacy, emotional highs and lows, and jealousy. They are often unsure of their feelings toward their romantic partner, believing that romantic love can rarely last and that it is hard for them to fall in love (Hazan & Shaver, 1987).

Proximity seeking is appraised as unlikely to alleviate distress resulting in deliberate deactivation of the attachment system, inhibition of the quest for support, and commitment to handling distress alone, especially distress arising from the failure of the attachment figure to be available and responsive (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2003).

Dismissive individuals have learned to suppress their emotions at the behavioral level, although they still experience emotional arousal internally (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2005).

This has negative outcomes in terms of cutting themselves off strong feelings, whether their own or others, thus influencing their experiences of romantic relationships.

Adults with a fearful-avoidant attachment style (also referred to as disorganized) hold a negative model of self and also a negative model of others, fearing both intimacy and autonomy.

They display attachment behaviors typical of avoidant children, becoming socially withdrawn and untrusting of others.

The behavior of a fearful-avoidant child is very disorganized, hence why it is also known as disorganized attachment.

If the child and caregiver were to be separated for any amount of time, on the reunion, the child would act conflicted. They may initially run towards their caregiver but then seem to change their mind and either run away or act out.

In the eyes of a child with a fearful avoidant attachment, their caregivers are untrustworthy.

Children with a fearful avoidant attachment are at risk of carrying these behaviors into adulthood if they do not receive support to overcome this. They may struggle to feel secure in any relationship if they do not get help for their attachment style.

“Like dismissing avoidant, they often cope with distancing themselves from relationship partners, but unlike dismissing individuals, they continue to experience anxiety and neediness concerning their partner’s love, reliability, and trustworthiness” (Schachner, Shaver & Mikulincer, 2003, p. 248).

A fearful avoidant prefers casual relationships and may stay in the dating stage of the relationship for a prolonged period as this feels more comfortable for them.

This is not always because they want to, but because they fear getting closer to someone.

A study found that those with a fearful avoidant attachment style are likely to have more sexual partners and higher sexual compliance than other attachment styles (Favez & Tissot, 2019).

They may prefer to have more sexual partners as a way to get physically close to someone without having to also be emotionally vulnerable to them – thus meeting their need for closeness.

They could also be more sexually compliant due to having poorer boundaries and learning in childhood that their boundaries do not matter. It is important to remember that this is not the case for all fearful avoidants.

A partner with this attachment style may prefer to keep their partner at a distance so that things do not get too emotionally intense.

They may be reluctant to share too much of themselves to protect themselves from eventual hurt. If the relationship gets too deep or they are asked to share personal stories, the fearful-avoidant may shut down rapidly.

It is common for those with a fearful attachment style to have grown up in a household that is very chaotic and toxic. As such, the fearful-avoidant may expect that their romantic relationships as adults should also be chaotic.

If they are in a relationship with someone secure and calm, they may be suspicious of why this is. They may believe something must be wrong and may challenge their partner or create a problem to make the relationship more unsettled but familiar to them.

They tend to always expect something bad to happen in their relationship and will likely find any reason to damage the relationship so they do not get hurt.

They may blame or accuse their partner of things they have not done, threaten to leave the relationship, or test their partner to see if this makes them jealous. All these strategies may cause their partner to consider ending the relationship.

According to  John Bowlby (1969), later relationships are likely to be a continuation of early attachment styles (secure and insecure) because the behavior of the infant’s primary attachment figure promotes an internal working model of relationships, which leads the infant to expect the same in later relationships.

In other words, there will be continuity between early attachment experiences and later relationships. This is known as the continuity hypothesis.

According to the continuity hypothesis, experiences with childhood attachment figures are retained over time and used to guide perceptions of the social world and future interactions with others.

The attachment styles we develop as children through interactions with primary caregivers often persist into adulthood and influence our expectations, emotions, and behaviors in romantic relationships. Specifically, secure, anxious, and avoidant attachment styles tend to be continuous from infancy into adulthood romantic attachments.

Attachment theory, developed by Bowlby to explain emotional bonding between infants and caregivers, has implications for understanding romantic relationships.

There appears to be a continuity between early attachment styles and the quality of later adult romantic relationships. This idea is based on the internal working model, where an infant’s primary attachment forms a model (template) for future relationships.

The internal working model influences a person’s expectation of later relationships thus affects his attitudes towards them. In other words there will be continuity between early attachment experiences and later relationships.

Adult relationships are likely to reflect early attachment style because the experience a person has with their caregiver in childhood would lead to the expectation of the same experiences in later relationships.

This is illustrated in Hazan and Shaver’s love quiz experiment. They conducted a study to collect information on participants’ early attachment styles and attitudes toward loving relationships. They found that those securely attached as infants tended to have happy, lasting relationships.

On the other hand, insecurely attached people found adult relationships more difficult, tended to divorce, and believed love was rare. This supports the idea that childhood experiences have a significant impact on people’s attitudes toward later relationships.

The continuity hypothesis is accused of being reductionist because it assumes that people who are insecurely attached as infants would have poor-quality adult relationships. This is not always the case. Researchers found plenty of people having happy relationships despite having insecure attachments. Therefore, the theory might be an oversimplification.

Brennan and Shaver (1995) discovered that there was a strong association between one’s own attachment type and the romantic partner’s attachment type, suggesting that attachment style could impact one’s choice of partners.

To be more specific, the study found that a secure adult was most likely to be paired with another secure adult, while it was least likely for an avoidant adult to be paired with a secure adult; when a secure adult did not pair with a secure partner, he or she was more likely to have an anxious-preoccupied partner instead.

Moreover, whenever an avoidant or anxious adult did not pair with a secure partner, he or she was more likely to end up with an avoidant partner; an anxious adult was unlikely to be paired with another Anxious adult.

Adult attachment style also impacts how one behaves in romantic relationships (jealousy, trust, proximity-seeking, etc.) and how long these relationships can last, as discussed in earlier paragraphs about Hazan and Shaver’s (1987) findings.

These are, in turn, related to overall relationship satisfaction. Brennan and Shaver (1995) found that inclining toward a secure attachment type was positively correlated with one’s relationship satisfaction, whereas being either more avoidant or anxious was negatively associated with one’s relationship satisfaction.

Regarding attachment-related behaviors within relationships, being inclined to seek proximity and trust others was positively correlated with one’s relationship satisfaction.

Being self-reliant, ambivalent, jealous, clingy, easily frustrated towards one’s partner, or insecure is generally negatively correlated with one’s relationship satisfaction.

The attachment style and related behaviors of one’s partners were also found to impact one’s relationship satisfaction. Not surprisingly, having a Secure partner increases one’s relationship satisfaction.

However, an avoidant partner was the only type of partner that seemed to contribute negatively towards one’s relationship satisfaction, while an Anxious partner had no significant impact in this aspect.

The partner’s inclination to seek proximity and trust others increased one’s satisfaction, while one’s partner’s ambivalence and frustration towards oneself decreased one’s satisfaction.

There is evidence that attachment styles may be transmitted between generations.

Research indicates an intergenerational continuity between adult attachment types and their children, including children adopting the parenting styles of their parents. People tend to base their parenting style on the internal working model, so the attachment type tends to be passed on through generations of a family.

Main, Kaplan, and Cassidy (1985) found a strong association between the security of the adults’ working model of attachment and that of their infants’, with a particularly strong correlation between mothers and infants (vs. fathers and infants).

Additionally, the same study also found that dismissive adults were often parents to avoidant infants. In contrast, preoccupied adults were often parents to resistant/ambivalent infants, suggesting that how adults conceptualized attachment relationships had a direct impact on how their infants attached to them.

An alternative explanation for continuity in relationships is the temperament hypothesis which argues that an infant’s temperament affects how a parent responds and so may be a determining factor in infant attachment type. The infant’s temperament may explain their issues (good or bad) with relationships in later life.

A new study published in the British Journal of Clinical Psychology sheds light on how our attachment styles affect our mental health and behaviors during difficult times like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Using advanced statistical techniques, researchers found that people with insecure attachment styles (especially anxious and fearful-avoidant attachments) suffered more depression, anxiety, and loneliness than their securely attached peers.

The researchers surveyed over 1300 UK adults at two time points between April and August 2020 to understand connections between attachment styles, adherence to social distancing guidelines, and mental health. They used cutting-edge causal modeling methods to estimate the likely causal effects.

The results showed that anxious and fearful-avoidant participants had around 5-6% higher depression and anxiety, and were 17-18% lonelier than secure individuals.

Over time, they maintained these elevated mental health symptoms while secure participants’ levels decreased. Greater loneliness explains the poorer mental health of insecure groups.

Avoidant participants were less likely to follow social distancing rules than secure individuals, although the effect size was small. Attachment style did not predict mental health changes from timepoints 1 to 2.

Our attachment style is a risk factor for worse mental health crises during difficult collective experiences like lockdowns. Insecure individuals are more prone to loneliness driving their anxiety and depression.

The study highlights the need for targeted interventions to alleviate loneliness and promote security.

A limitation is the use of categorical attachment measures, but the advanced statistics provide compelling evidence attachment causally influences our mental health and behaviors during COVID-19.

Researchers have proposed that working models are interconnected within a complex hierarchical structure (Collins & Read, 1994).

For example, the highest-level model comprises beliefs and expectations across all types of relationships, and lower-level models hold general rules about specific relations, such as romantic or parental, underpinned by models specific to events within a relationship with a single person.

Ainsworth proposed the ‘sensitivity hypothesis,’ which states that the more responsive the mother is to the infant during their early months, the more secure their attachment will be.

To test this, she designed the ‘Strange Situation’ to observe attachment security in children within the context of caregiver relationships.

The child and mother experience a range of scenarios in an unfamiliar room. The procedure involves a series of eight episodes lasting approximately 3 minutes each, whereby a mother, child, and stranger are introduced, separated, and reunited.

Mary Ainsworth classified infants into one of three attachment styles; insecure avoidant (‘A’), secure (‘B’), or insecure ambivalent (‘C’).

A fourth attachment style, disorganized, was later identified (Main & Solomon, 1990).

Each type of attachment style comprises a set of attachment behavioral strategies used to achieve proximity with the caregiver and a feeling of security.

From an evolutionary perspective, an infant’s attachment classification (A, B, or C) is an adaptive response to the characteristics of the caregiving environment.

Ainsworth’s maternal sensitivity hypothesis argues that a child’s attachment style depends on their mother’s behavior towards them.

Mary Main and her colleagues developed the Adult Attachment Interview that asked for descriptions of early attachment-related events and for the adults’ sense of how these relationships and events had affected adult personalities (George, Kaplan, & Main, 1984).

It is noteworthy that the Adult Attachment Interview assessed “the security of the self in relation to attachment in its generality rather than in relation to any particular present or past relationship” (Main, Kaplan, & Cassidy, 1985).

For example, the general state of mind regarding attachment rather than how one is attached to another specific individual.

Main, Kaplan, and Cassidy (1985) analyzed adults’ responses to the Adult Attachment Interview and observed three major patterns in the way adults recounted and interpreted childhood attachment experiences and relationships in general:

In the world of attachment studies, a big question is whether our ideas about relationships are kind of like a one-size-fits-all thing, working the same way across all relationships, or if they’re specific to particular relationships.  Some experts, like Kobak (1994), have explored this.

So, one way to look at it is as an “individual difference.” This means that our attachment styles, our inner guides for how we connect with people, stay pretty much the same over time.

These styles are based on our experiences with people we’re close to, like parents, friends, and romantic partners. Bartholomew and Horowitz (1991) think that how we act in relationships tends to be consistent, no matter who we’re with.

On the flip side, some folks believe that our attachment styles can change depending on the type of relationship. So, instead of one all-encompassing inner model for relationships, we might have different models for different types of connections. This means that you could be feeling secure with your parents but insecure in your romantic relationships.

A study with young adults showed that people have different attachment styles for various types of relationships, like with parents, friends, and romantic partners (Caron et al., 2012).

Researchers have suggested that these inner models are like a set of Russian dolls, with a big one that covers all types of relationships and smaller ones for specific types, like romance or family. These smaller ones are built on even smaller models, like beliefs about things that happen within one relationship.

There’s evidence supporting the idea that we have multiple internal working models because people can have a lot of different thoughts and feelings about themselves and others. And, while these specific relationship models are related to our overall generalized inner models, the connection isn’t super strong.

It means that our beliefs about ourselves and our partners in one type of relationship are somewhat separate from our broader views (Cozzarelli, Hoekstra, & Bylsma, 2000).

So, in a nutshell, our general ideas about relationships cover a wide range, while our specific thoughts about certain relationships are just a piece of the bigger picture.

Additionally, it is also noteworthy that one’s attachment style may alter over time as well.

Another interesting thing is that your attachment style can change over time. In different studies, about 70% of people had relatively stable attachment styles, while the other 30% were more flexible.

Baldwin and Fehr (1995) discovered that 30% of adults changed their attachment styles fairly quickly, sometimes in as little as a week or a few months. People who initially identified as anxious-ambivalent were the most likely to change.

In a 20-year  longitudinal study, Waters et al. (2000) conducted the Adult Attachment Interview with young adults who had participated in the Strange Situation experiment 20 years ago. They found that 72% of the participants received the same secure vs. insecure attachment classifications as they did during infancy.

The remaining participants did change in terms of attachment patterns, with the majority – though not all – of them having experienced major negative life events.

Such findings suggest that attachment style assessments should be interpreted more prudently; furthermore, there is always the possibility for change – and it need not be related to negative events, either.

Bowlby’s (1969) theory holds that internal working models can become more resistant to change over time in a stable environment, but change is still possible over development. Attachment security and insecurity can be seen as diverging pathways – the further one progresses down one path, the harder it is to switch to the other.

# Attachment Styles and How they Affect Your Relationships

Get a single membership for just $6.67 per month

If you’ve ever putzed around the internet, looking for why your relationships might all be screwed up (and screwed up in the same ways, I might add), then you’ve probably come across Attachment Theory.

Attachment Theory is an area of psychology that describes the nature of emotional attachment between humans. It begins as children with our attachment to our parents. The nature of this attachment, and how well it’s fostered and cared for, will then influence the nature of our attachment to romantic partners later in our life.1

Attachment theory began in the 1950s and has since amassed a small mountain of research behind it. Two researchers, John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth, found that the nature in which infants get their needs met by their parents significantly contributes to their “attachment strategy” throughout their lives.2

Your attachment style doesn’t explain everything about your relationships, but it probably explains a great deal of why your close relationships have succeeded/failed in the manner they did, why you’re attracted to the people you are attracted to, and the nature of the relationship problems that come up again and again for you.

According to psychologists, there are four attachment strategies adults can adopt: secure, anxious, avoidant, and anxious-avoidant.3

People with secure attachment strategies are comfortable displaying interest and affection. They are also comfortable being alone and independent, and display a healthy level of self-confidence. They’re able to correctly prioritize their relationships within their life and tend to draw clear boundaries and stick to them.

Secure attachment types obviously make the best romantic partners, family members, and even friends. They’re capable of accepting rejection and moving on despite the pain, but are also capable of being loyal and sacrificing when necessary. They have little issue trusting people they’re close to and are trustworthy themselves.

Secure types comfortably form intimate relationships not only with partners, but also with friends. They have no trouble revealing themselves to and occasionally relying on others when the situation calls for it. And they are excellent caregivers.4

According to research, over 50% of the population are secure attachment types.5



Anxious attachment types are often nervous and stressed about their relationships. They need constant reassurance and affection from their partner. They have trouble being alone or single. They’ll often succumb to unhealthy or abusive relationships.

Anxious types have trouble trusting people, even if they’re close to them, yet excessively rely on others for their emotional needs and to resolve their problems. Their behavior can be irrational, sporadic, and overly-emotional. They’re the ones complaining that everyone of the opposite sex are cold and heartless. And probably bursting into tears while doing so.

This is the girl who calls you 36 times in one night wondering why you didn’t call her back—let’s call her Anna. Or the guy who follows his girlfriend to work to make sure she’s not flirting with any other men.

Women are more likely to be anxious types than men,6 but it’s okay, there’s still plenty of insecurity to go around.

Avoidant attachment types are extremely independent, self-directed, and often uncomfortable with intimacy. They’re commitment-phobes and experts at rationalizing their way out of any intimate situation. They regularly complain about feeling “crowded” or “suffocated” when people try to get close to them. They are often paranoid that others want to control them or box them in.



In every relationship, they always have an exit strategy. Always. Avoidants often construct their lifestyle in such a way to avoid commitment or too much intimate contact.

In surveys, avoidant types score uniquely high on self-confidence and uniquely low on emotional expressiveness and warmth. They not only reveal themselves far less to their partner and friends, but also tend not to rely on others, even when they should. They score lower than other types as caregivers, meaning they’re not to be relied upon when in a pickle.7

It’s a sad fact that relationships tend to be controlled by those who care least. Therefore, avoidants tend to be the ones in control in both friendships and romantic relationships, as they are almost always willing to leave. This is opposed to anxious types, who let themselves be controlled in both.8

This is the guy—we’ll call him Alex—who works 80 hours a week and gets annoyed when women he dates want to see him more than once on the weekend. Or the girl who dates dozens of guys over the course of years but tells them all she doesn’t want “anything serious” and inevitably ends up ditching them when she gets tired of them.

Men are more likely than women to be avoidant types,9 but as always, there’s plenty of neuroses to go around.

Anxious-avoidant attachment types (also known as the “fearful or disorganized type”) bring together the worst of both worlds. Anxious-avoidants are not only afraid of intimacy and commitment, but they distrust and lash out emotionally at anyone who tries to get close to them. Anxious-avoidants often spend much of their time alone and miserable, or in abusive or dysfunctional relationships.

Anxious-avoidants are low in confidence and less likely to express emotions, preferring to suppress them.10 However, they can have intense emotional outbursts when under stress.11 They also don’t tend to seek help when in need due to a distrust of others. This sucks because they are also incapable of sorting through their own issues.12

Anxious-avoidants really get the worst of both worlds. They avoid intimacy not because they prefer to be alone like avoidants. Rather, they avoid intimacy because they are so terrified of its potential to hurt them.13

According to studies, only a small percentage of the population qualifies as anxious-avoidant types, and they typically have a multitude of other emotional problems in other areas of their life (i.e., substance abuse, depression, etc.14).

As with most psychological profiling, these types aren’t monolithic qualities, but scalar in nature and somewhat independent.

For instance, according to the book Attached by Amir Levie and Rachel Heller, I scored about 75% on the secure scale, 90% on the avoidant scale, and 10% on the anxious scale. And my guess is that 3-5 years ago, the secure would have been lower and the anxious would have been higher, although my avoidant has always been solidly maxed out (as any of my ex-girlfriends will tell you).

The point is, you can exhibit tendencies of more than one strategy depending on the situation and at different frequencies. Although, everyone has one dominant strategy. So Secure Sarah will still exhibit some avoidant or anxious behaviors, Anxious Anna and Avoidant Alex will sometimes exhibit secure behaviors, etc. It’s not all or nothing. But Anxious-avoidant Aaron will score high on both anxious and avoidant types and low on the secure scale.

Like I said previously, our attachment styles as adults are influenced by how we related to our parents (or one parent/primary caregiver) as young children. As helpless little babies, this is our first and most important relationship of our lives, so it naturally sets the “blueprint” for how we perceive all relationships as we mature.15

We use this relationship blueprint as we age into late childhood and adolescence, when we typically start to form important relationships outside of our immediate relationship with our parent(s). Our peer group takes on a larger role in our lives as we continue to learn how to relate to others. These experiences further influence our attachment style as we eventually become romantically involved with others, which, in turn, also influence our attachment style.16

So while your early experiences with your parent(s) do have a considerable influence on how you relate to others, it’s not the only factor that determines your attachment style (though it’s a big one) and your attachment style can change over time (more on this later).

Generally, though, secure attachment types regularly have their needs met as infants. They grew up feeling competent among their peers, but were also comfortable with their shortcomings to a degree. As a result, they exhibit healthy, strong boundaries as adults, can communicate their needs well in their relationships, and aren’t afraid to leave a bad one if they think they need to.

Anxious types, on the other hand, receive love and care with unpredictable sufficiency as infants. Growing up, they have positive views of their peers, but negative views of themselves. Their romantic relationships are often overly idealized and they rely too heavily on them for self-esteem. Hence the 36 calls in one night when you don’t pick up your phone.

Avoidants like Alex would have got only some of their needs met as infants, while the rest were neglected (for instance, Alex might have gotten fed regularly, but wasn’t held enough). So Alex grows up holding a negative view of others but a positive view of himself. He hasn’t depended too much on his romantic relationships for his needs and feels like he doesn’t need others for emotional support.

Anxious-avoidant Aaron, though, would have had an abusive or terribly negligent childhood. He grew up having a hard time relating to his peers. So as an adult, he seeks both intimacy and independence in romantic interactions, sometimes simultaneously, which, as you can imagine, doesn’t really go well.

Different attachment types tend to configure themselves into intimate relationships in predictable ways. Secure types are capable of dating (or handling, depending on your perspective) both anxious and avoidant types. They’re comfortable enough with themselves to give anxious types all of the reassurance they need and to give avoidant types the space they need without feeling threatened themselves.

Anxious and avoidants frequently end up in relationships with one another more often than they end up in relationships with their own types.17 That may seem counter-intuitive, but there’s order behind the madness. Avoidant types are so good at putting others off that oftentimes it’s only the anxious types who are willing to stick around and put in the extra effort to get them to open up.

For instance, Avoidant Alex may be able to successfully shirk Secure Sarah’s pushes for increased intimacy. After which, Secure Sarah will accept the rejection and move on. But Anxious Anna will only become more determined by a man who pushes her away. She’ll resort to calling him for weeks or months on end until he finally caves and commits to her. This gives Avoidant Alex the reassurance he needs that he can behave independently and Anxious Anna will wait around for him.

Often these relationships produce some degree of dysfunctional equilibrium as they fall into a pattern of chaser-chasee, which are both roles the anxious and avoidant types need in order to feel comfortable with intimacy.



Anxious-avoidants only date each other or the least secure of the anxious types or avoidant types. These relationships are very messy, if not downright abusive or negligent.

What all of this adds up to, which is the same conclusion I propose in my book, is that in relationships, insecurity finds insecurity and security finds security, even if those insecurities don’t always look the same.18 To put it bluntly, to everyone who has emailed me over the years complaining that all of the people they meet are insecure, or have trust issues, or are needy and manipulative… well, let’s just say I have some bad news for you.

If you don’t have an idea of what your attachment style is yet and want to take a test, you can take this one. It’s a great resource that will give you an idea of your attachment style across different relationships—parents, friends, romantic partners.

I also really like it because you can track how various aspects of your attachment strategy change over time.

If you don’t want to take the test (takes maybe 10 minutes), the gist of it is this: if you’re consistently avoiding commitment, avoiding your romantic partners, shutting them out, or not sharing things with them, then you’re probably pretty avoidant.

If you’re constantly worrying about your partners, feel like they don’t like you as much as you like them, want to see them 24/7, need constant reassurance from them, then you’re probably anxious.

If you’re comfortable dating people, being intimate with them and are able to draw clear boundaries in your relationships, but also don’t mind being alone, then you’re probably secure.

Note, however, that there are some individual differences in how strongly we might identify with each attachment style. For example, you might be securely attached in most areas but have some anxious or avoidant tendencies in other situations.

That said, most people typically have a predominant attachment style they tend to fall back on in their close relationships.

The good news is that your attachment style can change over time—although it’s slow and difficult.

Research shows that an anxious or avoidant who enters a long-term relationship with a secure can be “raised up” to the level of the secure over an extended period of time. Unfortunately, an anxious or avoidant is also capable of “bringing down” a secure to their level of insecurity if they’re not careful.19

Also, extreme negative life events, such as divorce, death of child, serious accident, etc., can cause a secure attachment type to fall into a more insecure attachment type.20

For instance, anonymous man may be more or less secure, get married to Anxious Anna, bring her up to a more secure level, but when they run into money trouble she falls back to her anxious level, cheats on him and then divorces him for all of his money, sending him into a tailspin of avoidance. Anonymous goes on to ignore intimacy and pump-and-dump women for the next 10 years, afraid to become intimate with any of them.

If you’re beginning to think that anxious and/or avoidant behavior corresponds to the fake alpha syndrome and other insecure behavior I describe in men in my book, then you’re correct. Our attachment styles are intimately connected with our confidence in ourselves and others.

Psychologists Bartholomew and Horowitz have hypothesized a model showing that one’s attachment strategy corresponds to the degree of positive/negative self-image, and the positive/negative image of others.21



Secures exhibit both positive self-images and positive perceptions of others. Anxious types exhibit negative self-images, but positive perceptions of others (hence their needy behavior).

Avoidants exhibit positive self-images and negative perceptions of others (hence their arrogance and fear of commitment), and anxious-avoidants exhibit negative perceptions of just about everything and everyone (hence their inability to function in relationships).

Using this model as a roadmap, one can begin to navigate oneself to a more secure attachment type.

Anxious types can work on developing themselves, creating healthy boundaries and fostering a healthy self-image. Instead of constantly looking for “the one” who will magically solve all their problems (and then calling them 36 times in one night), they can look for things that will make them a better, healthier person both in body and mind.

One of my most common pieces of dating advice is for men to find something they’re passionate about and good at and make that a focal point of their life rather than women. Needless to say, the same goes for women as well.

Once they’re content with who they are, anxious types can then work to become more aware of their tendency to seek partners that reaffirm their negative self-image.22

Remember what I said about insecurity finding insecurity? Anxious types will do well to break out of that cycle and surround themselves with people, friends and lovers alike, who lift them up, rather than knock them down. And to deepen those relationships. The positive emotional experiences they get from healthy relationships, especially profound ones like with a spouse, will re-shape their view of the world, reduce their anxieties, and help mold them into more secure types.23

Avoidant types can work on opening themselves up to others, and enrich their relationships through sharing themselves more. Research shows that simply not avoiding relationships can help avoidants move away from their avoidant tendency.24 And similar to anxious types, avoidants should stop seeking to reaffirm their view of the world with every single person they meet—not everyone is untrustworthy or clingy.

Another one of my most common pieces of advice to people is that it’s your responsibility to find something great in everyone you meet. It’s not their responsibility to show you. Become curious. Stop being judgmental.

For the unlucky few who find themselves both anxious and avoidant, they can follow the advice for both types above. Focus on getting to know themselves, their fears and insecurities, embrace them, and learn to work with them, rather than against them. A few simple tools to help them do this are journaling and meditation. Professional therapy can also be effective.25

And of course, some of you may be reading this and thinking, “I like being alone and being able to sleep with whoever I want. I wouldn’t change a thing.” And it’s true—many people lead happy, successful lives as avoidant or anxious types. Some even have successful long-term relationships as an anxious or avoidant.

But research shows secures are consistently more happy and feel more supported,26 are less likely to become depressed,27 are healthier,28 retain more stable relationships, and become more successful29 than the other types.

And I can tell you from my personal experience, I’ve felt myself drift out of a strong avoidant (and slightly anxious) attachment type to a more secure attachment type over the past six years of working on myself in this area. And I can unequivocally say that I’m happier and more fulfilled in my relationships and with the women I date now than I ever was back then.

I wouldn’t trade it back for anything.

# The four attachment styles and how they affect your relationships | CNN


            Do you identify as anxious, avoidant, disorganized or secure?
    


            For those who aren’t up on pop psychology vernacular, these terms refer to the four attachment styles. Attachment styles describe how people behave in relationships, from their desires for closeness and intimacy to their sensitivity to potential relationship threats. But unlike say, the five love languages or the Myers-Briggs personality types, attachment styles are rooted in science.
    


            First developed by psychoanalyst John Bowlby in the 1950s and later expanded on by his colleague Mary Ainsworth, attachment theory originally focused on how infants behaved when they were separated from their caregivers. Then in the ‘80s, psychologists Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver discovered that adults exhibited similar patterns of behavior in romantic relationships.
    


            As people seek to understand themselves and their partners, attachment theory has since transcended the pages of psychology textbooks and achieved mainstream recognition. The 2010 self-help book “Attached: The New Science of Attachment and How It Can Help You Find — And Keep — Love,” written by Dr. Amir Levine and Rachel Heller, has seen a recent surge in sales. On TikTok, meanwhile, the hashtag #attachmentstyle has been viewed more than a billion times.
    


            Understanding your own attachment style, as well as the attachment styles of others in your life, can help improve your relationships. But even though attachment theory is ubiquitous these days, it’s often misunderstood.
    


            People with a secure attachment style are overall comfortable with closeness and intimacy and able to communicate their needs and feelings in relationships, said Levine, who is also an associate professor of psychiatry at Columbia University. Secure people tend to be warm and loving, and generally trust their partners without fearing they will be abandoned. Perhaps unsurprisingly, secure people tend to be happier in relationships, Levine said.
    


            Psychologists Hazan and Shaver found in their research that about 56% of subjects had a secure attachment style.
    


            People with an anxious attachment style crave intimacy and closeness, Levine told CNN. But they’re also sensitive to potential relationship threats — they tend to worry about whether their partner wants to be with them, and therefore require more frequent validation.
    


            When confronting a potential relationship threat, anxiously attached people can sometimes resort to something called protest behavior — for example, if they sense that their partner is being less attentive to them, they might do things to make their partner jealous or threaten to leave. However misguided, such reactions are an attempt to reestablish connection in the relationship.
    


            About 19% of Hazan and Shaver’s research subjects had an anxious-ambivalent (another word for anxious) attachment style.
    


            People with an avoidant attachment style associate intimacy with a loss of independence, and as a result, they tend to withdraw when someone gets too close. It’s not necessarily that these people don’t want to be in relationships, Levine said, but they feel overwhelmed by closeness.
    


            “There’s this idea that love conquers all — that if someone loves you enough, they will do everything in their power to be with you,” Levine said. “But that’s not true at all. People can love you a lot, but depending on their attachment style, they’ll behave very differently.”
    


            About 25% of Hazan and Shaver’s research subjects had an avoidant attachment style.
    


            Fearful avoidant attachment, also known as disorganized, is a combination of anxious and avoidant styles and is rarer and less discussed than the other three. People with fearful avoidant attachment desire connection, but fear getting hurt once they are in a relationship and tend to push people away as a result.
    


            Between 3% to 5% of people fall into this category, Levine and Heller wrote in “Attached.”
    


            “They have tendencies of both anxious and avoidant attachment styles, except there’s more of this core wound of betrayal,” added Jessica Da Silva, a marriage and family therapist and attachment coach. “Oftentimes they’ve had very severe levels of trauma, often a lot of abuse. So there’s this sense of not really being able to fully trust people.”
    


            Research suggests that just knowing about the four attachment styles can have a positive effect on your relationships — and these can apply not just with romantic partners, but also with friends, family and colleagues.
    


            But rather than thinking about attachment styles as rigid categories, Levine said it’s more accurate to think of them as orientations. These characteristics exist on a spectrum, and are generally dependent on context. Some people might have a mild anxious attachment, while others might have a more extreme one. Attachment styles can also vary from relationship to relationship — a person might be secure with their romantic partner, but anxious with their coworkers, for instance.
    


            It can be tempting to view anxious, avoidant and fearful avoidant attachment styles as a sign that something is wrong with you. But that simply isn’t true, nor is it the case that all anxious people are needy and all avoidant people are narcissistic, Levine said. Our attachment styles are part of our biology — there are evolutionary advantages to being more sensitive to threats or to being more independent.
    


            “Attachment styles are not pathological. They’re just a normal variation of a norm,” Levine added.
    


            When it comes to relationships, however, there’s evidence to suggest that it’s more advantageous to being secure. One recent study found that secure adults are more likely to have better mental health outcomes. But if you identify more as avoidant or anxious, not all hope is lost. People have the potential to change their attachment styles and become more secure over time. In addition to recognizing how you respond to threats in relationships, Levine recommends surrounding yourself with more secure people.
    


            Attachment styles aren’t the end all be all of relationships — some psychologists suggest that reading a self-help book about attachment styles be done in conjunction with therapy or other interventional approaches. But they’re one tool that you can use to better understand yourself and the people who you have relationships with.

# What is Anxious Attachment in Relationships? (Traits & Triggers)

What is anxious attachment in relationships? 

Do you feel you do everything you can to impress your partner, only to have them pull away? Maybe you’re struggling with jealousy, worried that no matter how hard you try, you’re never good enough, and/ or feel like you have to walk on eggshells around them. If so, you’re in the right place. 

Today, we’re diving into anxious attachment in relationships by defining what this attachment style is, where it comes from, examples of what it looks like, and better yet – how to overcome anxious attachment.

Ready to have all your relationship questions about anxious attachment answered? Let’s get started.

What is your attachment style?

>>TAKE THE QUIZ<<

 

Anxious attachment is one of the four relationship attachment styles. Being anxious in relationships can start from infancy and follow adults throughout their lives. This idea is proved and explained through the attachment theory. 

The attachment theory consists of four unique attachment styles in relationships. All four styles are blueprints for how you’ve learned to give and receive love and they explain your behaviors in adult romantic relationships. 

The attachment theory reveals that these styles are developed during your childhood and formed from the interactions you have with your primary caregivers. Those early-life relationships shape the romantic ones you’ll have as an adult.

The four attachment styles are classified as:



The first three attachment styles (Anxious, Avoidant, and Disorganized) are insecure styles. The fourth style (Secure) is where many strive to be. According to research, people with secure attachment styles tend to be happiest in relationships.

Let’s take a closer look at anxious attachment and what specifically causes that insecure attachment style.

The consensus in the field is that our experiences, especially those of our childhood, often impact our attachment style. How our parents and primary caregivers show us love (or lack thereof) develops our attachment style. It’s common that parents will even pass down their own attachment styles. 

Therefore, anxious attachment is often developed by an anxious or preoccupied parent. The parent likely experienced this attachment style themselves as a child. Anxious parents may have grown up without their own emotional needs being met, which left them feeling empty. As they grow up and have children, they may cling to their baby to fill this emotional void.

Enter the generational cycle of anxious attachment. For example, an anxious parent may overdo it with their child in an attempt to feel love and reassurance from them. In exchange, the child does not internalize a sense of calm and may be left in a state of confusion about whether they can or cannot depend on others. As they grow up, this carries into their romantic relationships and eventually onto their children, and the cycle continues.

However, there are instances where the opposite happens. You might have a child that is temperamentally desirous of more affection than an avoidant or dismissive parent is willing or capable of providing. So, the child grows up to anxiously search for a new parent in their adult romantic partners in an unconscious attempt to heal their inner child (more on that soon).

Now that you know how we develop our attachment styles, let’s break down anxious attachment specifically.

If you’re walking on eggshells or chasing after an unattainable partner, you may be dealing with anxious attachment. Anxious attachment in adults, or what I refer to as Open-Hearted attachment, describes adults who struggle with feelings of unworthiness.

Anxious attachment is often formed from an underlying fear of abandonment and rejection. Often, it’s shown in relationships as a fear of not being good enough and clingy behavior. 

Curious to learn how to spot an Open Heart with anxious attachment? Here are the traits they may display:



Due to your nature of insecurity, you may believe you don’t deserve love, but instead have to earn love and approval. This makes you drawn to challenging partners that make you work for it. On the other hand, if your partner gives you love and affection too freely, you may find them boring and want to move on.

Now that you know what anxious attachment looks like as an individual, let’s see how this attachment style affects relationships.

What is your attachment style?

>>TAKE THE QUIZ<<

 

Your attachment style directly affects your relationships. Attachment styles are a good indicator of how you deal with emotional intimacy, so those with different styles behave differently in relationships. 

So how does anxious attachment affect relationships? Let’s look at some examples.

Earlier, we discussed some traits of the anxious attached individual. Now let’s look at how it plays out within a relationship. 

In an intimate relationship, many anxious adults will make themselves indispensable to their partners. They think “If they need me, they won’t leave me.” They want to feel needed.

But, this backfires. After all the work you put in, you always question whether or not they really love you for YOU.

Within a relationship, Open Hearts struggle with knowing – or showing – the real version of themselves. Their insecure feelings of unworthiness tend to get them lost in the potential of a relationship, rather than seeing the reality of it.

Anxious attachments often mask their true feelings because they are afraid of showing vulnerability. As a result of not having their needs met or their feelings heard, they cause conflict by acting defensively or in provocative ways.



But, the hardest thing for those with anxious attachment in relationships is that they usually attract other partners with insecure attachment styles. This causes what’s called the anxious-avoidant trap. This is where you typically find yourself dating someone that is emotionally unavailable, thus “proving” your deepest fear: that you are unlovable.

By avoiding the anxious-avoidant trap, you can successfully date someone with anxious attachment. But, how? That’s next.

Clients repeatedly ask me, “How can I date someone with anxious attachment?” My advice is to learn some anxious attachment trigger statements and learn how to respond. 

For anxious Open Hearts, avoid triggering statements like:

Instead, try to reassure Open Hearts with statements like: 

Another common, triggering phrase that Open Hearts hate to hear is “You’re overreacting.” Although this phrase is said as an attempt to defuse a tense situation and reduce anxiety, an Open Heart might perceive it as dismissive and devaluing.

Instead, what an Open Heart needs to hear is: “Even if I can’t understand why you’re feeling this way, I know what it’s like to feel overwhelmed. How can I support you?” You and your partner can move forward from this conflict by finding common ground that each of you has felt overwhelmed in life.



When you can learn to reduce the anxiety of your partner and understand that many of their actions come from a place of love, you’ll find greater success – no matter what attachment style they are. For someone with an anxious attachment style, just remember to be there for them. 

Inevitably, your anxious attachment will be triggered. Before you take the blame and get down on yourself, try to take a moment to overcome the trigger. Here are some tips on how to handle being triggered.

The first thing to do is always breathe. Reground yourself in the present moment and pause to notice how you feel within your body. What sensations are there internally? Where do you feel the stress? Just look inward and take a moment to allow yourself to simply feel.

You may feel like you’re being flooded and overwhelmed by your feelings. Rather than reacting and allowing your emotions to boil over, try to leverage body activation. 

What I mean is trying to shift gears in your head and think ahead, instead. This doesn’t mean denying your feelings, but rather switching to positive thoughts. For example, plan your next vacation in your head. Just thinking positively can turn things around quickly.

Another option? Think about being the hero of your own story. You may feel less triggered when you focus on the idea that your happiness is in your control.

Overcoming anxious attachment triggers is possible, but it takes practice. Be gracious and patient with yourself and your partner as you learn these new behaviors. So, let’s talk about overcoming anxious attachment in relationships next. 

Do you want to overcome anxious attachment? You can. With some help, you or your partner can go from “you’re too good for me” to “you make me want to be a better partner.” Let’s discuss actionable steps to help you get started. First, we must address your inner child.

Anxious attachment is developed when we’re children, so healing your inner child is a good place to start. The concept of an inner child is an effective strategy at overcoming anxious attachment because it’s a powerful metaphor. When we struggle in relationships, it’s often our inner child being projected into it.



To heal your inner child, you must look inward. It involves acknowledging and reparenting the suppressed inner child on a spiritual level. You have to gain that inner child’s trust, just as you earn it with anyone else. The inner child has long been unkind and neglected, so on a fundamental level, building this inner trust lets you tap into it.

How? You earn your inner child’s trust through consistent action and behavior. You must create cohesiveness between what you say and what you do by honoring your needs no matter what. You must start to believe that you deserve your needs and are free to feel as you do, no matter what. Basically, you need to stop letting people walk all over you and fight for your inner child. 

Once we claim that child as our own, we commit ourselves to love that child. We must feed that child, defend that child, and give it what it needs to really grow and mature in a healthy way. As a result, we are filled with a deep loving feeling that is both giving and receiving.

In a relationship, you must learn to prioritize your own needs as much as your partners – not more and not less. Otherwise, there will always be a toxic imbalance and you could get stuck in the validation trap. You need to stop looking to others to validate your own growth. You must fix what’s within yourself, then see how that projects onto others.

Healing your inner child can also be accomplished through therapy or creative exercises, like those in my online courses. 

Another method of overcoming anxious attachment in relationships is to self-soothe. This includes learning to cope with jealousy.



As an anxious partner, you may experience jealousy a lot as a result of the nature of your insecurity. You may see your partner experiencing jealousy too, and this just feels like proof positive of reciprocated feelings. 

Jealousy can be interpreted in many different ways. For an anxious Open Heart, jealousy might make them feel closer to their partner, because it’s a powerful emotion that makes them feel alive, crystal clear about their feelings, and laser focused on what they want. If their partner feels jealous, that  makes them feel even more connected, because it seems like proof positive that they care. But for obvious reasons, this lifestyle isn’t going to lead you to a secure relationship style. You must confront jealousy. 

Coping with jealousy via self-soothing begins with realizing that jealousy is often a defensive coping strategy for anxious attachment, and it points to what we are afraid of losing. This fear of loss usually predates your current partner, and/or the object at hand. Healing your inner child will help reveal the root pain of this fear, and help you become more satisfied internally.

Next, it’s important to realize that jealousy can deepen your relationship, if approached in a certain way. If you can be honest about your feelings of jealousy (and all feelings!), this can give your partner a window into your more vulnerable self, and establish a deeper, more secure connection. Now, your partner has an opportunity to make conscious efforts to meet your needs authentically and honestly.

Furthermore, listening to your jealousy may help you gain access to your deepest needs around self-esteem. Feelings of not being good enough, feelings of shame, or fears of failure, or feeling discredited, or disrespected, or undervalued in some way, often lurk behind the umbrella emotion of jealousy. If we can address these subtler emotions with a more nuanced and mindful perspective, it can open you up to experience a much wider and more fulfilling range of emotion, and life satisfaction. Thus, jealousy is a poignant reminder that we need to take care of ourselves. 

It might help to think about why you’re jealous. Are you comparing the worst of what we have to the best of what we perceive someone else has? If so, think back on what we discussed earlier: You are the hero of your own story. Step out of your triggered fog and remember that you are in control of your own emotions.

What is your attachment style?

>>TAKE THE QUIZ<<

That’s it. Now you know all about anxious attachment in relationships.

In the end, learning what your attachment style is can help you and your partner tremendously. If you’re someone with anxious attachment, or dating someone who has anxious attachment, practice recognizing triggering behaviors and do your best to have patience. It takes time to reframe how you act in a relationship, but you all have the potential to move on to a secure attachment style.

想改善与伴侣的亲密关系，最好了解一下依恋类型

Gone Girl

之前回答了一个问题：男朋友对我态度冷淡，应该怎么办？发现许多朋友对其中的亲密关系测验很感兴趣，而且测完之后发觉自己属于非安全型依恋，来具体询问怎么办，所以特别整理了早先所学，尽量通俗易懂地从依恋的概念、儿童的依恋类型和成人的依恋类型三个方面来说明我们如今的依恋类型是如何产生的，又是如何影响我们与他人发展亲密关系的，最后，稍加探讨如何转变依恋类型。

依恋

依恋这个概念最早是由英国精神病学家鲍尔比(John Bowlby，1969)提出的，他在洛伦兹(Konrad Lorenz)的研究(婴儿对母亲的印刻理论)和哈洛(Harry Harlow)的实验(幼猴尽管由铁丝做的母猴喂养，但却寻求依偎于有绒织物的母猴)的基础上，将依恋定义为“个体与具有特殊意义的他人形成牢固的情感纽带的倾向，能为个体提供安全和安慰”。鲍尔比提出依恋这个概念主要是用来解释婴儿与其养护者之间的情感联系，但后来的研究者们将之扩展到了成人之间。

现在我们一般认为，依恋(attachment)是个体与主要抚养者发展出的一种特殊的、积极的情感纽带，也是指个体寻求并企图与另一个体在身体和情感上保持亲密联系的倾向。

依恋既是个体最初的社会性联结，也是情感社会化的重要标志。简单来说，通过依恋他人我们不再是一个孤单的个体，而是一个融入了集体的社会人。

了解的依恋的基本内涵，接下来，我们来看看依恋类型这个概念又是如何提出的。

儿童的依恋类型

说到依恋类型(attachment styles)，就不能不提到陌生情境实验(Strange Situation)，该实验是由艾斯沃斯等(Mary Ainsworth & Witting,1969)设计的，他们首先安排母婴在一个完全陌生的环境中，然后让婴儿分别经历母亲离开、陌生人进入等情境。观察婴儿在与母亲分离和相聚的过程中，以及面对陌生人的过程中的表现，从而对婴儿的依恋类型进行判断。具体如下：



注：第一个场景持续 30 秒，其余各场景均为 3 分钟。

艾斯沃斯等人长期观察了乌干达和美国家庭母子间的相互作用，利用上述研究方法，根据婴儿在陌生情境中的不同反应，将婴儿依恋划分为以下三种类型：

① 安全型依恋(secure attachment)

主要表现为在与母亲一起时，将其作为“安全基地”，以母亲为中心主动去探索环境，并不是总以为在母亲身旁，只通过偶尔的靠近或眼神注视与母亲交流，母亲在场时，婴儿感到足够的安全；当母亲离开时，明显表现出苦恼、不安；但当母亲回来时，会立即寻求与母亲接触，将其作为“避风港湾”，易被安抚。约占 65%～70%。

而安全型婴儿的母亲一般对孩子的信号及情绪表达（呼求、肢体动作等）很敏感，能及时了解孩子的想法，鼓励孩子进行探索，而且喜欢和孩子有亲密的接触。

② 回避型依恋(avoidant attachment)

主要表现为与母亲刚分离时并不难过，但独自在陌生环境中呆一段时间后会感到焦虑。容易与陌生人相处，容易适应陌生的环境，很容易从陌生人那里获得安慰。当分离后再见到母亲时，对母亲采取回避态度；有人也把这类婴儿称为“无依恋婴儿”。约占 20%。

回避型婴儿的母亲有多种类型。有的对孩子缺乏耐心，当孩子干扰自己的计划和活动时生孩子气或怨恨孩子，对孩子的信号反应迟钝；有的对孩子经常表现出消极情感，即使对孩子表达积极情感，程度也很微弱……因此两者之间并没有形成特别密切的感情联结。

③ 焦虑—矛盾型依恋(anxious-ambivalent attachment)

主要表现为每当母亲要离开前就显得很警惕，当母亲离开时表现得非常苦恼、极度反抗，任何一次短暂的分离都会引起大喊大叫。但当母亲回来时，其对母亲的态度又是矛盾的，既寻求与母亲接触，但同时又反抗与母亲接触。当母亲亲近他时，生气地拒绝、推开，但是要他重新回去做游戏似乎又不太容易，不时朝母亲这里看。约占 10%～15%。

反抗型婴儿的母亲常误解孩子的信号，她的照顾行为是不一致的，对孩子的反应更多地依赖于自己当时的心境，而不是孩子的行为。因此，在孩子的信号和母亲的情绪表达间常表现出不一致。

在这三种依恋类型中，回避型与反抗型都属于不安全型依恋。婴儿对母亲的依恋类型既具有明显的稳定性，但同时，在家庭环境经历较大变化，母亲与婴儿的交往发生较大转变时，也可能发生变化。

那么，问题来了，依恋类型的差异是如何产生的呢？

这是一个复杂的问题，在这简单说说。

依恋类型差异的产生

心理学中一直存在着关于遗传与环境（或者说，天性与教养）的争论(nature-nurture controversy)，即人的发展是在出生之前就由遗传和生物因素预先决定的，还是受后天经验和环境因素决定的？

现在，我们一般认为：遗传是心理发展的生物前提，环境是心理发展的决定性条件(其中教育条件在个体心理发展中起着主导作用)。遗传与环境互相作用和影响，共同决定着个体的发展，对于不同的心理因素，它们所起作用的比例不同。

所以，依恋类型差异的产生既与个体本身先天的生物因素有关，也与后天的教养、所处的家庭环境等有关。

儿童先天特质尤其是气质与母亲的抚养困难程度密切相关，比如，我们常会看到一些儿童容易照料，与母亲关系融洽，容易接受抚慰；一些儿童很难照料，异常活跃，拒绝母亲的亲近，不易抚慰。【注意！这里的气质需与生活中常说的气质区分开来~ 心理学中气质(temperament)是指一个人与生俱来的一种稳定的心理特征，即我们平时所说的脾气、秉性，主要表现在心理活动的强度、速度、灵活性与指向性等方面的。人的气质差异是先天形成的，受神经系统活动过程的特性所制约。孩子刚出生时，最先表现出来的差异就是气质差异，比如有的孩子爱哭好动，有的孩子平稳安静。】

而关于后天影响依恋的家庭因素，鲍尔比提出在个体和依恋对象的实际交往中形成了个体和看护者（主要抚养者）之间的内部工作模式(internal working models)，该模式包括两种互为补充的成分：一个是关于依恋对象的，描述的是当婴儿需要时，看护者是否是可得的(available)、敏感的(sensitive)和有反应的(responsive)；另一个是关于自己的，涉及的是自我是否是有价值或值得关爱和看护的。例如：当需要时，看护者是敏感并总是可得的，那么婴儿就会发展出一种认为别人是有反应并可信的、自己是可爱的并有被照顾价值的内部工作模式。反之，当看护者是不一致和拒绝的，婴儿就有可能发展出别人是没有反应的、自己是不值得关爱的或自己是应该自我满足的和不需要别人关爱的。如此，内部工作模式构建了个体对早期依恋经验的心理表征，并在长大后影响其思想、情感和行为。

现在一般认为婴儿依恋的性质最根本取决于与婴儿有关的看护者的行为，依恋是在婴儿与看护者的相互交往和感情交流中逐渐形成的，在这一社会交往过程中，母亲对婴儿所发出的信号的敏感性和其对婴儿是否关心是最重要的方面。

由儿童过渡到成人 

在鲍尔比、艾斯沃斯等人之后，随着研究对象的不断扩展，研究者们开始讨论依恋原理与成人的亲密关系之间的相关性。通常认为，婴儿的依恋功能包括“维持亲密”（试图寻求和保持与依恋对象的亲近）和“抗拒分离”（寻求与看护者的亲密，拒绝分离）；“安全基地”（把依恋对象作为其探索外部世界的安全港湾）和“避风港湾”（当受到威胁的时候寻求依恋对象的帮助，获得安全）。进一步的研究发现，早期的人际经验会影响个体后来人际关系发展轨迹：安全型依恋的儿童快乐地与他人交往，很容易与他人发展出轻松信任的人际关系；回避型依恋的儿童经常怀疑和迁怒他人，不容易形成信任和亲密的人际关系；焦虑—矛盾型依恋的儿童与他人的关系常会变得紧张和过分依赖，表现出对他人的过分贪求。

Hazan & Shaver 于 1987 年在《婚恋关系是一种依恋关系》(Romantic Love Conceptualized as an Attachment Process)一文中第一次提出成人婚恋关系中的情感联结也可以被理解为一种依恋关系，它有着和早期依恋相似的生物系统，都是自然选择的产物。他们的研究表明成人在处理亲密关系时也会表现出类似的反应方式，婴儿的依恋系统特征——维持亲密，抗拒分离，安全基地和避风港湾——同样可以在成人的亲密关系中观察到。由此，依恋研究迅速成为人际关系科学最热的研究领域之一，而从成人依恋的角度研究亲密关系开始成为依恋研究热点领域，随之各种具有启发性的研究成果的陆续公布。

成人的依恋类型

当依恋理论发展到成人依恋领域的时候，Hazan & Shaver(1988)通过问卷调查提出：早期社会经验不同产生了关系风格上相对持久的差异，婴儿依恋中的三种主要的依恋类型(安全型、回避型、矛盾型)在成人的恋情中也得到了证实。在 Hazan 和 Shaver 提出婚恋依恋分为三种类型这一观点后，引来众多依恋专家的关注。1991 年，Barthofomew & Horowitz 的实验提出 Hazan 和 Shaver 之前所提出的回避型其实是两种完全不同的回避型，他们认为人们之所以要避免和他人亲密接触，是因为存在两种不同的原因。一种情况是人们期望和他人交往，但又对他人戒心重重，害怕被人拒绝和欺骗。另一种情况是人们独立自主、自力更生，真正地喜欢我行我素和自由自在，而不愿意与他人发生紧密的依恋关系。这就将成人的依恋类型分为了四种而非三种。

具体来说，成人的四种依恋类型如下：

第一种是安全型(secure)或安全—自主型(secure-autonomous)，和儿童的安全型依恋基本相同。这种类型的人认为自己是值得爱的，他人也是值得爱和信任的。

安全型依恋是一种稳定和积极的情绪联系，以爱情关系中的关怀、亲密感、支持和理解为标志的。这种类型的人认为自己是友好、善良和可爱的人，也认为别人普遍是友好、可靠和值得信赖的人。他们十分容易与其他人接近，总是放心地依赖他人和让别人依赖自己。一般来说，他们既不会过于担心被抛弃，也不怕别人在感情上与自己过于亲近。无论我们自己的依恋方式属于哪一种，大多数人都希望能找到一个安全依恋型的人做自己的伴侣。

第二种痴迷型(preoccupied)，是给予焦虑—矛盾型的新名称，因为这种类型的人若要感觉心安，就得过分地依赖于他人的赞许，所以他们过度地寻求认同，沉溺于人际关系。他们认为自己是不值得爱的和没有价值的，但是他人是可接受的，总是努力赢得他人的接纳，并以此支持消极的自我形象。

痴迷型依恋的特征是对人际关系怀着混合的情感，这就使人处于爱、恨、怀疑、拿不起、放不下的冲突情感之中，导致一种不稳定和矛盾的心理状态。通常，痴迷型的人总觉得自己被误解和不受赏识，认为自己的情人和朋友都不可靠，不愿意与自己建立持久的关系。矛盾依恋型的人担心他们的恋人并不真正爱自己，或者会离开自己。因此，他们一方面希望能与自己的恋人极为亲近，另一方面又对恋人是否可靠和可信满腹猜疑。

第三种和第四种依恋类型反映了两种不同的“回避型”。

回避型依恋常常表现出惧怕亲密关系和拒绝信赖别人的倾向。回避型依恋的人往往在关系未能向好的方向转变之前就开始退缩，他们对爱情多疑且冷淡，认为别人不可靠或过分急于对爱情做出承诺。结果是他们觉得难以完全相信和依赖别人，只要有人试图在感情上亲近他们，他们就开始紧张。从根本上讲，他们在回避亲密的关系。

恐惧型(fearful)的人对自己和他人的态度都是消极的，这种类型的成人可能出于害怕被拒绝而极力避免和他人发生亲密关系。虽然他们希望有人喜欢自己，但更担心自己因此离不开别人，而一旦建立了亲密关系，又往往会过度担心伴侣会离开自己，整天提心吊胆地防止冲突和其他代价过高的关系，有时想到与伴侣亲密相处时他们就会感到恐惧。

而疏离型(dismissing)的人对个人的看法相对积极（自己是有价值的），但是认为他人会拒绝自己，和他人发生亲密关系得不偿失。这种类型的成人会以避免与他人发生联系来作为保护自己不受伤害的手段。他们拒绝和他人相互依赖，因为他们相信自己能自力更生，也不在乎他人是否喜欢自己。他们会更关注替代选择，会留心任何可能的其他爱情选择，并且更容易被新结识的人所吸引。他们希望将来的伴侣不给他们提供帮助，因为他们不打算反过来做任何报答。

整体而言，安全依恋是以个体能够流畅地表达与依恋相关的经历和情感为特征的, 安全依恋使得人们可以更加准确地处理与同伴之间的相似经历和情感, 而不安全依恋是以防御性地拒绝或不能够整合与依恋经历有关的各种信息为特征的, 这会导致个体与他人之间沟通不畅、对他人抱有消极期待以及自身社会功能出现问题。

之后，Brennan, Clark, & Shaver（1998）用维度法来考察依恋风格, 他们认为, 依恋类型可以被概括为回避亲密和忧虑被弃两个维度。

回避亲密(avoidance of intimacy)的不同主要体现在会影响人们接纳相互依赖的亲密关系的难度和信任程度。在亲密关系中感到舒心和轻松的人，回避亲密的程度就低；而与伴侣亲密接触时烦躁不安的人，其回避亲密的程度就高。

忧虑被弃(anxiety about abandonment)的不同主要体现在是否会害怕他人认为自己没有价值而远离自己。安全性的人在与他人亲密接触中非常安心，不会担心别人会苛刻地对待自己，因而能积极快乐地寻求亲密、相互依赖的人际关系。相形之下，其他三种类型的人充满焦虑和不安，在亲密关系中如坐针毡。痴迷型的人渴望亲密接触但害怕被拒绝。疏离型的人并不担心被拒绝，但却不喜欢亲密接触。至于恐惧型的人则两者兼而有之，在亲密关系中坐立不安又担心亲密关系不能长久。

如果将类型法和维度法综合起来考虑, 那么我们可以得到一个两维度四分类。在这两个维度——回避亲密和忧虑被弃上的得分高低决定了成人依恋的不同类型：安全型——低回避、低焦虑；痴迷型——低回避，高焦虑；恐惧型——高回避、高焦虑；疏离型——高回避、低焦虑。

综上所述，我们可以得到下图：



关于这幅图，需要特别注意的是，回避亲密和忧虑被弃这两个依恋维度是由低到高连续变化的。这就意味着，虽然我们一直在讨论依恋类型的差异，好像它们不会重叠，是分离、纯粹的类别，但实际上并非如此。当要求被试从表中选出最符合自己的依恋类型时，大多数人认为自己是安全依恋型。然而，如果有人在回避亲密和忧虑被弃两个维度上都表现出中等水平，套用上述四种依恋类型中的任何一种都不太适合的。

或许，我们应该这么理解依恋的复杂性：存在忧虑和回避这两个重要因素，它们塑造了在人际交往中人们表现出的各种适应性行为。这两个因素都很重要，如果你比较任一维度上的高分和低分人群，就会发现他们处理人际关系的方式差别很大。而得分在中等水平则无关紧要，即使因为这些得分不同可以把他们归结为“安全型”和“疏离型”等不同的依恋风格。最近的依恋研究不再简单地把人们分为安全、痴迷、恐惧活疏远四种类型，而是给出人们在忧虑和回避两个维度中的相对位置。

尽管如此，把依恋类型分为四类简单明了，所以仍广泛使用，深入人心。但依恋风格差异最大的地方主要表现在安全型和不安全类型的人（高忧虑被弃或高回避亲密的人，或兼而有之）之间。

依恋类型的改变

依恋类型一旦形成，就决定了人们与他人交往时显示出的独特个体特征。这样，亲密关系中，双方某些依恋类型的匹配可能比其他的匹配要好得多，更让人满足和稳定。举例来说，假若痴迷型的人爱上疏离型的人，就产生了依恋类型的不匹配。痴迷型的人会因为对方的感情疏远而气馁，而疏离型的人则会因对方的依赖干预而烦恼，双方都不如与安全型的人相处轻松。

前面说了，依恋类型一方面受到与生俱来的个体特质（如气质）的影响，另一方面个体经验在塑造人际关系的 依恋类型上起着重要作用。所以，我们并不会只是被动的受到童年经验的束缚，依恋类型不断地受到我们成人后经历的影响。不过，尽管依恋类型能改变，但它们确定后相当稳定而持久，并影响人们建立新的人际关系。有关研究表明，如果没有大起大落的新经历，人们的依恋类型可以持续数十年不变。

那么，如果你属于不安全依恋，而又想改变自己（或者，你的 TA 是不安全依恋，你想改变 TA），该怎么办呢？大家的情况不同，有着各自的特殊之处，这里只能就其原则泛泛而谈咯（￣y▽￣）~

首先，希望你们共同来了解依恋理论，可以看我这篇科普文，也可以看其他更详细的书籍，比如这本：心理治疗中的依恋 (豆瓣)。很多时候，了解就是改变的动力源泉。

其次，不管是你自己或你的伴侣属于不安全依恋，都希望你们能够接纳自己，自我接纳是什么意思，又为何要自我接纳，可参看：为什么心理咨询要把接纳自己作为一件很重要的事去强调？ - 动机在杭州的回答。很多时候，接纳是改变的核心基础。

最后，既然治疗师可以通过与来访者之间建立亲密的依恋关系来使来访者重塑依恋类型，那为什么作为情侣的你们不能在自己的亲密关系中成长呢？

我相信，如果情侣双方共同理解自己的依恋特征及其形成的原因，在接纳自己行为和情绪的基础上对恋爱中的矛盾获得新的认知和评价，并且通过亲密关系中的积极体验改善自己的人际期望、情感体验定势和对他人与自我的表征性质，就可以实现亲密关系质量改善和个人安全成长的双向促进。

在这个过程中，个人以为双方的良好沟通是处理冲突、相互理解、包容接纳的基础，更是形成亲密关系中积极体验所不可或缺的。关于伴侣间如何沟通，可参看：如何维护长期的恋爱关系？ - 张俊杰的回答。

# 亲密关系中的识别情绪模式 | 你是哪种“依恋类型”？ • 6秒钟情商官网

 由 Huang, Chamie | 7 月 3, 2020 | 6秒钟, 生活情商 | 0 条评论

每个人都有一些“好模式”和“坏模式”，如果我们不想一次又一次地重复同样的错误，首先要做的就是意识到“问题出在哪里”。本篇文章帮助我们探索自己在亲密关系中的模式，并了解这些模式是如何影响着我们建立和打破关系。

伴侣之间有时会发生争吵，虽然这种场景不常发生，但每一次都很伤人。

妻子回家发现家里有几处衣服，于是抱怨了一句：“你为什么每次都把衣服乱扔！？”，两个人开始为此进行对话，在你一言我一语的过程中，和“反抗”相关的模式被激活，为了证明自己才是对的那一个，对话升级为争吵。

丈夫可能因此被压得喘不过气来，需要独处才能回到安全和爱的状态。妻子可能因此委屈地哭泣，继续不断地诉说，需要一个肯定回应才能安定心神。

依恋类型 Attachment Style

“依恋类型”这个概念最早是由英国精神病学家鲍尔比(John Bowlby，1969)提出的，他将依恋定义为“个体与具有特殊意义的他人形成牢固的情感纽带的倾向，能为个体提供安全和安慰”。

鲍尔比最早提出依恋这个概念主要是用来解释婴儿与其养护者之间的情感联系，但后来的研究者们将之扩展到了成人之间。

现在依恋(Attachment)主要指：个体与主要抚养者发展出的一种特殊的、积极的情感纽带，也是指个体寻求并企图与另一个体在身体和情感上保持亲密联系的倾向。

阅读以下描述，看看你属于三种类型中的哪种依恋类型？

◈ 焦虑（对抗）型 Anxious-resistant

你需要从伴侣那里得到许多关注才能感觉到被爱。你经常会有一种“距离感”，你可能讨厌带着愤怒说晚安，你需要先解决争吵，才能再次感到“完整”。可能表现的比较“黏人”或“需要帮助”。

◈ 安全型 Secure

你乐于给予和接受关注，与对方距离太远或太近时，你都意识到，然后会要求更多的空间或更多的关注来让自己感到舒服。你认定的事情不会因他人的行为而受到影响。

◈ 回避型 Avoidant

你非常重视独立和个人空间，可能不太愿意给予或接受感情。当一段感情开始后，你很快就会意识到这需要你放弃独立，所以可能难长时间维持一段感情。你可能会听到他人评价你有些自私或冷漠。

在这些描述中，你认出自己和伴侣了吗？每个依恋类型都会有相似的一些“模式”，而在亲密关系中，每个人也可以通过脱离自动驾驶模式，有意识地选择或改变自己的模式，来更好的支持彼此。

接下来，一起看一些故事和例子吧。

 

焦虑对抗型 vs 回避型 

在争论期间，回避型Andy想要独处的空间，而焦虑对抗型Judy却想要在一起。花了一段时间，他们终于认识到双方的不同模式。当Andy发现自己不知所措时，他想找到最近的出口，独处一段时间。而Judy感到难过时，希望自己可以更多的被关注和照顾。Andy和Judy共同讨论两人的模式，并运用同理心去理解对方的观点，他们商量出一个共同的策略。

当他们吵架时，Andy会有一段自己的时间，可以是30分钟，3个小时，一天……但需要事先告知Judy。时间到了后，Andy会充满能量的回来。而Judy知道了Andy的独处时间是多久，她会因此感到安全。在这段时间里，她能够专注于自己，比如与家人聊天、和朋友逛街等。Judy也会轻轻地提醒Andy，他们有一个共同的约定。在这种情况下，他们两个互相满足了对方的需求。

回避型 vs 回避型 

Lucy和Peter都是回避型的依恋类型，很多时候他们都宁愿一个人呆着。尽管他们都非常重视稳定以及家人关系，但他们很容易忘记保持良好的关系需要一些情感上的工作。于是他们发现双方的模式后，共同讨论了一个策略。

他们每周安排一次时间，以情侣的身份进行连接。他们共同撰写了一份文件，表达对方自己有多重要，在争论之后回看这份文件。除此之外，他们优先考虑各自的独处时间，有时也会利用这个时间来表达对彼此的爱。Lucy会为Peter写爱情日记，而Peter则会用心为Lucy挑选礼物。为了避免自己忽略对方的需求和感受，他们还找到了可信赖的咨询师来支持他们。他们虽然都是回避型，但也可以通过一起学习，相互支持，来体会爱这样一件美好、安全的事情。

焦虑对抗型 vs 焦虑对抗型 

John和Jane都是焦虑对抗型，平时他们甜蜜得似胶如漆，彼此间充满爱意。于是在争执时，他们都会希望得到对方的关注。但驾驭情绪对于同样是焦虑型的Jane和John，都很挑战，因此，为了更好地谈论和验证情绪，他们也共同制定了一个策略。

一旦有谁感到受伤，先准确地表达自己的感受，而不是使用置气、抱怨的方式进行交流，此时另一方需要表达爱、安全和谅解。这样不仅能共同满足彼此的需求，他们也体会到爱不一定是要每时每刻在一起，独处时也可以从自己的内心感受到爱与支持，并再稳定地给予对方。

不论是什么依恋类型，也不论是什么样的模式，建立长期幸福关系的技巧很简单：确保满足每个人的需求。识别情绪模式也不是为了改变，而是更有意识地选择更合适的回应。

那么，你在亲密关系中是属于哪种依恋类型？你的伴侣呢？针对你们相处的模式，可以共同制定什么样策略来让彼此的感情更为长久和稳定？

# 爱情关系的依恋风格理论



    根据一项新的研究发现，我们在恋爱中的行为表现由我们属于哪种依恋类型所决定。依恋类型可分为躲避型、焦虑型、安全型三种。所有人，不管是刚刚开始约会还是已经结婚40年之久，都属于其中一种。通过了解自己处于哪一类型，我们便可以找到与自己最匹配的伴侣，便可以从一个全新的角度看待自己以及伴侣的行为，从而增进与伴侣之间的感情与了解。

如果你是单身并正在寻找自己的另一半，这种了解能够帮助你找到合适的伴侣；如果已经坠入爱河或者步入婚姻，这种了解则可帮助你进一步洞察自己的行为和想法。无论是哪一种情况，你都将改变自己，变得比以前更加出色，在爱情旅途上走得更加顺畅。

研究依恋类型的科学建立在这样一种事实之上，即从生物学的角度说，我们都有收获爱情的渴望。虽然我们所处的文化环境一直在教育我们学会独立，但任何人都不希望单身一人走向生命的终点，其实都希望拥有属于自己的另一半。研究也发现，良好的爱情和婚姻关系能够延长一个人的寿命和增进健康，有人陪伴自己共同面对生活的挑战至关重要。

我们的大脑拥有一种生物学机制，也就是所说的“依恋系统”，涉及到情绪、情感和行为，帮助我们与所爱的人永远厮守。这一系统能够解释孩子为何在离开母亲后变得歇斯底里，他们会疯狂寻找或者大哭大闹，行为失去控制，母亲回到身边后，他们则恢复平静。此外，这一系统同样能够解释成年人在恋爱和婚姻中的种种行为表现。

我们都有依恋他人的需要，但表现不尽相同。上世纪60年代进行的实验发现，婴儿分安全型、焦虑型或者躲避型3种类型。如果安全型婴儿的母亲走出房间，他们就会哭，母亲回到房间后，他们便安静下来，继续玩玩具。焦虑型婴儿则表现的很哀伤，母亲回来后，他们会推开母亲，然后大哭。躲避型婴儿在母亲离开和返回房间时会表现的若无其事，好像什么都没有发生一样。但测试结果显示，他们的心跳次数、应激激素和皮质醇水平都呈升高趋势。

研究显示成年人在恋爱中的行为与婴儿存在惊人的相似性。一个人的依恋类型取决于成长环境和步入成年后的经历，能够决定一个人在恋爱中的行为表现。总体上说，安全型喜欢彼此间的亲密行为，通常温柔多情。焦虑型渴望亲密，将全部精力都投入到恋爱当中，往往担心伴侣在恋爱交往中的互动能力，担心付出得不到回报。躲避型将亲密视为丧失独立性，喜欢与伴侣保持一段距离。

在依恋类型理论面前，你的行为以及伴侣的行为不再令人莫名其妙和复杂难懂，而是具有可预见性。以下是3种依恋类型介绍：

焦虑型

焦虑型拥有与伴侣保持亲密关系的能力，但往往担心伴侣不会像希望的那样与自己保持亲密。这种类型的人在恋爱中消耗大量情感能量，他们对伴侣情绪的微小波动非常敏感，过于用自己的想法看待伴侣的行为。在无法听到伴侣的声音或者感觉另一半逐渐与自己疏远时，焦虑型往往会通过以下方式表达自己的忧虑情绪。

1．在等待伴侣打来电话的同时不停打电话、发短信或者发邮件，在伴侣工作的地方附近徘徊，希望早一点见到他。

2．伴侣回电话或者回家后，对他们不理不睬，以示惩罚。在他们开口讲话或者离开房间时，对他们飘白眼，暗示自己并不在意。

3．威胁要离开他，实际上却是希望他留下来。

4．在他们面前谈论其他男人，让他们感到嫉妒。

这是一种过度敏感的依恋类型。即使一个小小的暗示都会让他们心神不安，很难平静下来，除非伴侣明确表示他们的爱恋关系很稳固，仍然深深地爱着自己。

躲避型

在躲避型眼里，保持独立非常重要，对独立的重视程度往往超过彼此间的亲密。他们也希望与伴侣亲密，但过度亲密又让他们感到不舒服，往往选择与伴侣保持一定距离。他们不会总担心遭到拒绝，往往不会敞开心扉，导致伴侣经常抱怨彼此间的距离感。在恋爱交往中，躲避型对伴侣控制或者侵犯其独立性的行为保持高度警惕。

无论是单身状态还是坠入爱河，躲避型都经常与对方保持一段距离。为了做到这一点，他们会采取一系列方式，其中包括以下这些行为：

1．会说“我没做好和你在一起的准备”，但两个人实际上还是会在一起，这种状态有时能持续多年。

2．很在意伴侣的缺点，例如讲话方式，着装方面的品味等等。

3．分手之后会产生强烈的渴望，等待属于自己的那个人出现。

4．与其他人调情，让自己的恋情产生不安全感。

5．不会说“我爱你”，即使对对方非常有感觉。

6．随着恋情的发展，他们会选择逃避，有时甚至不会赴约。

7．会坠入不可能有结果的恋情，例如喜欢上已婚男人。

8．躲避身体上的亲密接触，例如不喜欢睡在一张床上，不希望发生性关系，不喜欢并肩走，而是选择走在伴侣前面。

躲避型会选择这些方式让自己所爱的人不破坏自己的独立性。但这些方式也会阻碍恋情发展，最终与属于自己的幸福失之交臂。并不意味着与安全型交往不会出现问题。有时候，他们对焦虑或者疏远的行为过分宽容，不利于感情的发展。通常情况下，安全型能够对其他人产生神奇的影响，因为他们做的事情正是躲避型和焦虑型所希望的。他们能够满足对方的需求，让他们感受到被爱的感觉和安全感。

安全型

安全型在恋爱中对伴侣满怀爱意，表现出温柔多情的一面。他们享受与伴侣之间的亲密，同时不会对恋情过分担心。他们能够有效表达自己的情感，很善于发现和了解伴侣的情绪变化。他们与伴侣分享自己的成功和所遇到的问题，在他们需要的时候能够在他们身边提供帮助。安全型的特征包括以下这些：

1．他们很善于化解矛盾，发生冲突时不会表现出进攻性，事后也不会惩罚伴侣，同时很快就把不快忘得干干净净。

2．在心理上很具有柔韧性，愿意做出改变，满足伴侣的需要。

3．喜欢毫不隐瞒地表达自己的感受，不喜欢藏着掖着。

4．非常享受与伴侣间的亲密，享受性生活。

其他类型的人能够从安全型身上学到很多东西，但安全型采取的方式并不一定意味着恋情能够有一个完美的结局。如果长期容忍伴侣的坏习惯，把最终的裁决权交到伴侣手上，等待安全型的将是一段令人痛苦的恋情。

找到伴侣的型

了解依恋理论能够改变一个人看待新认识的伴侣的方式，了解现有伴侣的行为。有了这种了解之后，你不会再问自己：“他为什么总是疏远我？”而是会意识到：“他的疏远并不是因为我，他只是对过度亲密感到不舒服罢了。”此外，你也不会将太多精力花在“错误的人”身上。如果对方总是传递混杂的信号，令人无法捉摸，或者走到一起后让自己产生“我们没有未来”的想法，这个人基本上就是躲避型。人总是会在恋爱初期展露自己的一切，你要做的就是睁大眼睛，判断他属于哪种类型。

三种依恋类型的表现

焦虑型：渴望与伴侣亲密，会产生不安全感，担心遭到拒绝。单身时会感到不快乐，会想尽办法引起对方的注意和兴趣。经常让人无法理解什么事情惹他们生气，只能去猜。这种类型的人会怀疑对方有不忠行为。

躲避型：这种类型的人会在恋爱中释放出令对方困惑的信号，他们非常看重自己的独立性。与其他类型相比，他们不太重视对方的价值或者将前伴侣完美化，会采用疏远策略，这种疏远包括情感上和身体上的。他们对伴侣不信任，担心被伴侣控制而失去自我。他们不会明确表达自己的想法和意

图，也不愿谈及彼此的恋情进展到何种程度。

安全型：值得信赖，始终如一，会和你一起做决定，对恋情的态度具有柔韧性，善于与伴侣沟通。在发生争吵时，他们会选择妥协，他们愿意奉献，不担心自己依附对方，不喜欢隐藏自己的真实想法。

如何改善感情？

确定自己属于哪种依恋类型能够更好地了解自己在恋爱中的行为，进而让恋情更加甜蜜。我们没有必要为自己提出的各种要求感到歉意。感情容易激动并没有错，你可以坦白地对对方说：“我需要有人陪在我的身边，让我有一个依靠。”潜在伴侣的回答能够揭示出他在未来满足你这些需要的能力。如果你是焦虑型或者躲避型，有些事情是你不应该做的。如果现在坠入爱情，不要动不动就发脾气，伴侣没有及时回电话或者回家晚了，应该首先想想他们可能遇到什么抽不开身的事情，而不是上来就是抱怨。

研究发现，躲避型和焦虑型往往互相吸引，但彼此的特征会进一步恶化，导致焦虑型陷入永无休止的焦虑漩涡，渴望与对方亲近，而躲避型则进一步选择疏远。这并不是说他们无法获得快乐，他们需要共同努力，增进彼此的感情。通常情况下，焦虑型与躲避型都能与安全型亲密交往，是很好的一对。如果你是焦虑型，你最初可能会觉得安全型很令人厌烦，因为他们无法让你获得令人兴奋的情感上的起起落落，但交往一段时间你会发现，与这种类型的人共同生活如同发现一座金矿。

如果你是躲避型，你需要学会依赖和信赖对方，让他们有机会发现自己的错误，而不是选择疏远。不要将曾经的伴侣完美化，也不要等待所谓的理想伴侣。只有这样，你才能与对方更亲密。安全型伴侣不需要你为他付出很多，你可以变得更独立。虽然我们能够从安全型身上学到很多东西，但这

ABSTRACT

Since Dr. J. Bowlby first put forward the attachment theory, attachment styles have always been the focus of peopleâs attention. From the formation of attachment in an individualâs infancy, it is associated with an individualâs life. The purpose of this research is to start with the attachment theory, sort out the research on the attachment development and different attachment styles of individuals in their early and adolescence, analyze the reasons for the formation of individual attachment styles and the possible impact of attachment styles on individual development, and give relevant suggestions.

Keywords:Early Attachment, Attachment Styles, Psychological Development, Adult Marriage

传统依恋理论认为个体依恋心理和行为模式具有相对稳定性, 但无论在信息加工还是个体发展过程中, 个体依恋模式均表现出二重性, 即既具有相对稳定性, 又具有情境敏感性。个体在情境中所表现出的依恋模式是个体相对稳定的特质性依恋和情境特征相互作用的结果。依恋启动研究中特质性依恋特征与依恋启动效应之间的交互作用模式为理解依恋二重特征及其关系提供了窗口。依恋系统激活的两阶段模型为整合和解释这些相互作用模式提供了框架。未来研究应优化依恋二重特征关系研究中启动效应的操作检验, 考虑依恋焦虑和回避维度的交互作用, 关注高焦虑群体内的依恋差异, 以理析依恋二重特征之间的相互作用方式, 同时关注依恋策略影响依恋启动效应的时间进程, 探究依恋二重特征相互作用的机制。

Traditional attachment theory suggests that an individual’s attachment-related psychological and behavioral patterns are relatively stable. However, from information processes or life-span development perspective, attachment patterns have trait-state duality, i.e. attachment patterns are both relatively stable and context-sensitive. An individual’s attachment pattern in a particular context is the consequence of his or her trait attachment and contextual feature interactions. The interaction patterns between trait attachment and attachment priming effects provide a window to understand the duality of attachment and their relationships. And the two-stages model of attachment activation offers a framework for integrating and understanding these patterns. Future studies should optimize the manipulation check of attachment priming, meanwhile, take the interaction between attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety in consideration. More attention should be paid to the individual differences in the high attachment anxiety group which may clarify the patterns of interaction between trait and state attachment. Moreover, the time course of how attachment coping strategies impact the effects of attachment priming should be concerned, which could reveal the mechanism of the interactions between trait and state attachment.

基于生命早期经验形成的依恋心理和行为模式具有相对稳定性, 会对个体生命全程的人际关系、人格发展等产生深远影响是依恋理论的核心假设之一(Raby & Dozier, 2019)。但实证研究对这一观点提出了挑战, 纵向研究表明早期依恋模式与之后不同时期依恋模式的相关性较低(Fraley & Roisman, 2019)。同时, 社会认知研究发现个体依恋相关心理和行为会受当前情境影响, 暂时表现出不同于个体长期占主导地位的依恋模式的特征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016a, 2016b)。可见, 个体依恋心理和行为模式既有相对稳定性, 也有情境敏感性。换句话说, 情境中个体的依恋心理和行为特征处于稳定性和情境引致变化性的张力中, 如同路边的树, 没有风的时候指向其经年累月形成的固定方向, 风吹来, 树的朝向则会随风而变, 风一停止, 则又恢复到原来的朝向。

社会认知范式为研究情境对依恋的影响以及个体依恋特征与情境的交互作用提供了有效工具和新证据, 但个体依恋特征具有二重性的观点也见于传统依恋研究文献中。研究者遵循Bowlby (1969/1982)以及Ainsworth, Bell和Stayton (1972)强调依恋个体差异的传统, 将个体依恋特征视为一种具有跨时空、跨情境稳定性的特质。受此研究思路的影响, 依恋类型的划分、稳定性及早期依恋经验对个体之后各领域发展的影响等问题一直是依恋研究的焦点。但Bowlby (1969/1982, 1973)在论述依恋特征具有相对稳定性的同时, 也强调个体依恋系统具有情境敏感性, 即个体依恋系统受情境因素的影响而被激活或终止激活。但由于研究方法的限制, 直至最近20年, 依恋稳定性与情境敏感性问题才得到系统研究。研究者借鉴社会认知领域的相关理论和研究范式, 开始关注依恋个体差异背后的认知加工过程, 证实了个体依恋相关心理和行为特征会因情境作用表现出不同于个体长期依恋模式的状态性特征(Fraley, 2007; Gillath, Hart, Noftle, & Stockdale, 2009)。同时, 个体较稳定的依恋特征与依恋相关情境特征共同决定了个体在某一依恋情境中最终的心理和行为表现(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016a)。

个体心理和行为模式的稳定性和变化性问题始终是人格、自我领域关注的重要问题(Conway, Singer, & Tagini, 2004)。理解个体依恋特征既具有相对稳定性又具有情境敏感性, 以及个体稳定性依恋特征如何与情境交互作用共同影响个体在某一具体情境中的依恋表现, 有助于加深人们对个体如何应对情境中依恋刺激的理解, 以及对依恋行为在进化中适应意义的认识。本文首先将讨论个体依恋二重特征的定义及其在信息加工和个体发展中的表现, 继而梳理依恋启动研究中特质性依恋与依恋启动效应的交互作用模式, 最后以依恋系统激活两阶段模型对这些交互作用模式进行整合和解释, 以期助益于将来相关研究的开展。

依恋特征是由与依恋相关的知识、情绪、认知加工和行为等构成的集群(constellation)或模式(Fraley & Roisman, 2019)。学者分别使用“特质性依恋(trait attachment)”和“状态性依恋(state attachment)” 描述个体在依恋相关情境中表现出来的相对稳定的心理和行为特征和因情境刺激变化而暂时表现出的不同于个体稳定特征的暂时性特征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2017)。潜在状态-特质理论认为, 个体的心理和行为取决于个体特征, 情境特征和个体与情境的交互作用。同时, 个体在具体情境中的心理和行为特征会随情境变化而变化, 从这个意义上讲, 个体在某一情境中表现出的心理和行为特征均是状态性的(Steyer, Schmitt, & Eid, 1999)。按该理论, 个体在具体情境中表现出的依恋特征均是状态性依恋, 且状态性依恋特征是由个体特质性依恋特征、情境特征以及两者的交互作用决定的。以下将在“个体-情境”框架下, 从信息加工的视角对特质性依恋和状态性依恋进行界定和说明。

特质性依恋是个体依恋特征中具有相对稳定性和跨时空一致性的特征, 它反映了个体较长时间内依恋特征的平均水平。个体会在长期依恋互动经验中形成相对稳定的依恋表征和图式, 其中占主导地位的依恋图式会影响个体在某一情境中的依恋心理和行为。特质性依恋有助于个体避免陷于无序和混乱中, 对保持自我同一性和连续性十分重要, 同时该类特征有助于人们对依恋相关心理和行为进行解释和预测。在传统依恋研究中, 研究者多使用依恋类型对个体依恋行为特征进行描述和组织, 如陌生情景测验、Q分类法、故事完成测验、成人依恋访谈、当前关系访谈 (Ainsworth et al., 1972; Ainsworth, Bell, & Stayton, 1971; Bretherton, Ridgeway, & Cassidy, 1990; Crowell & Owens, 1996; Hazan & Shaver, 1987; Waters & Deane, 1985), 研究发现使用依恋维度描述个体依恋特征可能比采用依恋类型更具优势(Fraley, Hundson, Heffernan, & Segal, 2015), 常用测量依恋维度的工具包括亲密关系经历问卷和父母与同伴依恋问卷等(Armsden & Greenberg, 1987; Brennan, Clark, & Shaver, 1998)。但无论类型法还是维度法, 均假设个体存在稳定的依恋模式, 依恋模式作为一种特质具有跨时间和跨情境一致性, 且存在个体差异。个体依恋类型或依恋维度旨在捕捉个体在较长时间内、在不同情境下均会表现出的依恋特征。

状态性依恋是个体特质性依恋与其所处具体情境共同作用所表现出来的心理和行为特征。个体所处情境既包括外源性特征, 如情境中危险线索, 依恋对象的声音或照片等, 也包括内源性特征, 如个体回忆和心境等。因情境特征的复杂、多变, 状态性依恋常表现出不同于特质性依恋的特征。状态性依恋意味着个体嵌套于当前情境中, 个体的依恋反应是灵活且可修正的, 该类特征有助于个体适应当前环境。尽管Bowlby (1969/1982)提出依恋系统具有情境敏感性, 个体依恋特征并非静态、不变的, 但后来研究者仅将情境特征变化作为捕获个体特质性依恋的工具和方法, 如在陌生情境测验中, 研究者通过操纵情境(母婴分离和团聚)引发婴幼儿的依恋行为, 以对母婴依恋关系进行分类(Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978)。随着依恋研究中认知转向的出现, 研究者开始借鉴认知心理学的实验范式, 特别是启动范式, 对情境线索如何影响依恋相关心理和行为进行研究(Bryant & Bali, 2018; Gillath & Karantzas, 2018; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2017)。在依恋启动研究中, 研究者通过操纵刺激材料改变个体所处情境的特征, 探究个体特质性依恋与情境的交互作用。在依恋启动范式中, 启动效应是状态性依恋的表现或其发挥作用的结果, 研究者通过依恋启动效应可以深入了解状态性依恋。

传统社会和人格研究中, 常以“时间”作为特质性和状态性心理和行为划分的标准, 如Gillath等(2009)开发的成人状态依恋问卷(State Adult Attachment Measure, SAAM)即将依恋行为特征的持续时间作为区分特质性依恋和状态性依恋的标准。而本文对特质性依恋和状态性依恋的界定是从信息加工过程的角度进行的。特质性依恋反映了个体长期依恋特征的平均水平, 而状态性依恋因为情境的复杂、变化性, 常表现为对特质性依恋的暂时偏离。

依恋特征的二重性与信息加工中自上而下和自下而上两类加工过程密切相关。从信息加工的视角看, 个体在依恋相关任务中的表现, 既包含自上而下依恋表征驱动的加工过程, 也包括自下而上情境线索驱动的加工过程(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016b), 两者共同决定了个体最终表现出的心理和行为特征。个体生而具有的依恋系统会对当前依恋相关物理和心理线索和依恋对象可用性(availability)进行评估, 并结合内部工作模式设定个体当前依恋目标 (Bretherton, 1985)。依恋目标驱使个体在需要时向重要他人寻求亲密, 以减轻痛苦并保护自己免受威胁(Bowlby, 1969/1982, 1973)。个体最终表现出的依恋特征是由个体内部工作模式和当前情境特征共同决定的(Fraley, 2007; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016a)。个体内部工作模式具有相对稳定性, 但其所处的情境(如是否存在危险, 依恋对象是否在身边等)则是时刻变化的, 这决定了个体依恋在不同情境下既会表现出某些共同特征, 也会表现出情境特异性特征。

应注意, 尽管状态性依恋和纵向研究中的依恋可变性都强调“变化”, 但两者不可混为一谈。前者所强调的变化是指在某一具体情境中依恋特征的暂时性改变; 而后者则是指特质性依恋在较长时期内是可以变化的。从个体发展历程的角度看, 在一段时间内个体依恋模式具有相对稳定性, 而个体发展, 生活环境变化、新的依恋关系形成等均会在一定程度上改变个体原有的依恋模式(Feeney, 2016; Fraley, 2007)。这与Piaget (1954)提出的同化和顺应观点一致, 个体在与环境的交互中, 通过同化过程, 个体依恋模式得以保持相对稳定, 而通过顺应过程, 个体依恋模式又会发生变化, 同化和顺应过程交互作用塑造了个体的依恋模式。尽管传统依恋理论认为在发展过程中个体依恋模式具有相对稳定性(Fraley & Roisman, 2019), 但纵向研究发现儿童养育环境与其成年后的依恋模式平均相关效应值约为0.15 (Fraley, Roisman, Booth-LaForce, Owen, & Holland, 2013; Chopik, Moors, & Edelstein, 2014)。再者, 发展时期也是影响依恋稳定性的因素之一, 依恋模式发展的社会化-选择不对称模型(socialization- selection asymmetries)认为儿童依恋模式会表现出更高的变化性, 而成人则表现出更高的稳定性。

总之, 在个体发展过程中特质性依恋是可变的, 而在较短时间内个体依恋既会表现出相对稳定的特征也会表现出情境特异性特征。个体依恋模式的二重性体现了依恋在人类进化过程中的适应意义, 即为适应不断变化的环境, 个体依恋相关心理和行为需取得稳定性和情境敏感性的动态平衡。

尽管Bowlby (1969/1982)在依恋理论建构时就提出, 个体依恋行为具有情境敏感性, 但受研究方法的限制, 传统研究工具大多旨在测量个体的特质性依恋, 如陌生情境测验、Q分类法和故事完成测验等(Ainsworth et al., 1978; Bretherton et al., 1990; Waters & Deane, 1985), 并不能对状态性依恋及两者之间的关系进行研究。随着启动范式在依恋领域的应用, 研究者可以在同一任务中同时考察特质性依恋和状态性依恋的关系 (Birnbaum, Hirschberger, & Goldenberg, 2011; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Hudson & Fraley, 2018; Mikulincer, Hirschberger, Nachmias, & Gillath, 2001; Stupica, Brett, Woodhouse, & Cassidy, 2018)。研究者通常用依恋维度(依恋焦虑和依恋回避)和依恋类型反映特质性依恋, 用依恋启动效应反映状态性依恋或状态性依恋的结果。依恋启动效应按启动刺激效价可分为安全启动效应和不安全启动效应(Gabriel, Kawakami, Bartak, Kang, & Mann, 2010; Granqvist, Mikulincer, Gewirtz, & Shaver, 2012)。需要注意的是在启动条件下, 状态性依恋与依恋启动效应并不相同。在依恋启动范式中, (外源性和内源性)启动刺激会引起个体依恋特征的状态性改变, 而依恋特征的状态性改变可能影响与依恋并非直接相关的认知加工和行为, 如创造性问题解决、团体认同和抑郁症状等(Carnelley, Bejinaru, Otway, Baldwin, & Rowe, 2018; Mikulincer, Shaver, & Rom, 2011; Rosenthal et al., 2012)。启动刺激作用下, 个体表现出的不同于特质性依恋的、与依恋直接相关的信息加工过程和行为特征才属于状态性依恋。这种改变及由其引起的其他与依恋并非直接相关认知和行为的变化均属于依恋启动效应。这些与依恋并非直接相关的认知和行为的改变在一定程度上也可以反映个体状态性依恋, 因此个体依恋维度得分或依恋类型与依恋启动效应的交互作用为认识个体特质性依恋和状态性依恋的关系提供了窗口。

安全依恋启动通过向被试呈现与依恋相关的刺激(如依恋对象的名字或照片), 激活依恋安全基地(secure base)相关心理表征进而影响个体后续心理和行为反应。安全依恋启动效应与依恋焦虑存在不同的交互作用模式。有研究表明低焦虑个体更容易受安全依恋启动影响, 而高焦虑个体则不易受此影响。安全启动后低焦虑个体对共情记忆的通达性更高(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001), 情绪感受更积极(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018), 而在这些研究中均未发现安全启动对高焦虑个体的显著影响。但也有研究发现了与之相反的模式。安全启动可以增强高焦虑个体对依恋相关词汇的通达性(Gokce & Harma, 2018), 减少对创伤记忆的回忆(Bryant & Foord, 2016), 降低对应激和消极情绪的易感性(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Schoemann, Gillath, & Sesko, 2012), 以及提高共情水平(Cassidy, Stern, Mikulincer, Martin, & Shaver, 2018)。同时, 在人际互动层面, 高焦虑个体在安全启动后更倾向于维持关系, 更少解除关系, 对社会联结强度和关系多重性的评分更高(Gillath, Karantzas, & Selcuk, 2017), 并更少使用自我责备(self-blame)分手策略(Collins & Gillath, 2012)。以上研究均未在低焦虑个体中发现安全启动效应。

与上述发现类似, 安全依恋启动效应与依恋回避间也存在不同的交互作用模式。有研究发现, 低回避个体更容易受安全依恋启动影响。在个体水平, 对于低回避个体, 安全启动会提高其共情记忆的通达性 (Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001), 减少创伤记忆闯入(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Bryant & Foord, 2016), 增强情绪体验的积极性并降低压力易感性(Bryant & Bali, 2018; Bryant & Chan, 2017; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Schoemann et al., 2012)。在人际互动水平, 安全启动后, 低回避个体更倾向于寻求物质支持和精神支持(Gillath et al., 2006), 维持网络社交关系(Gillath et al., 2017)。但也有研究发现了相反的模式, 即高回避个体更容易受安全依恋启动效应影响。安全启动会降低高回避个体从遗憾中习得教训的感觉(Schoemann et al., 2012), 降低解除关系的倾向(Gillath et al., 2017), 降低其使用回避/退缩分手策略的倾向(Collins & Gillath, 2012), 并提高对他人需要的反应性(Mikulincer, Shaver, Sahdra, & Bar-On, 2013)。

此外, 安全依恋启动对依恋焦虑和依恋回避得分的影响也不同, 研究采用重复启动范式发现, 安全启动会降低个体焦虑维度得分, 而对回避维度得分无影响(Hudson & Fraley, 2018)。研究者还探究了依恋类型与安全依恋启动的交互作用。研究发现焦虑型个体更容易从安全启动中获益, 如安全启动后焦虑型个体对痛苦强度的评分更低(Pan, Zhang, Liu, Ran, & Teng, 2017), 更多向他人寻求安慰(Evraire, Ludmer, & Dozois, 2014), 而对其他不安全依恋类型个体甚至会产生消极影响, 如安全启动会提高恐惧型个体对痛苦强度的评分(Pan et al., 2017), 减少回避型个体向他人寻求安慰的倾向(Evraire et al., 2014)。此外, 其他因素也会调节两者间的交互作用, 如在非压力条件下, 安全启动可以提高恐惧型个体对抽象材料的喜爱程度, 而在威胁情境下, 则对其无显著影响(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001)。

不安全依恋启动可分为依恋威胁启动、依恋焦虑启动和依恋回避启动。威胁启动通过向被试呈现与依恋相关的威胁刺激(如分离相关图片、记忆等)影响个体依恋系统(Gabriel et al., 2010; Marks & Vicary, 2016; Rosenthal et al., 2012)。威胁刺激并未直接激活某一具体的依恋图式, 而是使依恋系统处于激活状态(Bretherton, 1985), 随后个体长期通达性最高的依恋表征或图式将被激活, 被激活图式或表征将驱动接下来的加工过程。依恋焦虑启动和回避启动则旨在激活与依恋焦虑和依恋回避相关的图式, 进而暂时改变个体当前依恋状态(Boag & Carnelley, 2016; Jarvinen & Paulus, 2017; Melen, Pepping, & O'Donovan, 2017)。

威胁启动效应与依恋焦虑和依恋回避之间均存在不同的交互作用模式。对于威胁启动效应与依恋焦虑的关系, 有研究发现, 威胁启动会影响低焦虑个体而不会影响高焦虑个体, 如威胁启动会降低低焦虑个体对浪漫性爱的渴望, 而对高焦虑个体的影响不显著(Birnbaum et al., 2011)。但也有研究发现, 威胁启动会影响高焦虑个体, 而对低焦虑个体则无影响, 如威胁启动会降低高焦虑个体对距离相关词汇的通达性(Marks & Vicary, 2016), 对抽象材料评分的积极程度(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001), 而在低焦虑个体中则无显著效应。对于威胁启动效应与依恋回避的关系, 有研究发现威胁启动会影响低回避个体而不会影响高回避个体, 如威胁启动会提高低回避个体对依恋对象名字的通达性(Mikulincer, Gillath, & Shaver, 2002), 而高回避个体则不然。也有研究发现了与之相反的模式, 威胁启动下男性回避水平越高其对伴侣照片的注意广度越大, 注意越不集中(Dewitte & Koster, 2014), 同时, 威胁启动会降低高回避女性的性欲望, 提高高回避男性的性欲望(Birnbaum et al., 2011), 而对低回避个体无影响。此外, 目标任务性质也会影响威胁启动与依恋回避之间的交互作用, 如个体对不同词汇的反应任务中, 威胁启动后回避水平越高个体对依恋对象相关词汇的通达性越低, 而对中性词和非词, 则不存在交互作用(Granqvist et al., 2012)。

除依恋维度外, 研究者还考察了威胁启动效应与依恋类型的交互作用, 但相关研究较少。研究发现在威胁启动条件下, 安全型个体反应更加开放和激进, 而不安全个体则更加保守, 如威胁启动后安全型个体更倾向于支持自由派候选人, 而不安全个体更倾向于支持保守派候选人(Weise et al., 2008)。此外, 目标任务性质和个体状态等会影响两者间的交互作用。对于目标任务性质, 在威胁启动条件下, 安全型、回避型和焦虑型个体对依恋相关词汇的通达性无差异; 而对于心理距离词汇, 焦虑型和安全型个体显著高于回避型个体。认知负荷也会影响两者的交互作用, 在低认知负荷条件下, 回避型个体对心理词汇的反应与安全型类似, 而在高认知负荷条件下, 回避型与焦虑型个体的反应均快于安全型个体(Mikulincer, Birnbaum, Woddis, & Nachmias, 2000)。

在不安全启动研究中, 对依恋焦虑启动与依恋回避启动与特质性依恋之间交互作用的研究相对较少, 但研究发现焦虑依恋启动与特质性依恋, 特别是与依恋焦虑存在交互作用。研究发现, 焦虑启动会提高低焦虑个体的进食量, 而对高焦虑个体无显著影响(Wilkinson, Rowe, & Heath, 2013)。再者, 依恋焦虑启动会降低高焦虑男性对亲密的渴望, 并使其在性幻想中的自我和他人表征更加消极(Birnbaum, Simpson, Weisberg, Barnea, & Assulin-Simhon, 2012)。值得注意的是, 有研究发现重复焦虑启动会降低高焦虑个体的焦虑水平(Hudson & Fraley, 2018)。这可能是因为该研究中焦虑启动采用了回忆叙事范式, 对消极关系的反思可能帮助焦虑个体修通其与亲密关系相关的负性信念和预期(Fredrickson, Cohn, Coffey, Pek, & Finkel, 2008)。此外, 焦虑启动可能会使回避型个体采用的抑制激活策略失效, 研究发现, 焦虑启动会提高高回避个体在共情情境下体验到的个人压力(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001), 这可能是因为回忆范式下要求回忆与亲密关系相关的消极记忆构成了额外威胁, 损害了其回避策略的使用(Mikulincer & Florian, 2001)。

尽管上述研究均稳健地表明, 特质性依恋与依恋启动引发的状态性依恋之间存在交互作用, 但也有许多研究表明无论在个体层面还是人际层面, 依恋二重特征的效应彼此独立, 即依恋启动效应独立于个体特质性依恋。在个体层面, 研究发现个体对威胁刺激的反应, 无论以心率、皮肤电活动还是以表情为指标, 安全依恋启动与依恋焦虑和回避维度均不存在交互作用(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Stupica et al., 2018), 且安全启动对反应抑制和挫折引起的情绪反应的影响也独立于依恋两维度(Karreman, Vingerhoets, & Bekker, 2019; Li et al., 2016)。同时, 安全依恋启动后, 个体在自传记忆回忆连贯性、具体性, 消极记忆闯入, 积极情绪通达性, 对挫折的情绪反应, 负性情绪管理中的表现均不受依恋维度的影响(Bryant & Bali, 2018; Bryant & Foord, 2016; Clear & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2017; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001)。而在人际互动层面也得到了一致结果, 关于浪漫嫉妒、网络攻击行为、偏见、人际应激、人格化策略、共情、帮助寻求和为他人提供帮助和支持等的研究均发现启动效应独立于个体特质性依恋(Bartz, Tchalova, & Fenerci, 2016; Gillath et al., 2006; Liu, Huo, Chen, & Song, 2018; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer et al., 2013; Pardess, Mikulincer, Dekel, & Shaver, 2014; Saleem et al., 2015; Selterman & Maier, 2013)。如对于他人需要的共情反应, 安全启动效应和特质性依恋分别独立挥发作用, 安全启动会增加个体在共情情境中自我报告的共情反应, 而依恋焦虑和回避会降低共情反应, 且两者之间不存在交互作用(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001)。

除安全启动的研究外, 不安全启动研究也发现特质性依恋与状态性依恋之间不存在交互作用。研究发现威胁启动会提高对依恋对象名字的通达性, 如母亲和离世的亲人, 且该效应独立于依恋焦虑和依恋回避(Carr & Landau, 2012; Mancini & Bonanno, 2012; Mikulincer et al., 2002)。再者, 压力启动会提高个体对亲近相关观念的通达性(Mikulincer et al., 2000)。此外, 关于个体对与上帝相关观念的认知开放性, 研究发现依恋焦虑启动、回避启动和安全启动与依恋回避和焦虑无交互作用(Jarvinen & Paulus, 2017)。可见, 无论安全依恋启动还是不安全依恋启动条件下均有研究发现依恋二重特征间不存在交互作用。

实证研究表明特质性依恋和依恋启动效应之间的关系模式十分复杂, 甚至存在方向相反的交互作用模式, 仅仅将这些不一致结果归因为误差显然并不合适。如何厘清这些复杂的结果, 并用同一理论框架进行解释, 有助于研究者对依恋二重特征的性质、功能及其之间的关系有更清晰、深入的认识。传统依恋理论主要包括两部分：(1)规范部分(normative aspect), 该部分主要是关于依恋系统及其发展的常态和普遍特征; (2)个体差异部分, 该部分主要是关于依恋系统运作的个体差异(Bowlby, 1969/1982)。与之对应, Mikulincer和Shaver (2016a)为解释情境刺激对个体依恋心理和行为的影响提出了依恋系统激活两阶段模型, 该模型为整合和解释上述复杂的交互作用模式提供了框架。

Mikulincer和Shaver (2016a)认为, 一旦个体评估发现情境中存在威胁, 依恋系统就会被自动激活, 该激活过程包括两个阶段。第一阶段, 威胁评估将导致依恋系统的潜意识激活, 并自动化地增强对依恋相关表征、想法和行为倾向的通达性。依恋系统激活的第一阶段与传统依恋理论中规范部分相对应, 该部分的核心观点是个体在感受到威胁时, 无论个体特质性依恋特征如何, 依恋系统均会被激活(Bowlby, 1969/1982)。不安全启动研究为该观点提供了证据, 研究发现在威胁启动或依恋焦虑和依恋回避启动条件下, 个体对依恋对象和亲近相关表征的通达性提高, 且该效应独立于依恋焦虑和回避维度得分(Carr & Landau, 2012; Jarvinen & Paulus, 2017)。既然依恋系统激活第一阶段的结果是激活依恋和亲密相关依恋表征, 提高其通达性, 那么直接激活这些依恋相关表征也应产生类似的效果。研究发现安全启动刺激会提高依恋相关表征的通达性 (Bryant & Bali, 2018), 抑制负性表征和负性情绪的激活, 提高情绪的积极性(Bryant & Foord, 2016; Clear & Zimmer- Gembeck, 2017)。这些被激活的积极表征和情绪将主导个体当前的心智状态, 使个体以更加积极、灵活和开放的方式应对威胁 (Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Stupica et al., 2018), 进行人际互动(Bartz et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Pardess et al., 2014; Saleem et al., 2015; Selterman & Maier, 2013)。无论是威胁刺激激活依恋系统, 提高亲密等依恋表征的通达性, 还是直接激活依恋安全相关表征, 两种方式均能对个体后续的心理和行为产生影响。尽管依恋理论的规范部分认为无论个体依恋特征如何, 个体在感知到威胁时依恋系统均会被自动激活, 但个体对情境刺激的评估可能受个体特质性依恋的影响, 所以Mikulicner和Shaver (2016a)认为该阶段依恋系统激活受过度激活和抑制激活依恋策略相关的兴奋性和抑制性环路影响。该观点也得到了实证研究的支持, 如威胁启动会提高低回避个体对依恋对象名字的通达性, 而对高回避个体无影响(Mikulincer et al., 2002), 还有研究发现, 威胁启动会降低高焦虑个体积极情绪激活, 而对低焦虑个体无影响(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001); 类似地, 研究发现安全启动可以提高低焦虑和低回避个体共情记忆的通达性, 而对高焦虑和高回避个体无影响(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001)。

第二阶段, 依恋相关心理表征的潜意识激活可以塑造个体当前的心理状态, 甚至在个体意识到之前影响个体的行为计划(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016), 并且这些被激活表征将唤起有意识的、与亲密寻求相关的想法, 主导个体接下来的活动, 并在很多情况下转化为寻求亲密和保护的可见行为。在该阶段个体基于依恋经验形成的特质性依恋将发挥更大作用, 换句话说, 该阶段依恋个体差异将表现得更加明显。特质性依恋与依恋启动效应表现出不同交互作用模式可能与具有不同特质性依恋特征个体偏好的依恋表征和策略有关。依恋安全个体(低焦虑和低回避)通常采用安全基地策略, 并表现出积极的信息加工和人际互动, 而高焦虑和高回避个体则分别偏好过度激活策略和抑制激活策略, 表现出消极的信息加工和人际互动(Dykas & Cassidy, 2011)。

依恋焦虑反映了个体在需要时重要他人可得的程度以及害怕被拒绝和抛弃的程度(Moura- Ramos, Santos, & Canavaro, 2017)。高焦虑个体通常使用过度激活策略, 表现为长期对依恋信息保持高度警觉, 并伴随强烈的忧虑且努力、强迫性地获得依恋对象的爱和支持(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016b)。无论个体依恋焦虑水平如何, 安全启动均可提高个体依恋基地相关表征和情绪通达性(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Gokce & Harma, 2018; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001)。但高焦虑个体依恋表征通达性通常处于较高水平, 故低焦虑个体相对高焦虑个体更容易表现出安全启动效应。再者, 安全启动条件下个体安全基地相关表征激活水平提高, 高焦虑个体将体验到更强的依恋安全感, 进而使其之后的认知和行为表现更加积极(Bryant & Foord, 2016; Cassidy et al., 2018; Schoemann et al., 2012)。而低焦虑个体依恋安全水平相对较高, 安全启动对其影响更小, 所以在这种情况下高焦虑个体更容易出现安全依恋启动效应。研究发现安全启动在高焦虑个体中会产生两种不同结果：(1)安全启动能够给高焦虑个体带来积极效应, 使其无论在信息加工还是人际互动中的表现更加积极、具有适应性(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Cassidy et al., 2018; Gillath et al., 2017; Gokce & Harma, 2018); (2)安全启动并不影响高焦虑个体的表现(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer et al., 2011)。产生以上两种不同结果可能是因为焦虑型个体的依恋表征网络内既包括与依恋安全、亲密相关的积极表征, 也包括不安全依恋相关的消极表征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007)。因此, 若安全启动刺激激活积极表征, 则会产生安全启动效应, 若安全启动刺激让被试联想到消极经验, 激活消极表征, 则个体不会表现出安全启动效应, 甚至产生消极影响(Mallinckrodt et al., 2013)。在不安全依恋启动, 特别是威胁启动条件下, 高焦虑个体感受到更高的不安全感, 此时个体将采用防御性策略应对威胁, 进而使得之后的认知和行为更加消极, 如情绪体验更加消极(Mikulincer, Hirschberger et al., 2001)。而低焦虑个体安全水平较高, 能够更加积极地应对威胁(Rosenthal et al., 2012), 更少表现出不适应性行为(Birnbaum et al., 2011)。值得注意的是, Hudson和Fraley (2018)研究发现重复焦虑启动会降低高焦虑个体的焦虑水平。这可能是因为研究采用回忆叙事范式, 对消极关系的反思可能帮助焦虑个体修通其与亲密关系相关的负性信念和预期(Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991; Fredrickson et al., 2008)。由此可推断, 在阈上条件下依恋不安全启动的效应在很大程度上取决于个体对启动刺激的主观评估, 这与Mikulincer和Shaver (2016)的观点一致。

依恋回避反映了个体努力维持行为独立及与重要他人维持情绪距离的程度(Moura-Ramos et al., 2017), 高回避个体倾向于使用抑制激活策略, 通过抑制依恋系统激活避免可能产生的痛苦(Dykas & Cassidy, 2011; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016)。当安全启动效应体现为提高个体依恋相关的认知和行为表现时, 低回避个体更容易表现出安全启动效应。低回避个体依恋安全感较高, 在安全启动条件下能够以更开放、积极的方式应对威胁、进行信息加工和人际互动(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Bryant & Foord, 2016; Gillath et al., 2017; Gillath et al., 2006; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer et al., 2011)。而高回避个体在面对威胁时, 通常采用抑制激活策略, 抑制对依恋相关刺激的通达性(Dewitte & Koster, 2014; Granqvist et al., 2012), 因此更不容易表现出安全启动效应。当安全启动效应体现为降低个体依恋相关消极行为时, 高回避更容易表现出安全启动效应(Collins & Gillath, 2012; Gillath et al., 2017; Mikulincer et al., 2013)。这可能是因为低回避个体通常能以积极的方式进行依恋相关的信息加工和人际互动, 消极行为相对较少, 因而更不容表现出安全启动效应。应注意, 高回避个体面对的“威胁”是经个体主观评价的结果, 即使客观刺激性质是安全的, 但若个体将其评价为威胁的, 也将驱使其采用抑制激活策略(Evraire et al., 2014)。但抑制激活策略并非在任何情境下均有效, 当该策略需要的认知资源被占用时就会失效, 研究表明该策略在低认知负荷下有效, 而在高认知负荷下则会失效(Mikulincer et al., 2000)。

综上, 安全启动效应主要体现在两个方面, 提高安全依恋个体依恋相关的适应性心理和行为表现, 降低不安全个体与依恋相关的消极认知和行为表现。而对于威胁启动, 依恋安全个体通常可以有效应对威胁刺激, 而高焦虑和高回避个体分别倾向于采用过度激活和抑制激活策略应对威胁。个体特质性依恋特征及启动刺激引起的状态性依恋特征共同影响了个体在具体情境中的表现。

个体在某一情境中表现出的依恋心理和行为是特质性依恋与情境引发状态性依恋相互作用、共同决定的。个体依恋模式处于稳定性与变化性之间张力的平衡中。依恋特征的二重性既保证了个体的同一性, 也使个体对环境的反应具有适应性。特质性依恋与依恋启动效应的多种交互作用模式为理解依恋二重性提供了实证证据, 依恋系统激活两阶段模型为理解、整合这些结果提供了框架。但在该领域仍然存在许多分歧和不足, 需要未来进一步研究。

当前采用依恋启动范式对于依恋二重性关系的研究存在的一个问题是大部分依恋启动研究未提供操作检验, 在这种情况下研究者更多通过结果事后推测依恋启动的有效性, 但并未提供直接证据证明依恋启动的有效性。这是因为操作检验可能引起被试对实验目的的猜测或降低本来就较弱的启动效应, 进而影响实验结果(Birnbaum et al., 2012)。Birnbaum等(2012)在研究中额外招募了一组被试只用于启动有效性的检验, 他们要求被试在启动完成后评价自己害怕被抛弃的程度, 结果表明焦虑启动组评分显著高于安全启动组。Schoemann等(2012)通过对被试在依恋想象启动任务中想象内容进行编码和分析确保被试进行了相应的想象, 但他们也未直接检验启动效应。Deng等(2016)通过实验组与控制组在完成启动任务后对当下感到安全、温暖、支持和想要给别人拥抱的程度的评分检验安全激活程度; 而Pan等(2017)通过启动前后的状态依恋问卷得分比较检验了启动效应。上述方法只可用于阈上依恋启动效应的操作检验, 不适用于阈下启动方法的检验。将来研究者应进一步优化阈上启动效应的检验方法, 同时发展适用于阈下启动效应的检验方法。

当前关于依恋二重性关系的研究多采用依恋焦虑和依恋回避两维度得分作为个体特质性依恋的指标。研究之所以多采用依恋维度描述个体特质性依恋是因其在某些方面更具优势(Fraley et al., 2015)。但当前依恋研究很多研究常分别对焦虑和回避进行单独分析, 而未考虑两者之间的交互作用(Gillath et al., 2015; Marks & Vicary, 2016; Mikulincer et al., 2014)。但有研究发现在依恋启动、依恋焦虑和依恋回避之间存在三者交互作用, 如Pan等(2017)发现对焦虑维度得分较高者, 若其回避维度得分高于一个标准差, 则安全依恋启动会降低其对痛苦图片的评分, 若其回避维度得分低于一个标准差则会提高其评分; 而低焦虑得分个体无论其回避维度得分如何, 均未发现启动效应。Schoemann等(2012)也发现了安全依恋启动与焦虑和回避间的三者交互作用, 安全启动可以降低高焦虑-低回避个体的遗憾感, 而对其他被试无显著影响; 同时安全依恋启动可以提高高焦虑-高回避个体通过错误学习的感觉, 而降低低焦虑-高回避个体通过错误学习的感觉, 并对其他类型的被试无显著影响。将来依恋启动研究中采用依恋维度测量个体特质性依恋时, 应考虑两维度间的交互作用。

目前研究中高焦虑与依恋启动效应存在不同的作用模式。有研究发现不安全启动会给高焦虑个体带来负面影响, 如降低情绪积极性和对同伴团体的认同等(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001; Rosenthal et al., 2012), 增加高焦虑个体的消极情绪体验(Mallinckrodt et al., 2013), 有研究

则表明高焦虑个体不受不安全启动的影响(Birnbaum et al., 2011), 甚至Hudson和Fraley (2018)发现重复焦虑启动会降低高焦虑个体的焦虑水平。这些不一致结果可能与焦虑型个体依恋表征的复杂性有关。焦虑个体的依恋表征可能是双效价的, 既有积极表征, 也有消极表征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007)。激活不同表征可能会产生不同结果, 将来研究应关注焦虑个体依恋表征的双效价性, 采用更具针对性的启动材料, 进一步揭示高焦虑与依恋启动效应产生不同作用模式的原因。

根据依恋系统激活的两阶段模型, 从激活依恋系统的刺激呈现至个体做出反应存在两个过程(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016)。第一阶段更多是自动化的, 而第二阶段个体特质性依恋将发挥更大作用。回避型个体倾向于采用抑制策略而焦虑型个体通常采用过度激活策略, 但这些依恋应对策略在信息加工中何时发挥作用仍不清晰。依恋策略是在个体对刺激进行评估时发挥作用, 还是在评估后做出反应时才发挥作用?未来研究应从信息加工时间进程角度对该问题进一步研究。此外, 依恋策略发挥作用是否需要意识参与也值得关注。研究发现阈下启动在创造性问题解决表现中, 启动效应独立于个体依恋特质性, 而在阈上启动条件下, 低焦虑个体表现出更高的创造性问题解决行为, 而对高焦虑个体无影响(Mikulincer et al., 2011), 这似乎说明个体意识参与是高焦虑个体的依恋策略发挥效用的条件, 这一问题也值得将来研究进一步关注。

# 依恋理论与心智化 - 心理学空间

依恋理论与心智化

依恋理论/依附理论 Attachment Theory　　依恋，一般被定义为婴儿和他的照顾者（一般为母亲）之间存在的一种特殊的感情关系。它产生于婴儿与其父母的相互作用过程中，是一种感情上的联结和纽带[1]。 　　依恋是小孩为了适应人际环境而发展出来的防御性安全策略。依恋的工作模式是一个重要的短期生存/应对策略。是心智化发展过程中的重要建筑单元。

# “渴望爱，却充满回避和焦虑” | 恐惧型依恋者的6个迹象_ta_关系_行为


                        由内容质量、互动评论、分享传播等多维度分值决定，勋章级别越高(
                        
                        )，代表其在平台内的综合表现越好。
                    

你身边是否存在这样一种人：

ta渴望亲密，希望能接近潜在的依恋对象（朋友/伴侣），但当那些人靠得太近，ta们会变得非常不舒服，并渴望退出这段关系。

然而，觉察到对方离开，ta又变得焦虑，肝肠寸断。

因此，ta传达给别人的信息其实是：“我喜欢你，但你离我远点”。 

虽然这一类型在人群中的占比较小（约6%），但ta们往往具有最糟糕的情感体验和人际关系。

一些工作模型表明，恐惧型依恋更可能陷入虐待关系，与较高的边缘人格障碍、解离症状、孤独、抑郁风险相关。

恐惧型依恋者常具有如下【6个特征】：

1）情绪和行为不稳定且不可预测

当一个人处于“恐惧型”的状态下，ta既担心被抛弃，又对亲密感到不适。

换句话说，ta们没有“对亲密的应对方式”——ta想接近的潜在亲密对象，也是ta害怕接近的人。在关系中，这种行为常引起误会，让人迷惑不解。

2）对重要他人的“理想化”和“愤怒”

研究表明，恐惧依恋的成年人会防御性地组织行为，对重要他人出现“理想化（要求一个完美的伴侣）”和“愤怒”的交替情绪，以尽量减少被拒绝的痛苦。

比如为了不被拒绝，宁愿孤独地过日子。努力减少与他人的情感接触，同时又要延续关系。



3）拥有极度情绪化的关系

在情绪调节方面，恐惧依恋者往往比其他不安全类型的人更麻烦）。

比如，很难从愤怒中平静下来，或容易感到强烈的“被排斥感”……无法应对情绪上的“压倒性来袭”时，可能会做出一些破坏人际关系的行为。

4）ta可能有很多的性伴侣

☞ 一项跟踪600人近40年的研究发现，“恐惧依恋”可以预测个人一生中更多的性伴侣数量，以及更大的性依从性（sexual compliance，即遵从伴侣的性欲望）。对男女来说都是如此。

因为ta们渴望爱，却害怕亲密，而偶然的性关系可以让ta们置于这种处境：

性活动既增加了亲密度，逃离可能导致抑郁的想法，也让ta们在感情上保持距离。

5）ta们更易出现攻击和控制行为

相对其他不安全的依恋类型，恐惧依恋的男性更容易对女性产生敌意、配偶虐待和儿童性虐待。

6）缺乏自尊，有强烈的拒绝恐惧

从性别维度看，女性比男性更容易产生恐惧依恋。在女性样本中，恐惧依恋者具有“低自尊、沮丧和强烈的注意力需要”。

她们的共同点是，对他人有深深的不信任，不愿意寻求专业帮助。这可能与她们负面的自我看法和强烈的拒绝恐惧有关。

心理学博士Hal Shorey认为，恐惧依恋的成人，一般在童年时期有过至少一名养育者出现过“可怕的养育行为”。

这会在孩子体内产生一种对自身安全的恐惧——孩子下意识地觉察到，照顾者不能满足自己的需要。

然而，父母并不一定具备主观敌意。有精神疾病的家长也同样会让孩子感到害怕——因为孩子知道父母没有能力保护自己。

从神经生物学观点看，一些具有恐惧依恋对象的儿童，甚至可能无法全面发展出整合性的神经结构，导致成年后的情绪失调问题。

换句话说，孩子生来依恋父母，却不能将依恋者视为“安全基地”。

在以后的生活中，ta们会创造出一个想要亲密的人，但同时也会创造出一个害怕亲密的人。



1）克服对安全感的恐惧，寻求一段安全的关系

比如谈恋爱，大约50%的成年人拥有安全型依恋模式，几率其实还不错。

在新的关系中，你可以挑战自己的防御能力，并努力在这种关系中发展自己。

或者去见心理咨询师。心理咨询师会成为关系中的“安全基地”，与来访者重新建立一种新的、可靠的、具有接纳性的依恋关系，整合创伤，促进个人资源的整合。

2）为自己的经历写一个连贯的故事

依恋研究表明，儿童依恋类型的最佳预测因素并不是“父母经历了何种创伤”，而是“父母如何理解、解决这些创伤”。

对于未解决的创伤，一个很关键的做法是为自己创建连贯叙述的过程。重新讲述自己的故事本身，就可以“增强”安全感和个人心理弹性。

3）放下受害者模式，每个人都应为自己的选择负责

这个话题，算是老生常谈了。在亲密关系里，对对方总是不满意，但还选择关系继续的，那定是这段关系还有继续的价值。

归根结底，放弃还是继续，这是你权衡之后做出的一个选择。每个人都应为自己的选择负责。

如果你总觉得这个选择是被迫的，无奈的，只能两害相权取其轻，但又让自己陷入纠结、矛盾、焦虑或者抑郁之中，那你就要重新审视一下：这个选择对吗？我有能力去做出改变吗？

如果你自己没有答案，那这恰恰是你需要成长的一个点，你如果凭一己之力无法穿越，请及时求助专业的心理咨询师帮助。

你要清楚一点：我自身的问题，需要我自己去面对、去解决。

绝对不是“如果对方怎样怎样，我才能怎样怎样”，这种不合理的信念需要被打破，跳出受害者模式，你才可能做自己幸福的主宰。返回搜狐，查看更多

摘要： 传统依恋理论认为个体依恋心理和行为模式具有相对稳定性, 但无论在信息加工还是个体发展过程中, 个体依恋模式均表现出二重性, 即既具有相对稳定性, 又具有情境敏感性。个体在情境中所表现出的依恋模式是个体相对稳定的特质性依恋和情境特征相互作用的结果。依恋启动研究中特质性依恋特征与依恋启动效应之间的交互作用模式为理解依恋二重特征及其关系提供了窗口。依恋系统激活的两阶段模型为整合和解释这些相互作用模式提供了框架。未来研究应优化依恋二重特征关系研究中启动效应的操作检验, 考虑依恋焦虑和回避维度的交互作用, 关注高焦虑群体内的依恋差异, 以理析依恋二重特征之间的相互作用方式, 同时关注依恋策略影响依恋启动效应的时间进程, 探究依恋二重特征相互作用的机制。

Abstract: Traditional attachment theory suggests that an individual’s attachment-related psychological and behavioral patterns are relatively stable. However, from information processes or life-span development perspective, attachment patterns have trait-state duality, i.e. attachment patterns are both relatively stable and context-sensitive. An individual’s attachment pattern in a particular context is the consequence of his or her trait attachment and contextual feature interactions. The interaction patterns between trait attachment and attachment priming effects provide a window to understand the duality of attachment and their relationships. And the two-stages model of attachment activation offers a framework for integrating and understanding these patterns. Future studies should optimize the manipulation check of attachment priming, meanwhile, take the interaction between attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety in consideration. More attention should be paid to the individual differences in the high attachment anxiety group which may clarify the patterns of interaction between trait and state attachment. Moreover, the time course of how attachment coping strategies impact the effects of attachment priming should be concerned, which could reveal the mechanism of the interactions between trait and state attachment.

# 亲密关系中的识别情绪模式 | 你是哪种“依恋类型”？ • 6秒钟情商官网

 由 Huang, Chamie | 7 月 3, 2020 | 6秒钟, 生活情商 | 0 条评论

每个人都有一些“好模式”和“坏模式”，如果我们不想一次又一次地重复同样的错误，首先要做的就是意识到“问题出在哪里”。本篇文章帮助我们探索自己在亲密关系中的模式，并了解这些模式是如何影响着我们建立和打破关系。

伴侣之间有时会发生争吵，虽然这种场景不常发生，但每一次都很伤人。

妻子回家发现家里有几处衣服，于是抱怨了一句：“你为什么每次都把衣服乱扔！？”，两个人开始为此进行对话，在你一言我一语的过程中，和“反抗”相关的模式被激活，为了证明自己才是对的那一个，对话升级为争吵。

丈夫可能因此被压得喘不过气来，需要独处才能回到安全和爱的状态。妻子可能因此委屈地哭泣，继续不断地诉说，需要一个肯定回应才能安定心神。

依恋类型 Attachment Style

“依恋类型”这个概念最早是由英国精神病学家鲍尔比(John Bowlby，1969)提出的，他将依恋定义为“个体与具有特殊意义的他人形成牢固的情感纽带的倾向，能为个体提供安全和安慰”。

鲍尔比最早提出依恋这个概念主要是用来解释婴儿与其养护者之间的情感联系，但后来的研究者们将之扩展到了成人之间。

现在依恋(Attachment)主要指：个体与主要抚养者发展出的一种特殊的、积极的情感纽带，也是指个体寻求并企图与另一个体在身体和情感上保持亲密联系的倾向。

阅读以下描述，看看你属于三种类型中的哪种依恋类型？

◈ 焦虑（对抗）型 Anxious-resistant

你需要从伴侣那里得到许多关注才能感觉到被爱。你经常会有一种“距离感”，你可能讨厌带着愤怒说晚安，你需要先解决争吵，才能再次感到“完整”。可能表现的比较“黏人”或“需要帮助”。

◈ 安全型 Secure

你乐于给予和接受关注，与对方距离太远或太近时，你都意识到，然后会要求更多的空间或更多的关注来让自己感到舒服。你认定的事情不会因他人的行为而受到影响。

◈ 回避型 Avoidant

你非常重视独立和个人空间，可能不太愿意给予或接受感情。当一段感情开始后，你很快就会意识到这需要你放弃独立，所以可能难长时间维持一段感情。你可能会听到他人评价你有些自私或冷漠。

在这些描述中，你认出自己和伴侣了吗？每个依恋类型都会有相似的一些“模式”，而在亲密关系中，每个人也可以通过脱离自动驾驶模式，有意识地选择或改变自己的模式，来更好的支持彼此。

接下来，一起看一些故事和例子吧。

 

焦虑对抗型 vs 回避型 

在争论期间，回避型Andy想要独处的空间，而焦虑对抗型Judy却想要在一起。花了一段时间，他们终于认识到双方的不同模式。当Andy发现自己不知所措时，他想找到最近的出口，独处一段时间。而Judy感到难过时，希望自己可以更多的被关注和照顾。Andy和Judy共同讨论两人的模式，并运用同理心去理解对方的观点，他们商量出一个共同的策略。

当他们吵架时，Andy会有一段自己的时间，可以是30分钟，3个小时，一天……但需要事先告知Judy。时间到了后，Andy会充满能量的回来。而Judy知道了Andy的独处时间是多久，她会因此感到安全。在这段时间里，她能够专注于自己，比如与家人聊天、和朋友逛街等。Judy也会轻轻地提醒Andy，他们有一个共同的约定。在这种情况下，他们两个互相满足了对方的需求。

回避型 vs 回避型 

Lucy和Peter都是回避型的依恋类型，很多时候他们都宁愿一个人呆着。尽管他们都非常重视稳定以及家人关系，但他们很容易忘记保持良好的关系需要一些情感上的工作。于是他们发现双方的模式后，共同讨论了一个策略。

他们每周安排一次时间，以情侣的身份进行连接。他们共同撰写了一份文件，表达对方自己有多重要，在争论之后回看这份文件。除此之外，他们优先考虑各自的独处时间，有时也会利用这个时间来表达对彼此的爱。Lucy会为Peter写爱情日记，而Peter则会用心为Lucy挑选礼物。为了避免自己忽略对方的需求和感受，他们还找到了可信赖的咨询师来支持他们。他们虽然都是回避型，但也可以通过一起学习，相互支持，来体会爱这样一件美好、安全的事情。

焦虑对抗型 vs 焦虑对抗型 

John和Jane都是焦虑对抗型，平时他们甜蜜得似胶如漆，彼此间充满爱意。于是在争执时，他们都会希望得到对方的关注。但驾驭情绪对于同样是焦虑型的Jane和John，都很挑战，因此，为了更好地谈论和验证情绪，他们也共同制定了一个策略。

一旦有谁感到受伤，先准确地表达自己的感受，而不是使用置气、抱怨的方式进行交流，此时另一方需要表达爱、安全和谅解。这样不仅能共同满足彼此的需求，他们也体会到爱不一定是要每时每刻在一起，独处时也可以从自己的内心感受到爱与支持，并再稳定地给予对方。

不论是什么依恋类型，也不论是什么样的模式，建立长期幸福关系的技巧很简单：确保满足每个人的需求。识别情绪模式也不是为了改变，而是更有意识地选择更合适的回应。

那么，你在亲密关系中是属于哪种依恋类型？你的伴侣呢？针对你们相处的模式，可以共同制定什么样策略来让彼此的感情更为长久和稳定？

基于生命早期经验形成的依恋心理和行为模式具有相对稳定性, 会对个体生命全程的人际关系、人格发展等产生深远影响是依恋理论的核心假设之一(Raby & Dozier, 2019)。但实证研究对这一观点提出了挑战, 纵向研究表明早期依恋模式与之后不同时期依恋模式的相关性较低(Fraley & Roisman, 2019)。同时, 社会认知研究发现个体依恋相关心理和行为会受当前情境影响, 暂时表现出不同于个体长期占主导地位的依恋模式的特征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016a, 2016b)。可见, 个体依恋心理和行为模式既有相对稳定性, 也有情境敏感性。换句话说, 情境中个体的依恋心理和行为特征处于稳定性和情境引致变化性的张力中, 如同路边的树, 没有风的时候指向其经年累月形成的固定方向, 风吹来, 树的朝向则会随风而变, 风一停止, 则又恢复到原来的朝向。

社会认知范式为研究情境对依恋的影响以及个体依恋特征与情境的交互作用提供了有效工具和新证据, 但个体依恋特征具有二重性的观点也见于传统依恋研究文献中。研究者遵循Bowlby (1969/1982)以及Ainsworth, Bell和Stayton (1972)强调依恋个体差异的传统, 将个体依恋特征视为一种具有跨时空、跨情境稳定性的特质。受此研究思路的影响, 依恋类型的划分、稳定性及早期依恋经验对个体之后各领域发展的影响等问题一直是依恋研究的焦点。但Bowlby (1969/1982, 1973)在论述依恋特征具有相对稳定性的同时, 也强调个体依恋系统具有情境敏感性, 即个体依恋系统受情境因素的影响而被激活或终止激活。但由于研究方法的限制, 直至最近20年, 依恋稳定性与情境敏感性问题才得到系统研究。研究者借鉴社会认知领域的相关理论和研究范式, 开始关注依恋个体差异背后的认知加工过程, 证实了个体依恋相关心理和行为特征会因情境作用表现出不同于个体长期依恋模式的状态性特征(Fraley, 2007; Gillath, Hart, Noftle, & Stockdale, 2009)。同时, 个体较稳定的依恋特征与依恋相关情境特征共同决定了个体在某一依恋情境中最终的心理和行为表现(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016a)。

个体心理和行为模式的稳定性和变化性问题始终是人格、自我领域关注的重要问题(Conway, Singer, & Tagini, 2004)。理解个体依恋特征既具有相对稳定性又具有情境敏感性, 以及个体稳定性依恋特征如何与情境交互作用共同影响个体在某一具体情境中的依恋表现, 有助于加深人们对个体如何应对情境中依恋刺激的理解, 以及对依恋行为在进化中适应意义的认识。本文首先将讨论个体依恋二重特征的定义及其在信息加工和个体发展中的表现, 继而梳理依恋启动研究中特质性依恋与依恋启动效应的交互作用模式, 最后以依恋系统激活两阶段模型对这些交互作用模式进行整合和解释, 以期助益于将来相关研究的开展。

依恋特征是由与依恋相关的知识、情绪、认知加工和行为等构成的集群(constellation)或模式(Fraley & Roisman, 2019)。学者分别使用“特质性依恋(trait attachment)”和“状态性依恋(state attachment)” 描述个体在依恋相关情境中表现出来的相对稳定的心理和行为特征和因情境刺激变化而暂时表现出的不同于个体稳定特征的暂时性特征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2017)。潜在状态-特质理论认为, 个体的心理和行为取决于个体特征, 情境特征和个体与情境的交互作用。同时, 个体在具体情境中的心理和行为特征会随情境变化而变化, 从这个意义上讲, 个体在某一情境中表现出的心理和行为特征均是状态性的(Steyer, Schmitt, & Eid, 1999)。按该理论, 个体在具体情境中表现出的依恋特征均是状态性依恋, 且状态性依恋特征是由个体特质性依恋特征、情境特征以及两者的交互作用决定的。以下将在“个体-情境”框架下, 从信息加工的视角对特质性依恋和状态性依恋进行界定和说明。

特质性依恋是个体依恋特征中具有相对稳定性和跨时空一致性的特征, 它反映了个体较长时间内依恋特征的平均水平。个体会在长期依恋互动经验中形成相对稳定的依恋表征和图式, 其中占主导地位的依恋图式会影响个体在某一情境中的依恋心理和行为。特质性依恋有助于个体避免陷于无序和混乱中, 对保持自我同一性和连续性十分重要, 同时该类特征有助于人们对依恋相关心理和行为进行解释和预测。在传统依恋研究中, 研究者多使用依恋类型对个体依恋行为特征进行描述和组织, 如陌生情景测验、Q分类法、故事完成测验、成人依恋访谈、当前关系访谈 (Ainsworth et al., 1972; Ainsworth, Bell, & Stayton, 1971; Bretherton, Ridgeway, & Cassidy, 1990; Crowell & Owens, 1996; Hazan & Shaver, 1987; Waters & Deane, 1985), 研究发现使用依恋维度描述个体依恋特征可能比采用依恋类型更具优势(Fraley, Hundson, Heffernan, & Segal, 2015), 常用测量依恋维度的工具包括亲密关系经历问卷和父母与同伴依恋问卷等(Armsden & Greenberg, 1987; Brennan, Clark, & Shaver, 1998)。但无论类型法还是维度法, 均假设个体存在稳定的依恋模式, 依恋模式作为一种特质具有跨时间和跨情境一致性, 且存在个体差异。个体依恋类型或依恋维度旨在捕捉个体在较长时间内、在不同情境下均会表现出的依恋特征。

状态性依恋是个体特质性依恋与其所处具体情境共同作用所表现出来的心理和行为特征。个体所处情境既包括外源性特征, 如情境中危险线索, 依恋对象的声音或照片等, 也包括内源性特征, 如个体回忆和心境等。因情境特征的复杂、多变, 状态性依恋常表现出不同于特质性依恋的特征。状态性依恋意味着个体嵌套于当前情境中, 个体的依恋反应是灵活且可修正的, 该类特征有助于个体适应当前环境。尽管Bowlby (1969/1982)提出依恋系统具有情境敏感性, 个体依恋特征并非静态、不变的, 但后来研究者仅将情境特征变化作为捕获个体特质性依恋的工具和方法, 如在陌生情境测验中, 研究者通过操纵情境(母婴分离和团聚)引发婴幼儿的依恋行为, 以对母婴依恋关系进行分类(Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978)。随着依恋研究中认知转向的出现, 研究者开始借鉴认知心理学的实验范式, 特别是启动范式, 对情境线索如何影响依恋相关心理和行为进行研究(Bryant & Bali, 2018; Gillath & Karantzas, 2018; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2017)。在依恋启动研究中, 研究者通过操纵刺激材料改变个体所处情境的特征, 探究个体特质性依恋与情境的交互作用。在依恋启动范式中, 启动效应是状态性依恋的表现或其发挥作用的结果, 研究者通过依恋启动效应可以深入了解状态性依恋。

传统社会和人格研究中, 常以“时间”作为特质性和状态性心理和行为划分的标准, 如Gillath等(2009)开发的成人状态依恋问卷(State Adult Attachment Measure, SAAM)即将依恋行为特征的持续时间作为区分特质性依恋和状态性依恋的标准。而本文对特质性依恋和状态性依恋的界定是从信息加工过程的角度进行的。特质性依恋反映了个体长期依恋特征的平均水平, 而状态性依恋因为情境的复杂、变化性, 常表现为对特质性依恋的暂时偏离。

依恋特征的二重性与信息加工中自上而下和自下而上两类加工过程密切相关。从信息加工的视角看, 个体在依恋相关任务中的表现, 既包含自上而下依恋表征驱动的加工过程, 也包括自下而上情境线索驱动的加工过程(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016b), 两者共同决定了个体最终表现出的心理和行为特征。个体生而具有的依恋系统会对当前依恋相关物理和心理线索和依恋对象可用性(availability)进行评估, 并结合内部工作模式设定个体当前依恋目标 (Bretherton, 1985)。依恋目标驱使个体在需要时向重要他人寻求亲密, 以减轻痛苦并保护自己免受威胁(Bowlby, 1969/1982, 1973)。个体最终表现出的依恋特征是由个体内部工作模式和当前情境特征共同决定的(Fraley, 2007; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016a)。个体内部工作模式具有相对稳定性, 但其所处的情境(如是否存在危险, 依恋对象是否在身边等)则是时刻变化的, 这决定了个体依恋在不同情境下既会表现出某些共同特征, 也会表现出情境特异性特征。

应注意, 尽管状态性依恋和纵向研究中的依恋可变性都强调“变化”, 但两者不可混为一谈。前者所强调的变化是指在某一具体情境中依恋特征的暂时性改变; 而后者则是指特质性依恋在较长时期内是可以变化的。从个体发展历程的角度看, 在一段时间内个体依恋模式具有相对稳定性, 而个体发展, 生活环境变化、新的依恋关系形成等均会在一定程度上改变个体原有的依恋模式(Feeney, 2016; Fraley, 2007)。这与Piaget (1954)提出的同化和顺应观点一致, 个体在与环境的交互中, 通过同化过程, 个体依恋模式得以保持相对稳定, 而通过顺应过程, 个体依恋模式又会发生变化, 同化和顺应过程交互作用塑造了个体的依恋模式。尽管传统依恋理论认为在发展过程中个体依恋模式具有相对稳定性(Fraley & Roisman, 2019), 但纵向研究发现儿童养育环境与其成年后的依恋模式平均相关效应值约为0.15 (Fraley, Roisman, Booth-LaForce, Owen, & Holland, 2013; Chopik, Moors, & Edelstein, 2014)。再者, 发展时期也是影响依恋稳定性的因素之一, 依恋模式发展的社会化-选择不对称模型(socialization- selection asymmetries)认为儿童依恋模式会表现出更高的变化性, 而成人则表现出更高的稳定性。

总之, 在个体发展过程中特质性依恋是可变的, 而在较短时间内个体依恋既会表现出相对稳定的特征也会表现出情境特异性特征。个体依恋模式的二重性体现了依恋在人类进化过程中的适应意义, 即为适应不断变化的环境, 个体依恋相关心理和行为需取得稳定性和情境敏感性的动态平衡。

尽管Bowlby (1969/1982)在依恋理论建构时就提出, 个体依恋行为具有情境敏感性, 但受研究方法的限制, 传统研究工具大多旨在测量个体的特质性依恋, 如陌生情境测验、Q分类法和故事完成测验等(Ainsworth et al., 1978; Bretherton et al., 1990; Waters & Deane, 1985), 并不能对状态性依恋及两者之间的关系进行研究。随着启动范式在依恋领域的应用, 研究者可以在同一任务中同时考察特质性依恋和状态性依恋的关系 (Birnbaum, Hirschberger, & Goldenberg, 2011; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Hudson & Fraley, 2018; Mikulincer, Hirschberger, Nachmias, & Gillath, 2001; Stupica, Brett, Woodhouse, & Cassidy, 2018)。研究者通常用依恋维度(依恋焦虑和依恋回避)和依恋类型反映特质性依恋, 用依恋启动效应反映状态性依恋或状态性依恋的结果。依恋启动效应按启动刺激效价可分为安全启动效应和不安全启动效应(Gabriel, Kawakami, Bartak, Kang, & Mann, 2010; Granqvist, Mikulincer, Gewirtz, & Shaver, 2012)。需要注意的是在启动条件下, 状态性依恋与依恋启动效应并不相同。在依恋启动范式中, (外源性和内源性)启动刺激会引起个体依恋特征的状态性改变, 而依恋特征的状态性改变可能影响与依恋并非直接相关的认知加工和行为, 如创造性问题解决、团体认同和抑郁症状等(Carnelley, Bejinaru, Otway, Baldwin, & Rowe, 2018; Mikulincer, Shaver, & Rom, 2011; Rosenthal et al., 2012)。启动刺激作用下, 个体表现出的不同于特质性依恋的、与依恋直接相关的信息加工过程和行为特征才属于状态性依恋。这种改变及由其引起的其他与依恋并非直接相关认知和行为的变化均属于依恋启动效应。这些与依恋并非直接相关的认知和行为的改变在一定程度上也可以反映个体状态性依恋, 因此个体依恋维度得分或依恋类型与依恋启动效应的交互作用为认识个体特质性依恋和状态性依恋的关系提供了窗口。

安全依恋启动通过向被试呈现与依恋相关的刺激(如依恋对象的名字或照片), 激活依恋安全基地(secure base)相关心理表征进而影响个体后续心理和行为反应。安全依恋启动效应与依恋焦虑存在不同的交互作用模式。有研究表明低焦虑个体更容易受安全依恋启动影响, 而高焦虑个体则不易受此影响。安全启动后低焦虑个体对共情记忆的通达性更高(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001), 情绪感受更积极(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018), 而在这些研究中均未发现安全启动对高焦虑个体的显著影响。但也有研究发现了与之相反的模式。安全启动可以增强高焦虑个体对依恋相关词汇的通达性(Gokce & Harma, 2018), 减少对创伤记忆的回忆(Bryant & Foord, 2016), 降低对应激和消极情绪的易感性(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Schoemann, Gillath, & Sesko, 2012), 以及提高共情水平(Cassidy, Stern, Mikulincer, Martin, & Shaver, 2018)。同时, 在人际互动层面, 高焦虑个体在安全启动后更倾向于维持关系, 更少解除关系, 对社会联结强度和关系多重性的评分更高(Gillath, Karantzas, & Selcuk, 2017), 并更少使用自我责备(self-blame)分手策略(Collins & Gillath, 2012)。以上研究均未在低焦虑个体中发现安全启动效应。

与上述发现类似, 安全依恋启动效应与依恋回避间也存在不同的交互作用模式。有研究发现, 低回避个体更容易受安全依恋启动影响。在个体水平, 对于低回避个体, 安全启动会提高其共情记忆的通达性 (Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001), 减少创伤记忆闯入(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Bryant & Foord, 2016), 增强情绪体验的积极性并降低压力易感性(Bryant & Bali, 2018; Bryant & Chan, 2017; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Schoemann et al., 2012)。在人际互动水平, 安全启动后, 低回避个体更倾向于寻求物质支持和精神支持(Gillath et al., 2006), 维持网络社交关系(Gillath et al., 2017)。但也有研究发现了相反的模式, 即高回避个体更容易受安全依恋启动效应影响。安全启动会降低高回避个体从遗憾中习得教训的感觉(Schoemann et al., 2012), 降低解除关系的倾向(Gillath et al., 2017), 降低其使用回避/退缩分手策略的倾向(Collins & Gillath, 2012), 并提高对他人需要的反应性(Mikulincer, Shaver, Sahdra, & Bar-On, 2013)。

此外, 安全依恋启动对依恋焦虑和依恋回避得分的影响也不同, 研究采用重复启动范式发现, 安全启动会降低个体焦虑维度得分, 而对回避维度得分无影响(Hudson & Fraley, 2018)。研究者还探究了依恋类型与安全依恋启动的交互作用。研究发现焦虑型个体更容易从安全启动中获益, 如安全启动后焦虑型个体对痛苦强度的评分更低(Pan, Zhang, Liu, Ran, & Teng, 2017), 更多向他人寻求安慰(Evraire, Ludmer, & Dozois, 2014), 而对其他不安全依恋类型个体甚至会产生消极影响, 如安全启动会提高恐惧型个体对痛苦强度的评分(Pan et al., 2017), 减少回避型个体向他人寻求安慰的倾向(Evraire et al., 2014)。此外, 其他因素也会调节两者间的交互作用, 如在非压力条件下, 安全启动可以提高恐惧型个体对抽象材料的喜爱程度, 而在威胁情境下, 则对其无显著影响(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001)。

不安全依恋启动可分为依恋威胁启动、依恋焦虑启动和依恋回避启动。威胁启动通过向被试呈现与依恋相关的威胁刺激(如分离相关图片、记忆等)影响个体依恋系统(Gabriel et al., 2010; Marks & Vicary, 2016; Rosenthal et al., 2012)。威胁刺激并未直接激活某一具体的依恋图式, 而是使依恋系统处于激活状态(Bretherton, 1985), 随后个体长期通达性最高的依恋表征或图式将被激活, 被激活图式或表征将驱动接下来的加工过程。依恋焦虑启动和回避启动则旨在激活与依恋焦虑和依恋回避相关的图式, 进而暂时改变个体当前依恋状态(Boag & Carnelley, 2016; Jarvinen & Paulus, 2017; Melen, Pepping, & O'Donovan, 2017)。

威胁启动效应与依恋焦虑和依恋回避之间均存在不同的交互作用模式。对于威胁启动效应与依恋焦虑的关系, 有研究发现, 威胁启动会影响低焦虑个体而不会影响高焦虑个体, 如威胁启动会降低低焦虑个体对浪漫性爱的渴望, 而对高焦虑个体的影响不显著(Birnbaum et al., 2011)。但也有研究发现, 威胁启动会影响高焦虑个体, 而对低焦虑个体则无影响, 如威胁启动会降低高焦虑个体对距离相关词汇的通达性(Marks & Vicary, 2016), 对抽象材料评分的积极程度(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001), 而在低焦虑个体中则无显著效应。对于威胁启动效应与依恋回避的关系, 有研究发现威胁启动会影响低回避个体而不会影响高回避个体, 如威胁启动会提高低回避个体对依恋对象名字的通达性(Mikulincer, Gillath, & Shaver, 2002), 而高回避个体则不然。也有研究发现了与之相反的模式, 威胁启动下男性回避水平越高其对伴侣照片的注意广度越大, 注意越不集中(Dewitte & Koster, 2014), 同时, 威胁启动会降低高回避女性的性欲望, 提高高回避男性的性欲望(Birnbaum et al., 2011), 而对低回避个体无影响。此外, 目标任务性质也会影响威胁启动与依恋回避之间的交互作用, 如个体对不同词汇的反应任务中, 威胁启动后回避水平越高个体对依恋对象相关词汇的通达性越低, 而对中性词和非词, 则不存在交互作用(Granqvist et al., 2012)。

除依恋维度外, 研究者还考察了威胁启动效应与依恋类型的交互作用, 但相关研究较少。研究发现在威胁启动条件下, 安全型个体反应更加开放和激进, 而不安全个体则更加保守, 如威胁启动后安全型个体更倾向于支持自由派候选人, 而不安全个体更倾向于支持保守派候选人(Weise et al., 2008)。此外, 目标任务性质和个体状态等会影响两者间的交互作用。对于目标任务性质, 在威胁启动条件下, 安全型、回避型和焦虑型个体对依恋相关词汇的通达性无差异; 而对于心理距离词汇, 焦虑型和安全型个体显著高于回避型个体。认知负荷也会影响两者的交互作用, 在低认知负荷条件下, 回避型个体对心理词汇的反应与安全型类似, 而在高认知负荷条件下, 回避型与焦虑型个体的反应均快于安全型个体(Mikulincer, Birnbaum, Woddis, & Nachmias, 2000)。

在不安全启动研究中, 对依恋焦虑启动与依恋回避启动与特质性依恋之间交互作用的研究相对较少, 但研究发现焦虑依恋启动与特质性依恋, 特别是与依恋焦虑存在交互作用。研究发现, 焦虑启动会提高低焦虑个体的进食量, 而对高焦虑个体无显著影响(Wilkinson, Rowe, & Heath, 2013)。再者, 依恋焦虑启动会降低高焦虑男性对亲密的渴望, 并使其在性幻想中的自我和他人表征更加消极(Birnbaum, Simpson, Weisberg, Barnea, & Assulin-Simhon, 2012)。值得注意的是, 有研究发现重复焦虑启动会降低高焦虑个体的焦虑水平(Hudson & Fraley, 2018)。这可能是因为该研究中焦虑启动采用了回忆叙事范式, 对消极关系的反思可能帮助焦虑个体修通其与亲密关系相关的负性信念和预期(Fredrickson, Cohn, Coffey, Pek, & Finkel, 2008)。此外, 焦虑启动可能会使回避型个体采用的抑制激活策略失效, 研究发现, 焦虑启动会提高高回避个体在共情情境下体验到的个人压力(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001), 这可能是因为回忆范式下要求回忆与亲密关系相关的消极记忆构成了额外威胁, 损害了其回避策略的使用(Mikulincer & Florian, 2001)。

尽管上述研究均稳健地表明, 特质性依恋与依恋启动引发的状态性依恋之间存在交互作用, 但也有许多研究表明无论在个体层面还是人际层面, 依恋二重特征的效应彼此独立, 即依恋启动效应独立于个体特质性依恋。在个体层面, 研究发现个体对威胁刺激的反应, 无论以心率、皮肤电活动还是以表情为指标, 安全依恋启动与依恋焦虑和回避维度均不存在交互作用(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Stupica et al., 2018), 且安全启动对反应抑制和挫折引起的情绪反应的影响也独立于依恋两维度(Karreman, Vingerhoets, & Bekker, 2019; Li et al., 2016)。同时, 安全依恋启动后, 个体在自传记忆回忆连贯性、具体性, 消极记忆闯入, 积极情绪通达性, 对挫折的情绪反应, 负性情绪管理中的表现均不受依恋维度的影响(Bryant & Bali, 2018; Bryant & Foord, 2016; Clear & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2017; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001)。而在人际互动层面也得到了一致结果, 关于浪漫嫉妒、网络攻击行为、偏见、人际应激、人格化策略、共情、帮助寻求和为他人提供帮助和支持等的研究均发现启动效应独立于个体特质性依恋(Bartz, Tchalova, & Fenerci, 2016; Gillath et al., 2006; Liu, Huo, Chen, & Song, 2018; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer et al., 2013; Pardess, Mikulincer, Dekel, & Shaver, 2014; Saleem et al., 2015; Selterman & Maier, 2013)。如对于他人需要的共情反应, 安全启动效应和特质性依恋分别独立挥发作用, 安全启动会增加个体在共情情境中自我报告的共情反应, 而依恋焦虑和回避会降低共情反应, 且两者之间不存在交互作用(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001)。

除安全启动的研究外, 不安全启动研究也发现特质性依恋与状态性依恋之间不存在交互作用。研究发现威胁启动会提高对依恋对象名字的通达性, 如母亲和离世的亲人, 且该效应独立于依恋焦虑和依恋回避(Carr & Landau, 2012; Mancini & Bonanno, 2012; Mikulincer et al., 2002)。再者, 压力启动会提高个体对亲近相关观念的通达性(Mikulincer et al., 2000)。此外, 关于个体对与上帝相关观念的认知开放性, 研究发现依恋焦虑启动、回避启动和安全启动与依恋回避和焦虑无交互作用(Jarvinen & Paulus, 2017)。可见, 无论安全依恋启动还是不安全依恋启动条件下均有研究发现依恋二重特征间不存在交互作用。

实证研究表明特质性依恋和依恋启动效应之间的关系模式十分复杂, 甚至存在方向相反的交互作用模式, 仅仅将这些不一致结果归因为误差显然并不合适。如何厘清这些复杂的结果, 并用同一理论框架进行解释, 有助于研究者对依恋二重特征的性质、功能及其之间的关系有更清晰、深入的认识。传统依恋理论主要包括两部分：(1)规范部分(normative aspect), 该部分主要是关于依恋系统及其发展的常态和普遍特征; (2)个体差异部分, 该部分主要是关于依恋系统运作的个体差异(Bowlby, 1969/1982)。与之对应, Mikulincer和Shaver (2016a)为解释情境刺激对个体依恋心理和行为的影响提出了依恋系统激活两阶段模型, 该模型为整合和解释上述复杂的交互作用模式提供了框架。

Mikulincer和Shaver (2016a)认为, 一旦个体评估发现情境中存在威胁, 依恋系统就会被自动激活, 该激活过程包括两个阶段。第一阶段, 威胁评估将导致依恋系统的潜意识激活, 并自动化地增强对依恋相关表征、想法和行为倾向的通达性。依恋系统激活的第一阶段与传统依恋理论中规范部分相对应, 该部分的核心观点是个体在感受到威胁时, 无论个体特质性依恋特征如何, 依恋系统均会被激活(Bowlby, 1969/1982)。不安全启动研究为该观点提供了证据, 研究发现在威胁启动或依恋焦虑和依恋回避启动条件下, 个体对依恋对象和亲近相关表征的通达性提高, 且该效应独立于依恋焦虑和回避维度得分(Carr & Landau, 2012; Jarvinen & Paulus, 2017)。既然依恋系统激活第一阶段的结果是激活依恋和亲密相关依恋表征, 提高其通达性, 那么直接激活这些依恋相关表征也应产生类似的效果。研究发现安全启动刺激会提高依恋相关表征的通达性 (Bryant & Bali, 2018), 抑制负性表征和负性情绪的激活, 提高情绪的积极性(Bryant & Foord, 2016; Clear & Zimmer- Gembeck, 2017)。这些被激活的积极表征和情绪将主导个体当前的心智状态, 使个体以更加积极、灵活和开放的方式应对威胁 (Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Stupica et al., 2018), 进行人际互动(Bartz et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Pardess et al., 2014; Saleem et al., 2015; Selterman & Maier, 2013)。无论是威胁刺激激活依恋系统, 提高亲密等依恋表征的通达性, 还是直接激活依恋安全相关表征, 两种方式均能对个体后续的心理和行为产生影响。尽管依恋理论的规范部分认为无论个体依恋特征如何, 个体在感知到威胁时依恋系统均会被自动激活, 但个体对情境刺激的评估可能受个体特质性依恋的影响, 所以Mikulicner和Shaver (2016a)认为该阶段依恋系统激活受过度激活和抑制激活依恋策略相关的兴奋性和抑制性环路影响。该观点也得到了实证研究的支持, 如威胁启动会提高低回避个体对依恋对象名字的通达性, 而对高回避个体无影响(Mikulincer et al., 2002), 还有研究发现, 威胁启动会降低高焦虑个体积极情绪激活, 而对低焦虑个体无影响(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001); 类似地, 研究发现安全启动可以提高低焦虑和低回避个体共情记忆的通达性, 而对高焦虑和高回避个体无影响(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001)。

第二阶段, 依恋相关心理表征的潜意识激活可以塑造个体当前的心理状态, 甚至在个体意识到之前影响个体的行为计划(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016), 并且这些被激活表征将唤起有意识的、与亲密寻求相关的想法, 主导个体接下来的活动, 并在很多情况下转化为寻求亲密和保护的可见行为。在该阶段个体基于依恋经验形成的特质性依恋将发挥更大作用, 换句话说, 该阶段依恋个体差异将表现得更加明显。特质性依恋与依恋启动效应表现出不同交互作用模式可能与具有不同特质性依恋特征个体偏好的依恋表征和策略有关。依恋安全个体(低焦虑和低回避)通常采用安全基地策略, 并表现出积极的信息加工和人际互动, 而高焦虑和高回避个体则分别偏好过度激活策略和抑制激活策略, 表现出消极的信息加工和人际互动(Dykas & Cassidy, 2011)。

依恋焦虑反映了个体在需要时重要他人可得的程度以及害怕被拒绝和抛弃的程度(Moura- Ramos, Santos, & Canavaro, 2017)。高焦虑个体通常使用过度激活策略, 表现为长期对依恋信息保持高度警觉, 并伴随强烈的忧虑且努力、强迫性地获得依恋对象的爱和支持(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016b)。无论个体依恋焦虑水平如何, 安全启动均可提高个体依恋基地相关表征和情绪通达性(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Gokce & Harma, 2018; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001)。但高焦虑个体依恋表征通达性通常处于较高水平, 故低焦虑个体相对高焦虑个体更容易表现出安全启动效应。再者, 安全启动条件下个体安全基地相关表征激活水平提高, 高焦虑个体将体验到更强的依恋安全感, 进而使其之后的认知和行为表现更加积极(Bryant & Foord, 2016; Cassidy et al., 2018; Schoemann et al., 2012)。而低焦虑个体依恋安全水平相对较高, 安全启动对其影响更小, 所以在这种情况下高焦虑个体更容易出现安全依恋启动效应。研究发现安全启动在高焦虑个体中会产生两种不同结果：(1)安全启动能够给高焦虑个体带来积极效应, 使其无论在信息加工还是人际互动中的表现更加积极、具有适应性(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Cassidy et al., 2018; Gillath et al., 2017; Gokce & Harma, 2018); (2)安全启动并不影响高焦虑个体的表现(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer et al., 2011)。产生以上两种不同结果可能是因为焦虑型个体的依恋表征网络内既包括与依恋安全、亲密相关的积极表征, 也包括不安全依恋相关的消极表征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007)。因此, 若安全启动刺激激活积极表征, 则会产生安全启动效应, 若安全启动刺激让被试联想到消极经验, 激活消极表征, 则个体不会表现出安全启动效应, 甚至产生消极影响(Mallinckrodt et al., 2013)。在不安全依恋启动, 特别是威胁启动条件下, 高焦虑个体感受到更高的不安全感, 此时个体将采用防御性策略应对威胁, 进而使得之后的认知和行为更加消极, 如情绪体验更加消极(Mikulincer, Hirschberger et al., 2001)。而低焦虑个体安全水平较高, 能够更加积极地应对威胁(Rosenthal et al., 2012), 更少表现出不适应性行为(Birnbaum et al., 2011)。值得注意的是, Hudson和Fraley (2018)研究发现重复焦虑启动会降低高焦虑个体的焦虑水平。这可能是因为研究采用回忆叙事范式, 对消极关系的反思可能帮助焦虑个体修通其与亲密关系相关的负性信念和预期(Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991; Fredrickson et al., 2008)。由此可推断, 在阈上条件下依恋不安全启动的效应在很大程度上取决于个体对启动刺激的主观评估, 这与Mikulincer和Shaver (2016)的观点一致。

依恋回避反映了个体努力维持行为独立及与重要他人维持情绪距离的程度(Moura-Ramos et al., 2017), 高回避个体倾向于使用抑制激活策略, 通过抑制依恋系统激活避免可能产生的痛苦(Dykas & Cassidy, 2011; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016)。当安全启动效应体现为提高个体依恋相关的认知和行为表现时, 低回避个体更容易表现出安全启动效应。低回避个体依恋安全感较高, 在安全启动条件下能够以更开放、积极的方式应对威胁、进行信息加工和人际互动(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Bryant & Foord, 2016; Gillath et al., 2017; Gillath et al., 2006; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer et al., 2011)。而高回避个体在面对威胁时, 通常采用抑制激活策略, 抑制对依恋相关刺激的通达性(Dewitte & Koster, 2014; Granqvist et al., 2012), 因此更不容易表现出安全启动效应。当安全启动效应体现为降低个体依恋相关消极行为时, 高回避更容易表现出安全启动效应(Collins & Gillath, 2012; Gillath et al., 2017; Mikulincer et al., 2013)。这可能是因为低回避个体通常能以积极的方式进行依恋相关的信息加工和人际互动, 消极行为相对较少, 因而更不容表现出安全启动效应。应注意, 高回避个体面对的“威胁”是经个体主观评价的结果, 即使客观刺激性质是安全的, 但若个体将其评价为威胁的, 也将驱使其采用抑制激活策略(Evraire et al., 2014)。但抑制激活策略并非在任何情境下均有效, 当该策略需要的认知资源被占用时就会失效, 研究表明该策略在低认知负荷下有效, 而在高认知负荷下则会失效(Mikulincer et al., 2000)。

综上, 安全启动效应主要体现在两个方面, 提高安全依恋个体依恋相关的适应性心理和行为表现, 降低不安全个体与依恋相关的消极认知和行为表现。而对于威胁启动, 依恋安全个体通常可以有效应对威胁刺激, 而高焦虑和高回避个体分别倾向于采用过度激活和抑制激活策略应对威胁。个体特质性依恋特征及启动刺激引起的状态性依恋特征共同影响了个体在具体情境中的表现。

个体在某一情境中表现出的依恋心理和行为是特质性依恋与情境引发状态性依恋相互作用、共同决定的。个体依恋模式处于稳定性与变化性之间张力的平衡中。依恋特征的二重性既保证了个体的同一性, 也使个体对环境的反应具有适应性。特质性依恋与依恋启动效应的多种交互作用模式为理解依恋二重性提供了实证证据, 依恋系统激活两阶段模型为理解、整合这些结果提供了框架。但在该领域仍然存在许多分歧和不足, 需要未来进一步研究。

当前采用依恋启动范式对于依恋二重性关系的研究存在的一个问题是大部分依恋启动研究未提供操作检验, 在这种情况下研究者更多通过结果事后推测依恋启动的有效性, 但并未提供直接证据证明依恋启动的有效性。这是因为操作检验可能引起被试对实验目的的猜测或降低本来就较弱的启动效应, 进而影响实验结果(Birnbaum et al., 2012)。Birnbaum等(2012)在研究中额外招募了一组被试只用于启动有效性的检验, 他们要求被试在启动完成后评价自己害怕被抛弃的程度, 结果表明焦虑启动组评分显著高于安全启动组。Schoemann等(2012)通过对被试在依恋想象启动任务中想象内容进行编码和分析确保被试进行了相应的想象, 但他们也未直接检验启动效应。Deng等(2016)通过实验组与控制组在完成启动任务后对当下感到安全、温暖、支持和想要给别人拥抱的程度的评分检验安全激活程度; 而Pan等(2017)通过启动前后的状态依恋问卷得分比较检验了启动效应。上述方法只可用于阈上依恋启动效应的操作检验, 不适用于阈下启动方法的检验。将来研究者应进一步优化阈上启动效应的检验方法, 同时发展适用于阈下启动效应的检验方法。

当前关于依恋二重性关系的研究多采用依恋焦虑和依恋回避两维度得分作为个体特质性依恋的指标。研究之所以多采用依恋维度描述个体特质性依恋是因其在某些方面更具优势(Fraley et al., 2015)。但当前依恋研究很多研究常分别对焦虑和回避进行单独分析, 而未考虑两者之间的交互作用(Gillath et al., 2015; Marks & Vicary, 2016; Mikulincer et al., 2014)。但有研究发现在依恋启动、依恋焦虑和依恋回避之间存在三者交互作用, 如Pan等(2017)发现对焦虑维度得分较高者, 若其回避维度得分高于一个标准差, 则安全依恋启动会降低其对痛苦图片的评分, 若其回避维度得分低于一个标准差则会提高其评分; 而低焦虑得分个体无论其回避维度得分如何, 均未发现启动效应。Schoemann等(2012)也发现了安全依恋启动与焦虑和回避间的三者交互作用, 安全启动可以降低高焦虑-低回避个体的遗憾感, 而对其他被试无显著影响; 同时安全依恋启动可以提高高焦虑-高回避个体通过错误学习的感觉, 而降低低焦虑-高回避个体通过错误学习的感觉, 并对其他类型的被试无显著影响。将来依恋启动研究中采用依恋维度测量个体特质性依恋时, 应考虑两维度间的交互作用。

目前研究中高焦虑与依恋启动效应存在不同的作用模式。有研究发现不安全启动会给高焦虑个体带来负面影响, 如降低情绪积极性和对同伴团体的认同等(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001; Rosenthal et al., 2012), 增加高焦虑个体的消极情绪体验(Mallinckrodt et al., 2013), 有研究

则表明高焦虑个体不受不安全启动的影响(Birnbaum et al., 2011), 甚至Hudson和Fraley (2018)发现重复焦虑启动会降低高焦虑个体的焦虑水平。这些不一致结果可能与焦虑型个体依恋表征的复杂性有关。焦虑个体的依恋表征可能是双效价的, 既有积极表征, 也有消极表征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007)。激活不同表征可能会产生不同结果, 将来研究应关注焦虑个体依恋表征的双效价性, 采用更具针对性的启动材料, 进一步揭示高焦虑与依恋启动效应产生不同作用模式的原因。

根据依恋系统激活的两阶段模型, 从激活依恋系统的刺激呈现至个体做出反应存在两个过程(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016)。第一阶段更多是自动化的, 而第二阶段个体特质性依恋将发挥更大作用。回避型个体倾向于采用抑制策略而焦虑型个体通常采用过度激活策略, 但这些依恋应对策略在信息加工中何时发挥作用仍不清晰。依恋策略是在个体对刺激进行评估时发挥作用, 还是在评估后做出反应时才发挥作用?未来研究应从信息加工时间进程角度对该问题进一步研究。此外, 依恋策略发挥作用是否需要意识参与也值得关注。研究发现阈下启动在创造性问题解决表现中, 启动效应独立于个体依恋特质性, 而在阈上启动条件下, 低焦虑个体表现出更高的创造性问题解决行为, 而对高焦虑个体无影响(Mikulincer et al., 2011), 这似乎说明个体意识参与是高焦虑个体的依恋策略发挥效用的条件, 这一问题也值得将来研究进一步关注。

想改善与伴侣的亲密关系，最好了解一下依恋类型

Gone Girl

之前回答了一个问题：男朋友对我态度冷淡，应该怎么办？发现许多朋友对其中的亲密关系测验很感兴趣，而且测完之后发觉自己属于非安全型依恋，来具体询问怎么办，所以特别整理了早先所学，尽量通俗易懂地从依恋的概念、儿童的依恋类型和成人的依恋类型三个方面来说明我们如今的依恋类型是如何产生的，又是如何影响我们与他人发展亲密关系的，最后，稍加探讨如何转变依恋类型。

依恋

依恋这个概念最早是由英国精神病学家鲍尔比(John Bowlby，1969)提出的，他在洛伦兹(Konrad Lorenz)的研究(婴儿对母亲的印刻理论)和哈洛(Harry Harlow)的实验(幼猴尽管由铁丝做的母猴喂养，但却寻求依偎于有绒织物的母猴)的基础上，将依恋定义为“个体与具有特殊意义的他人形成牢固的情感纽带的倾向，能为个体提供安全和安慰”。鲍尔比提出依恋这个概念主要是用来解释婴儿与其养护者之间的情感联系，但后来的研究者们将之扩展到了成人之间。

现在我们一般认为，依恋(attachment)是个体与主要抚养者发展出的一种特殊的、积极的情感纽带，也是指个体寻求并企图与另一个体在身体和情感上保持亲密联系的倾向。

依恋既是个体最初的社会性联结，也是情感社会化的重要标志。简单来说，通过依恋他人我们不再是一个孤单的个体，而是一个融入了集体的社会人。

了解的依恋的基本内涵，接下来，我们来看看依恋类型这个概念又是如何提出的。

儿童的依恋类型

说到依恋类型(attachment styles)，就不能不提到陌生情境实验(Strange Situation)，该实验是由艾斯沃斯等(Mary Ainsworth & Witting,1969)设计的，他们首先安排母婴在一个完全陌生的环境中，然后让婴儿分别经历母亲离开、陌生人进入等情境。观察婴儿在与母亲分离和相聚的过程中，以及面对陌生人的过程中的表现，从而对婴儿的依恋类型进行判断。具体如下：



注：第一个场景持续 30 秒，其余各场景均为 3 分钟。

艾斯沃斯等人长期观察了乌干达和美国家庭母子间的相互作用，利用上述研究方法，根据婴儿在陌生情境中的不同反应，将婴儿依恋划分为以下三种类型：

① 安全型依恋(secure attachment)

主要表现为在与母亲一起时，将其作为“安全基地”，以母亲为中心主动去探索环境，并不是总以为在母亲身旁，只通过偶尔的靠近或眼神注视与母亲交流，母亲在场时，婴儿感到足够的安全；当母亲离开时，明显表现出苦恼、不安；但当母亲回来时，会立即寻求与母亲接触，将其作为“避风港湾”，易被安抚。约占 65%～70%。

而安全型婴儿的母亲一般对孩子的信号及情绪表达（呼求、肢体动作等）很敏感，能及时了解孩子的想法，鼓励孩子进行探索，而且喜欢和孩子有亲密的接触。

② 回避型依恋(avoidant attachment)

主要表现为与母亲刚分离时并不难过，但独自在陌生环境中呆一段时间后会感到焦虑。容易与陌生人相处，容易适应陌生的环境，很容易从陌生人那里获得安慰。当分离后再见到母亲时，对母亲采取回避态度；有人也把这类婴儿称为“无依恋婴儿”。约占 20%。

回避型婴儿的母亲有多种类型。有的对孩子缺乏耐心，当孩子干扰自己的计划和活动时生孩子气或怨恨孩子，对孩子的信号反应迟钝；有的对孩子经常表现出消极情感，即使对孩子表达积极情感，程度也很微弱……因此两者之间并没有形成特别密切的感情联结。

③ 焦虑—矛盾型依恋(anxious-ambivalent attachment)

主要表现为每当母亲要离开前就显得很警惕，当母亲离开时表现得非常苦恼、极度反抗，任何一次短暂的分离都会引起大喊大叫。但当母亲回来时，其对母亲的态度又是矛盾的，既寻求与母亲接触，但同时又反抗与母亲接触。当母亲亲近他时，生气地拒绝、推开，但是要他重新回去做游戏似乎又不太容易，不时朝母亲这里看。约占 10%～15%。

反抗型婴儿的母亲常误解孩子的信号，她的照顾行为是不一致的，对孩子的反应更多地依赖于自己当时的心境，而不是孩子的行为。因此，在孩子的信号和母亲的情绪表达间常表现出不一致。

在这三种依恋类型中，回避型与反抗型都属于不安全型依恋。婴儿对母亲的依恋类型既具有明显的稳定性，但同时，在家庭环境经历较大变化，母亲与婴儿的交往发生较大转变时，也可能发生变化。

那么，问题来了，依恋类型的差异是如何产生的呢？

这是一个复杂的问题，在这简单说说。

依恋类型差异的产生

心理学中一直存在着关于遗传与环境（或者说，天性与教养）的争论(nature-nurture controversy)，即人的发展是在出生之前就由遗传和生物因素预先决定的，还是受后天经验和环境因素决定的？

现在，我们一般认为：遗传是心理发展的生物前提，环境是心理发展的决定性条件(其中教育条件在个体心理发展中起着主导作用)。遗传与环境互相作用和影响，共同决定着个体的发展，对于不同的心理因素，它们所起作用的比例不同。

所以，依恋类型差异的产生既与个体本身先天的生物因素有关，也与后天的教养、所处的家庭环境等有关。

儿童先天特质尤其是气质与母亲的抚养困难程度密切相关，比如，我们常会看到一些儿童容易照料，与母亲关系融洽，容易接受抚慰；一些儿童很难照料，异常活跃，拒绝母亲的亲近，不易抚慰。【注意！这里的气质需与生活中常说的气质区分开来~ 心理学中气质(temperament)是指一个人与生俱来的一种稳定的心理特征，即我们平时所说的脾气、秉性，主要表现在心理活动的强度、速度、灵活性与指向性等方面的。人的气质差异是先天形成的，受神经系统活动过程的特性所制约。孩子刚出生时，最先表现出来的差异就是气质差异，比如有的孩子爱哭好动，有的孩子平稳安静。】

而关于后天影响依恋的家庭因素，鲍尔比提出在个体和依恋对象的实际交往中形成了个体和看护者（主要抚养者）之间的内部工作模式(internal working models)，该模式包括两种互为补充的成分：一个是关于依恋对象的，描述的是当婴儿需要时，看护者是否是可得的(available)、敏感的(sensitive)和有反应的(responsive)；另一个是关于自己的，涉及的是自我是否是有价值或值得关爱和看护的。例如：当需要时，看护者是敏感并总是可得的，那么婴儿就会发展出一种认为别人是有反应并可信的、自己是可爱的并有被照顾价值的内部工作模式。反之，当看护者是不一致和拒绝的，婴儿就有可能发展出别人是没有反应的、自己是不值得关爱的或自己是应该自我满足的和不需要别人关爱的。如此，内部工作模式构建了个体对早期依恋经验的心理表征，并在长大后影响其思想、情感和行为。

现在一般认为婴儿依恋的性质最根本取决于与婴儿有关的看护者的行为，依恋是在婴儿与看护者的相互交往和感情交流中逐渐形成的，在这一社会交往过程中，母亲对婴儿所发出的信号的敏感性和其对婴儿是否关心是最重要的方面。

由儿童过渡到成人 

在鲍尔比、艾斯沃斯等人之后，随着研究对象的不断扩展，研究者们开始讨论依恋原理与成人的亲密关系之间的相关性。通常认为，婴儿的依恋功能包括“维持亲密”（试图寻求和保持与依恋对象的亲近）和“抗拒分离”（寻求与看护者的亲密，拒绝分离）；“安全基地”（把依恋对象作为其探索外部世界的安全港湾）和“避风港湾”（当受到威胁的时候寻求依恋对象的帮助，获得安全）。进一步的研究发现，早期的人际经验会影响个体后来人际关系发展轨迹：安全型依恋的儿童快乐地与他人交往，很容易与他人发展出轻松信任的人际关系；回避型依恋的儿童经常怀疑和迁怒他人，不容易形成信任和亲密的人际关系；焦虑—矛盾型依恋的儿童与他人的关系常会变得紧张和过分依赖，表现出对他人的过分贪求。

Hazan & Shaver 于 1987 年在《婚恋关系是一种依恋关系》(Romantic Love Conceptualized as an Attachment Process)一文中第一次提出成人婚恋关系中的情感联结也可以被理解为一种依恋关系，它有着和早期依恋相似的生物系统，都是自然选择的产物。他们的研究表明成人在处理亲密关系时也会表现出类似的反应方式，婴儿的依恋系统特征——维持亲密，抗拒分离，安全基地和避风港湾——同样可以在成人的亲密关系中观察到。由此，依恋研究迅速成为人际关系科学最热的研究领域之一，而从成人依恋的角度研究亲密关系开始成为依恋研究热点领域，随之各种具有启发性的研究成果的陆续公布。

成人的依恋类型

当依恋理论发展到成人依恋领域的时候，Hazan & Shaver(1988)通过问卷调查提出：早期社会经验不同产生了关系风格上相对持久的差异，婴儿依恋中的三种主要的依恋类型(安全型、回避型、矛盾型)在成人的恋情中也得到了证实。在 Hazan 和 Shaver 提出婚恋依恋分为三种类型这一观点后，引来众多依恋专家的关注。1991 年，Barthofomew & Horowitz 的实验提出 Hazan 和 Shaver 之前所提出的回避型其实是两种完全不同的回避型，他们认为人们之所以要避免和他人亲密接触，是因为存在两种不同的原因。一种情况是人们期望和他人交往，但又对他人戒心重重，害怕被人拒绝和欺骗。另一种情况是人们独立自主、自力更生，真正地喜欢我行我素和自由自在，而不愿意与他人发生紧密的依恋关系。这就将成人的依恋类型分为了四种而非三种。

具体来说，成人的四种依恋类型如下：

第一种是安全型(secure)或安全—自主型(secure-autonomous)，和儿童的安全型依恋基本相同。这种类型的人认为自己是值得爱的，他人也是值得爱和信任的。

安全型依恋是一种稳定和积极的情绪联系，以爱情关系中的关怀、亲密感、支持和理解为标志的。这种类型的人认为自己是友好、善良和可爱的人，也认为别人普遍是友好、可靠和值得信赖的人。他们十分容易与其他人接近，总是放心地依赖他人和让别人依赖自己。一般来说，他们既不会过于担心被抛弃，也不怕别人在感情上与自己过于亲近。无论我们自己的依恋方式属于哪一种，大多数人都希望能找到一个安全依恋型的人做自己的伴侣。

第二种痴迷型(preoccupied)，是给予焦虑—矛盾型的新名称，因为这种类型的人若要感觉心安，就得过分地依赖于他人的赞许，所以他们过度地寻求认同，沉溺于人际关系。他们认为自己是不值得爱的和没有价值的，但是他人是可接受的，总是努力赢得他人的接纳，并以此支持消极的自我形象。

痴迷型依恋的特征是对人际关系怀着混合的情感，这就使人处于爱、恨、怀疑、拿不起、放不下的冲突情感之中，导致一种不稳定和矛盾的心理状态。通常，痴迷型的人总觉得自己被误解和不受赏识，认为自己的情人和朋友都不可靠，不愿意与自己建立持久的关系。矛盾依恋型的人担心他们的恋人并不真正爱自己，或者会离开自己。因此，他们一方面希望能与自己的恋人极为亲近，另一方面又对恋人是否可靠和可信满腹猜疑。

第三种和第四种依恋类型反映了两种不同的“回避型”。

回避型依恋常常表现出惧怕亲密关系和拒绝信赖别人的倾向。回避型依恋的人往往在关系未能向好的方向转变之前就开始退缩，他们对爱情多疑且冷淡，认为别人不可靠或过分急于对爱情做出承诺。结果是他们觉得难以完全相信和依赖别人，只要有人试图在感情上亲近他们，他们就开始紧张。从根本上讲，他们在回避亲密的关系。

恐惧型(fearful)的人对自己和他人的态度都是消极的，这种类型的成人可能出于害怕被拒绝而极力避免和他人发生亲密关系。虽然他们希望有人喜欢自己，但更担心自己因此离不开别人，而一旦建立了亲密关系，又往往会过度担心伴侣会离开自己，整天提心吊胆地防止冲突和其他代价过高的关系，有时想到与伴侣亲密相处时他们就会感到恐惧。

而疏离型(dismissing)的人对个人的看法相对积极（自己是有价值的），但是认为他人会拒绝自己，和他人发生亲密关系得不偿失。这种类型的成人会以避免与他人发生联系来作为保护自己不受伤害的手段。他们拒绝和他人相互依赖，因为他们相信自己能自力更生，也不在乎他人是否喜欢自己。他们会更关注替代选择，会留心任何可能的其他爱情选择，并且更容易被新结识的人所吸引。他们希望将来的伴侣不给他们提供帮助，因为他们不打算反过来做任何报答。

整体而言，安全依恋是以个体能够流畅地表达与依恋相关的经历和情感为特征的, 安全依恋使得人们可以更加准确地处理与同伴之间的相似经历和情感, 而不安全依恋是以防御性地拒绝或不能够整合与依恋经历有关的各种信息为特征的, 这会导致个体与他人之间沟通不畅、对他人抱有消极期待以及自身社会功能出现问题。

之后，Brennan, Clark, & Shaver（1998）用维度法来考察依恋风格, 他们认为, 依恋类型可以被概括为回避亲密和忧虑被弃两个维度。

回避亲密(avoidance of intimacy)的不同主要体现在会影响人们接纳相互依赖的亲密关系的难度和信任程度。在亲密关系中感到舒心和轻松的人，回避亲密的程度就低；而与伴侣亲密接触时烦躁不安的人，其回避亲密的程度就高。

忧虑被弃(anxiety about abandonment)的不同主要体现在是否会害怕他人认为自己没有价值而远离自己。安全性的人在与他人亲密接触中非常安心，不会担心别人会苛刻地对待自己，因而能积极快乐地寻求亲密、相互依赖的人际关系。相形之下，其他三种类型的人充满焦虑和不安，在亲密关系中如坐针毡。痴迷型的人渴望亲密接触但害怕被拒绝。疏离型的人并不担心被拒绝，但却不喜欢亲密接触。至于恐惧型的人则两者兼而有之，在亲密关系中坐立不安又担心亲密关系不能长久。

如果将类型法和维度法综合起来考虑, 那么我们可以得到一个两维度四分类。在这两个维度——回避亲密和忧虑被弃上的得分高低决定了成人依恋的不同类型：安全型——低回避、低焦虑；痴迷型——低回避，高焦虑；恐惧型——高回避、高焦虑；疏离型——高回避、低焦虑。

综上所述，我们可以得到下图：



关于这幅图，需要特别注意的是，回避亲密和忧虑被弃这两个依恋维度是由低到高连续变化的。这就意味着，虽然我们一直在讨论依恋类型的差异，好像它们不会重叠，是分离、纯粹的类别，但实际上并非如此。当要求被试从表中选出最符合自己的依恋类型时，大多数人认为自己是安全依恋型。然而，如果有人在回避亲密和忧虑被弃两个维度上都表现出中等水平，套用上述四种依恋类型中的任何一种都不太适合的。

或许，我们应该这么理解依恋的复杂性：存在忧虑和回避这两个重要因素，它们塑造了在人际交往中人们表现出的各种适应性行为。这两个因素都很重要，如果你比较任一维度上的高分和低分人群，就会发现他们处理人际关系的方式差别很大。而得分在中等水平则无关紧要，即使因为这些得分不同可以把他们归结为“安全型”和“疏离型”等不同的依恋风格。最近的依恋研究不再简单地把人们分为安全、痴迷、恐惧活疏远四种类型，而是给出人们在忧虑和回避两个维度中的相对位置。

尽管如此，把依恋类型分为四类简单明了，所以仍广泛使用，深入人心。但依恋风格差异最大的地方主要表现在安全型和不安全类型的人（高忧虑被弃或高回避亲密的人，或兼而有之）之间。

依恋类型的改变

依恋类型一旦形成，就决定了人们与他人交往时显示出的独特个体特征。这样，亲密关系中，双方某些依恋类型的匹配可能比其他的匹配要好得多，更让人满足和稳定。举例来说，假若痴迷型的人爱上疏离型的人，就产生了依恋类型的不匹配。痴迷型的人会因为对方的感情疏远而气馁，而疏离型的人则会因对方的依赖干预而烦恼，双方都不如与安全型的人相处轻松。

前面说了，依恋类型一方面受到与生俱来的个体特质（如气质）的影响，另一方面个体经验在塑造人际关系的 依恋类型上起着重要作用。所以，我们并不会只是被动的受到童年经验的束缚，依恋类型不断地受到我们成人后经历的影响。不过，尽管依恋类型能改变，但它们确定后相当稳定而持久，并影响人们建立新的人际关系。有关研究表明，如果没有大起大落的新经历，人们的依恋类型可以持续数十年不变。

那么，如果你属于不安全依恋，而又想改变自己（或者，你的 TA 是不安全依恋，你想改变 TA），该怎么办呢？大家的情况不同，有着各自的特殊之处，这里只能就其原则泛泛而谈咯（￣y▽￣）~

首先，希望你们共同来了解依恋理论，可以看我这篇科普文，也可以看其他更详细的书籍，比如这本：心理治疗中的依恋 (豆瓣)。很多时候，了解就是改变的动力源泉。

其次，不管是你自己或你的伴侣属于不安全依恋，都希望你们能够接纳自己，自我接纳是什么意思，又为何要自我接纳，可参看：为什么心理咨询要把接纳自己作为一件很重要的事去强调？ - 动机在杭州的回答。很多时候，接纳是改变的核心基础。

最后，既然治疗师可以通过与来访者之间建立亲密的依恋关系来使来访者重塑依恋类型，那为什么作为情侣的你们不能在自己的亲密关系中成长呢？

我相信，如果情侣双方共同理解自己的依恋特征及其形成的原因，在接纳自己行为和情绪的基础上对恋爱中的矛盾获得新的认知和评价，并且通过亲密关系中的积极体验改善自己的人际期望、情感体验定势和对他人与自我的表征性质，就可以实现亲密关系质量改善和个人安全成长的双向促进。

在这个过程中，个人以为双方的良好沟通是处理冲突、相互理解、包容接纳的基础，更是形成亲密关系中积极体验所不可或缺的。关于伴侣间如何沟通，可参看：如何维护长期的恋爱关系？ - 张俊杰的回答。

# “渴望爱，却充满回避和焦虑” | 恐惧型依恋者的6个迹象_ta_关系_行为


                        由内容质量、互动评论、分享传播等多维度分值决定，勋章级别越高(
                        
                        )，代表其在平台内的综合表现越好。
                    

你身边是否存在这样一种人：

ta渴望亲密，希望能接近潜在的依恋对象（朋友/伴侣），但当那些人靠得太近，ta们会变得非常不舒服，并渴望退出这段关系。

然而，觉察到对方离开，ta又变得焦虑，肝肠寸断。

因此，ta传达给别人的信息其实是：“我喜欢你，但你离我远点”。 

虽然这一类型在人群中的占比较小（约6%），但ta们往往具有最糟糕的情感体验和人际关系。

一些工作模型表明，恐惧型依恋更可能陷入虐待关系，与较高的边缘人格障碍、解离症状、孤独、抑郁风险相关。

恐惧型依恋者常具有如下【6个特征】：

1）情绪和行为不稳定且不可预测

当一个人处于“恐惧型”的状态下，ta既担心被抛弃，又对亲密感到不适。

换句话说，ta们没有“对亲密的应对方式”——ta想接近的潜在亲密对象，也是ta害怕接近的人。在关系中，这种行为常引起误会，让人迷惑不解。

2）对重要他人的“理想化”和“愤怒”

研究表明，恐惧依恋的成年人会防御性地组织行为，对重要他人出现“理想化（要求一个完美的伴侣）”和“愤怒”的交替情绪，以尽量减少被拒绝的痛苦。

比如为了不被拒绝，宁愿孤独地过日子。努力减少与他人的情感接触，同时又要延续关系。



3）拥有极度情绪化的关系

在情绪调节方面，恐惧依恋者往往比其他不安全类型的人更麻烦）。

比如，很难从愤怒中平静下来，或容易感到强烈的“被排斥感”……无法应对情绪上的“压倒性来袭”时，可能会做出一些破坏人际关系的行为。

4）ta可能有很多的性伴侣

☞ 一项跟踪600人近40年的研究发现，“恐惧依恋”可以预测个人一生中更多的性伴侣数量，以及更大的性依从性（sexual compliance，即遵从伴侣的性欲望）。对男女来说都是如此。

因为ta们渴望爱，却害怕亲密，而偶然的性关系可以让ta们置于这种处境：

性活动既增加了亲密度，逃离可能导致抑郁的想法，也让ta们在感情上保持距离。

5）ta们更易出现攻击和控制行为

相对其他不安全的依恋类型，恐惧依恋的男性更容易对女性产生敌意、配偶虐待和儿童性虐待。

6）缺乏自尊，有强烈的拒绝恐惧

从性别维度看，女性比男性更容易产生恐惧依恋。在女性样本中，恐惧依恋者具有“低自尊、沮丧和强烈的注意力需要”。

她们的共同点是，对他人有深深的不信任，不愿意寻求专业帮助。这可能与她们负面的自我看法和强烈的拒绝恐惧有关。

心理学博士Hal Shorey认为，恐惧依恋的成人，一般在童年时期有过至少一名养育者出现过“可怕的养育行为”。

这会在孩子体内产生一种对自身安全的恐惧——孩子下意识地觉察到，照顾者不能满足自己的需要。

然而，父母并不一定具备主观敌意。有精神疾病的家长也同样会让孩子感到害怕——因为孩子知道父母没有能力保护自己。

从神经生物学观点看，一些具有恐惧依恋对象的儿童，甚至可能无法全面发展出整合性的神经结构，导致成年后的情绪失调问题。

换句话说，孩子生来依恋父母，却不能将依恋者视为“安全基地”。

在以后的生活中，ta们会创造出一个想要亲密的人，但同时也会创造出一个害怕亲密的人。



1）克服对安全感的恐惧，寻求一段安全的关系

比如谈恋爱，大约50%的成年人拥有安全型依恋模式，几率其实还不错。

在新的关系中，你可以挑战自己的防御能力，并努力在这种关系中发展自己。

或者去见心理咨询师。心理咨询师会成为关系中的“安全基地”，与来访者重新建立一种新的、可靠的、具有接纳性的依恋关系，整合创伤，促进个人资源的整合。

2）为自己的经历写一个连贯的故事

依恋研究表明，儿童依恋类型的最佳预测因素并不是“父母经历了何种创伤”，而是“父母如何理解、解决这些创伤”。

对于未解决的创伤，一个很关键的做法是为自己创建连贯叙述的过程。重新讲述自己的故事本身，就可以“增强”安全感和个人心理弹性。

3）放下受害者模式，每个人都应为自己的选择负责

这个话题，算是老生常谈了。在亲密关系里，对对方总是不满意，但还选择关系继续的，那定是这段关系还有继续的价值。

归根结底，放弃还是继续，这是你权衡之后做出的一个选择。每个人都应为自己的选择负责。

如果你总觉得这个选择是被迫的，无奈的，只能两害相权取其轻，但又让自己陷入纠结、矛盾、焦虑或者抑郁之中，那你就要重新审视一下：这个选择对吗？我有能力去做出改变吗？

如果你自己没有答案，那这恰恰是你需要成长的一个点，你如果凭一己之力无法穿越，请及时求助专业的心理咨询师帮助。

你要清楚一点：我自身的问题，需要我自己去面对、去解决。

绝对不是“如果对方怎样怎样，我才能怎样怎样”，这种不合理的信念需要被打破，跳出受害者模式，你才可能做自己幸福的主宰。返回搜狐，查看更多

Abstract: Traditional attachment theory suggests that an individual’s attachment-related psychological and behavioral patterns are relatively stable. However, from information processes or life-span development perspective, attachment patterns have trait-state duality, i.e. attachment patterns are both relatively stable and context-sensitive. An individual’s attachment pattern in a particular context is the consequence of his or her trait attachment and contextual feature interactions. The interaction patterns between trait attachment and attachment priming effects provide a window to understand the duality of attachment and their relationships. And the two-stages model of attachment activation offers a framework for integrating and understanding these patterns. Future studies should optimize the manipulation check of attachment priming, meanwhile, take the interaction between attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety in consideration. More attention should be paid to the individual differences in the high attachment anxiety group which may clarify the patterns of interaction between trait and state attachment. Moreover, the time course of how attachment coping strategies impact the effects of attachment priming should be concerned, which could reveal the mechanism of the interactions between trait and state attachment.

# 亲密关系中的四种依恋风格全解析，回避？焦虑？_类型

他怎么好几天都没跟我联系？会不会和别人好上了？我要不要给他发个微信？可是凭什么他就不能主动联系？要不我找他朋友问问？......”

恋爱中的你遇到过类似状况吗？经常这样吗？为什么会这样呢？

其实，这正是焦虑倾向者的常见心理。本文我们就了解一下亲密关系中的四种依恋风格，看看自己属于哪一种，以及每种风格的特点和调整方法是什么。



一、依恋类型

依恋（attachment）这个概念，是上世纪六十年代英国心理学家鲍尔比（John Bowlby）提出来的，原本用来解释婴儿与养育者之间的情感联系。

1978年，他的学生Mary Ainsworth在此基础上提出了婴儿的三种依恋类型：安全型（Secure）、焦虑-矛盾型（Anxious-ambivalent）、回避型（Avoidant）。

后来研究者发现成年人在亲密关系中也有类似表现，且与幼儿时期的依恋模式基本一致。到1990 年，人际关系专家巴塞洛缪（Bartholomew）在婴儿的三种依恋类型的基础上，提出成年人的四种依恋类型。

这四种依恋类型是根据两个维度的变化区分出来的。一个维度是“回避”，一个维度是“焦虑”。高回避者与人亲密时容易感到不安，低回避者与人亲密时感觉轻松。高焦虑者害怕爱人不关注自己，或因为自己不够好而离开，低焦虑者则不担心这些。

两个维度高低组合出来的四种依恋风格是：安全型(Secure)、痴迷型(Preoccupied)、疏离型(Dismissing-Avoidant)、恐惧型(Fearful-Avoidant)。除了安全型，其它三种可以合称为不安全型。



二、依恋类型的影响因素、变化和分布

虽然存在先天因素的影响，但婴儿时期的照料模式是形成依恋类型的关键。养育者回应更敏感及时的，更容易发展成为安全型。养育者很少回应的，更容易发展成为不安全型。就算是天生的敏感易焦虑气质，经过养育者更多的注意和回应，一岁后也会表现得自信和安全感增加。

依恋类型在后天是可以变化的，不同时期可以表现出不同的风格。比如会受经历的影响。经历过感情失败的人，会本能地保护自己以免再次受伤，所以会向不安全型变化。

每个人的依恋类型不都是典型单一的，有的人是两种类型的交叉。甚至有人在两个维度上都居中，这样的情况不属于任何一种依恋类型。

就算同一个人，在不同时期和情境下，也有不同的类型表现。比如，有可能，面对自己喜欢的人表现出焦虑型。而面对不喜欢的人，就变成了回避型。

据调查分析，美国的安全型人数有50%，痴迷型为20%，疏离型为25%，恐惧型为5%。但亚洲地区的安全型不到50%，也就是说，在亚洲，不安全型的人更多。



三、四种类型详解

1、安全型（低回避、低焦虑）

可以很安心地与人亲密，并建立相互依赖又相互独立的关系。不担心被抛弃。对自己和他人的评价都是积极的，认为自己值得爱，他人也值得爱和信任。

2、痴迷型（低回避，高焦虑）

渴望与人亲密，又怀疑对方并不想和自己亲密，很担心失去，有强烈的情感依赖和饥渴。会做许多努力以获得关注和爱。对自己的评价消极，觉得自己低价值、不值得爱。总想努力得到他人的赞许，寻求认同。容易感觉被误解和不被重视，对别人的负面评价非常敏感，喜欢夸大负面信息，让自己更加焦虑。常处于怀疑、又爱又恨、拿不起放不下的矛盾中。人们常说的“作女”大多出现在这种类型。

3、疏离型（高回避、低焦虑）

回避亲密接触，难以信任和依赖对方，追求独立，因此容易让爱人陷入焦虑。对负面情绪和信息有回避倾向。往往在关系还没进展就开始退缩，觉得对方不可靠，亲近他们的企图会让他们紧张。他们对自己的评价是积极的，自认为有价值，觉得自己可以不需要依赖他人，因此不太在乎他人是否喜欢自己。他们希望和爱人保持清晰的边界，反对依靠。不需要对方为自己付出什么，因为他们也不打算有所报答。出现冲突的之后会拒绝一切沟通。他们在亲密关系中寻求的是个人的满足和期望。人们常说的不主动、不拒绝、不负责的“三不”男人，最容易出现在这种类型。

4、恐惧型（高回避、高焦虑）

内心期待亲密关系，但因害怕受伤，而表现出犹豫和抗拒。既想依赖又希望独立。这种对依赖的抵触是一种自我保护机制。对自己的评价较为消极，怕被拒绝，或担心自己离不开对方，因而避免和他人建立亲密关系。进入亲密关系之后，又担心被抛弃，时常感到恐惧。爱人不在身边时不安，爱人在身边又有点厌烦。在亲密关系中，希望有掌控感、自我价值的证明感，追求平静与轻松。

与爱人有冲突时，他们更喜欢以间接方式表达不满，如疏远冷淡。他们也容易做“爱的逃兵”，想做先放手的人，以此缓解内心的焦虑和被控制的感觉。对亲密关系既渴望又恐惧的心态，让他们表现得若即若离，总在亲密与疏远之间挣扎。因而，恐惧型最容易将自己陷入无序和混乱。



A、恐惧型和痴迷型的最大区别

痴迷型与恐惧型的人都容易焦虑，都常常担心被抛弃、被拒绝、被伤害，对爱人的情绪和行为非常敏感，会因为一句话一个眼神而感到不妥。

但他们在不安和焦虑时，有不同的表达方式：

痴迷型的人情绪表达直接。例如直接发脾气，过后可能会后悔，又主动讨好来缓解不安。

恐惧型的人情绪表达间接。他们会压抑和隐藏自己的真实感受，假装若无其事，只是变得疏远或冷漠。

B、恐惧型和疏离型的最大区别

疏离型与恐惧型的人都喜欢回避，都对亲密感到恐惧，不喜欢爱人依赖自己，对于爱人试图操控自己或侵犯私人边界的行为格外警惕。甚至，他们会对爱人总向自己倾诉而烦躁不安。

但区别是，他们的回避是否一以贯之：

疏离型的回避是一以贯之的。他们既不表达自己的情感，也不希望爱人对自己产生情感依赖。他们甚至不太关心关系的进展，更不会担心被抛弃。因此，常给人不坦诚、难以亲近的感觉。

恐惧型的回避则反复无常。感觉对方过度依赖就逃跑，但真的疏远时，又会焦虑，担心被抛弃。他们的疏远和冷漠，不仅为了逃脱控制，可能还有“被动攻击”目的。

C、恐惧型和疏离型的相近点

恐惧型和疏离型都是高回避型，都很需要私人空间，过于亲密的关系会让他们觉得被控制。他们随时处于防御状态，似乎可以随时抽离、关闭情感大门。

他们常压抑对亲密关系的需要，表面看起来很独立，哪怕爱人闹分手，也往往表现出无所谓的样子。

许多回避型依恋者有一个现象：一直在寻找爱情，却总是有始无终。他们总会在恋情进展到稳定阶段后，出现冷漠和退缩，想要逃避。有点儿像大家口中的“花花公子”。其实，那只是因为他们对亲密关系的不信任和自我保护。



四、如何调整

安全型的最理想。其它三种应该如何调整呢？

1、痴迷型

痴迷型的人要学会对自己负责。学会认识自己的价值，意识到自己是值得被爱和珍惜的。明白自己的价值不需要他人的认可，而应该由自己决定。不把尊严和掌控自己的权利交给别人。学会自我满足，把注意力放回自己身上。

学会客观地带有建设性地表达情绪和需求，而不是指责。比如：“你不回复我的信息，我感觉很不好，害怕失去你，下次能一有空就回我吗？”

设置自己的底线和原则，学会坚定和不轻易妥协。

2、疏离型、恐惧型

这两种都是回避型。要学会对爱人负责。学会表达爱，你的独立只是你没给自己表达爱的机会。学会表达心中的不安，而不是用不接电话、不回信息这样的冷漠方式去逃避。

因为成长记忆中的“羞耻感”是影响恐惧型依恋的重要因素。因此，可以试着去释放和表达那些被羞耻感所压抑的情绪。

比如，当对方不接自己电话的时候，你可以尝试着先对自己说出当下的感受：“他没接我的电话，这让我感到很担心。”而不是急忙压抑感受，疏远对方。

学会坦然地爱人以及被爱。要明白，人与人的靠近不可能完全无痛，但不像想象中那样危险。

如何与回避型的人相恋

回避型依恋者外表独立，其实内心没有安全感，害怕被不真诚地对待，所以，请对他们坦诚，不要故意说些拐弯抹角的话来考验他。

如果你的爱人是恐惧型依恋者，提醒自己，他变得冷漠是想表达焦虑不安，不要报复性地疏远，也别逼他亲近，要给他空间，让他感受到你会持续地存在于关系中。



以上。

只要亲密关系中的双方都有真诚的爱，由衷地愿意为关系的发展调整自己，无论是什么依恋风格的组合，都可以跨越隔阂，携手同行！返回搜狐，查看更多

基于生命早期经验形成的依恋心理和行为模式具有相对稳定性, 会对个体生命全程的人际关系、人格发展等产生深远影响是依恋理论的核心假设之一(Raby & Dozier, 2019)。但实证研究对这一观点提出了挑战, 纵向研究表明早期依恋模式与之后不同时期依恋模式的相关性较低(Fraley & Roisman, 2019)。同时, 社会认知研究发现个体依恋相关心理和行为会受当前情境影响, 暂时表现出不同于个体长期占主导地位的依恋模式的特征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016a, 2016b)。可见, 个体依恋心理和行为模式既有相对稳定性, 也有情境敏感性。换句话说, 情境中个体的依恋心理和行为特征处于稳定性和情境引致变化性的张力中, 如同路边的树, 没有风的时候指向其经年累月形成的固定方向, 风吹来, 树的朝向则会随风而变, 风一停止, 则又恢复到原来的朝向。

社会认知范式为研究情境对依恋的影响以及个体依恋特征与情境的交互作用提供了有效工具和新证据, 但个体依恋特征具有二重性的观点也见于传统依恋研究文献中。研究者遵循Bowlby (1969/1982)以及Ainsworth, Bell和Stayton (1972)强调依恋个体差异的传统, 将个体依恋特征视为一种具有跨时空、跨情境稳定性的特质。受此研究思路的影响, 依恋类型的划分、稳定性及早期依恋经验对个体之后各领域发展的影响等问题一直是依恋研究的焦点。但Bowlby (1969/1982, 1973)在论述依恋特征具有相对稳定性的同时, 也强调个体依恋系统具有情境敏感性, 即个体依恋系统受情境因素的影响而被激活或终止激活。但由于研究方法的限制, 直至最近20年, 依恋稳定性与情境敏感性问题才得到系统研究。研究者借鉴社会认知领域的相关理论和研究范式, 开始关注依恋个体差异背后的认知加工过程, 证实了个体依恋相关心理和行为特征会因情境作用表现出不同于个体长期依恋模式的状态性特征(Fraley, 2007; Gillath, Hart, Noftle, & Stockdale, 2009)。同时, 个体较稳定的依恋特征与依恋相关情境特征共同决定了个体在某一依恋情境中最终的心理和行为表现(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016a)。

个体心理和行为模式的稳定性和变化性问题始终是人格、自我领域关注的重要问题(Conway, Singer, & Tagini, 2004)。理解个体依恋特征既具有相对稳定性又具有情境敏感性, 以及个体稳定性依恋特征如何与情境交互作用共同影响个体在某一具体情境中的依恋表现, 有助于加深人们对个体如何应对情境中依恋刺激的理解, 以及对依恋行为在进化中适应意义的认识。本文首先将讨论个体依恋二重特征的定义及其在信息加工和个体发展中的表现, 继而梳理依恋启动研究中特质性依恋与依恋启动效应的交互作用模式, 最后以依恋系统激活两阶段模型对这些交互作用模式进行整合和解释, 以期助益于将来相关研究的开展。

依恋特征是由与依恋相关的知识、情绪、认知加工和行为等构成的集群(constellation)或模式(Fraley & Roisman, 2019)。学者分别使用“特质性依恋(trait attachment)”和“状态性依恋(state attachment)” 描述个体在依恋相关情境中表现出来的相对稳定的心理和行为特征和因情境刺激变化而暂时表现出的不同于个体稳定特征的暂时性特征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2017)。潜在状态-特质理论认为, 个体的心理和行为取决于个体特征, 情境特征和个体与情境的交互作用。同时, 个体在具体情境中的心理和行为特征会随情境变化而变化, 从这个意义上讲, 个体在某一情境中表现出的心理和行为特征均是状态性的(Steyer, Schmitt, & Eid, 1999)。按该理论, 个体在具体情境中表现出的依恋特征均是状态性依恋, 且状态性依恋特征是由个体特质性依恋特征、情境特征以及两者的交互作用决定的。以下将在“个体-情境”框架下, 从信息加工的视角对特质性依恋和状态性依恋进行界定和说明。

特质性依恋是个体依恋特征中具有相对稳定性和跨时空一致性的特征, 它反映了个体较长时间内依恋特征的平均水平。个体会在长期依恋互动经验中形成相对稳定的依恋表征和图式, 其中占主导地位的依恋图式会影响个体在某一情境中的依恋心理和行为。特质性依恋有助于个体避免陷于无序和混乱中, 对保持自我同一性和连续性十分重要, 同时该类特征有助于人们对依恋相关心理和行为进行解释和预测。在传统依恋研究中, 研究者多使用依恋类型对个体依恋行为特征进行描述和组织, 如陌生情景测验、Q分类法、故事完成测验、成人依恋访谈、当前关系访谈 (Ainsworth et al., 1972; Ainsworth, Bell, & Stayton, 1971; Bretherton, Ridgeway, & Cassidy, 1990; Crowell & Owens, 1996; Hazan & Shaver, 1987; Waters & Deane, 1985), 研究发现使用依恋维度描述个体依恋特征可能比采用依恋类型更具优势(Fraley, Hundson, Heffernan, & Segal, 2015), 常用测量依恋维度的工具包括亲密关系经历问卷和父母与同伴依恋问卷等(Armsden & Greenberg, 1987; Brennan, Clark, & Shaver, 1998)。但无论类型法还是维度法, 均假设个体存在稳定的依恋模式, 依恋模式作为一种特质具有跨时间和跨情境一致性, 且存在个体差异。个体依恋类型或依恋维度旨在捕捉个体在较长时间内、在不同情境下均会表现出的依恋特征。

状态性依恋是个体特质性依恋与其所处具体情境共同作用所表现出来的心理和行为特征。个体所处情境既包括外源性特征, 如情境中危险线索, 依恋对象的声音或照片等, 也包括内源性特征, 如个体回忆和心境等。因情境特征的复杂、多变, 状态性依恋常表现出不同于特质性依恋的特征。状态性依恋意味着个体嵌套于当前情境中, 个体的依恋反应是灵活且可修正的, 该类特征有助于个体适应当前环境。尽管Bowlby (1969/1982)提出依恋系统具有情境敏感性, 个体依恋特征并非静态、不变的, 但后来研究者仅将情境特征变化作为捕获个体特质性依恋的工具和方法, 如在陌生情境测验中, 研究者通过操纵情境(母婴分离和团聚)引发婴幼儿的依恋行为, 以对母婴依恋关系进行分类(Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978)。随着依恋研究中认知转向的出现, 研究者开始借鉴认知心理学的实验范式, 特别是启动范式, 对情境线索如何影响依恋相关心理和行为进行研究(Bryant & Bali, 2018; Gillath & Karantzas, 2018; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2017)。在依恋启动研究中, 研究者通过操纵刺激材料改变个体所处情境的特征, 探究个体特质性依恋与情境的交互作用。在依恋启动范式中, 启动效应是状态性依恋的表现或其发挥作用的结果, 研究者通过依恋启动效应可以深入了解状态性依恋。

传统社会和人格研究中, 常以“时间”作为特质性和状态性心理和行为划分的标准, 如Gillath等(2009)开发的成人状态依恋问卷(State Adult Attachment Measure, SAAM)即将依恋行为特征的持续时间作为区分特质性依恋和状态性依恋的标准。而本文对特质性依恋和状态性依恋的界定是从信息加工过程的角度进行的。特质性依恋反映了个体长期依恋特征的平均水平, 而状态性依恋因为情境的复杂、变化性, 常表现为对特质性依恋的暂时偏离。

依恋特征的二重性与信息加工中自上而下和自下而上两类加工过程密切相关。从信息加工的视角看, 个体在依恋相关任务中的表现, 既包含自上而下依恋表征驱动的加工过程, 也包括自下而上情境线索驱动的加工过程(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016b), 两者共同决定了个体最终表现出的心理和行为特征。个体生而具有的依恋系统会对当前依恋相关物理和心理线索和依恋对象可用性(availability)进行评估, 并结合内部工作模式设定个体当前依恋目标 (Bretherton, 1985)。依恋目标驱使个体在需要时向重要他人寻求亲密, 以减轻痛苦并保护自己免受威胁(Bowlby, 1969/1982, 1973)。个体最终表现出的依恋特征是由个体内部工作模式和当前情境特征共同决定的(Fraley, 2007; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016a)。个体内部工作模式具有相对稳定性, 但其所处的情境(如是否存在危险, 依恋对象是否在身边等)则是时刻变化的, 这决定了个体依恋在不同情境下既会表现出某些共同特征, 也会表现出情境特异性特征。

应注意, 尽管状态性依恋和纵向研究中的依恋可变性都强调“变化”, 但两者不可混为一谈。前者所强调的变化是指在某一具体情境中依恋特征的暂时性改变; 而后者则是指特质性依恋在较长时期内是可以变化的。从个体发展历程的角度看, 在一段时间内个体依恋模式具有相对稳定性, 而个体发展, 生活环境变化、新的依恋关系形成等均会在一定程度上改变个体原有的依恋模式(Feeney, 2016; Fraley, 2007)。这与Piaget (1954)提出的同化和顺应观点一致, 个体在与环境的交互中, 通过同化过程, 个体依恋模式得以保持相对稳定, 而通过顺应过程, 个体依恋模式又会发生变化, 同化和顺应过程交互作用塑造了个体的依恋模式。尽管传统依恋理论认为在发展过程中个体依恋模式具有相对稳定性(Fraley & Roisman, 2019), 但纵向研究发现儿童养育环境与其成年后的依恋模式平均相关效应值约为0.15 (Fraley, Roisman, Booth-LaForce, Owen, & Holland, 2013; Chopik, Moors, & Edelstein, 2014)。再者, 发展时期也是影响依恋稳定性的因素之一, 依恋模式发展的社会化-选择不对称模型(socialization- selection asymmetries)认为儿童依恋模式会表现出更高的变化性, 而成人则表现出更高的稳定性。

总之, 在个体发展过程中特质性依恋是可变的, 而在较短时间内个体依恋既会表现出相对稳定的特征也会表现出情境特异性特征。个体依恋模式的二重性体现了依恋在人类进化过程中的适应意义, 即为适应不断变化的环境, 个体依恋相关心理和行为需取得稳定性和情境敏感性的动态平衡。

尽管Bowlby (1969/1982)在依恋理论建构时就提出, 个体依恋行为具有情境敏感性, 但受研究方法的限制, 传统研究工具大多旨在测量个体的特质性依恋, 如陌生情境测验、Q分类法和故事完成测验等(Ainsworth et al., 1978; Bretherton et al., 1990; Waters & Deane, 1985), 并不能对状态性依恋及两者之间的关系进行研究。随着启动范式在依恋领域的应用, 研究者可以在同一任务中同时考察特质性依恋和状态性依恋的关系 (Birnbaum, Hirschberger, & Goldenberg, 2011; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Hudson & Fraley, 2018; Mikulincer, Hirschberger, Nachmias, & Gillath, 2001; Stupica, Brett, Woodhouse, & Cassidy, 2018)。研究者通常用依恋维度(依恋焦虑和依恋回避)和依恋类型反映特质性依恋, 用依恋启动效应反映状态性依恋或状态性依恋的结果。依恋启动效应按启动刺激效价可分为安全启动效应和不安全启动效应(Gabriel, Kawakami, Bartak, Kang, & Mann, 2010; Granqvist, Mikulincer, Gewirtz, & Shaver, 2012)。需要注意的是在启动条件下, 状态性依恋与依恋启动效应并不相同。在依恋启动范式中, (外源性和内源性)启动刺激会引起个体依恋特征的状态性改变, 而依恋特征的状态性改变可能影响与依恋并非直接相关的认知加工和行为, 如创造性问题解决、团体认同和抑郁症状等(Carnelley, Bejinaru, Otway, Baldwin, & Rowe, 2018; Mikulincer, Shaver, & Rom, 2011; Rosenthal et al., 2012)。启动刺激作用下, 个体表现出的不同于特质性依恋的、与依恋直接相关的信息加工过程和行为特征才属于状态性依恋。这种改变及由其引起的其他与依恋并非直接相关认知和行为的变化均属于依恋启动效应。这些与依恋并非直接相关的认知和行为的改变在一定程度上也可以反映个体状态性依恋, 因此个体依恋维度得分或依恋类型与依恋启动效应的交互作用为认识个体特质性依恋和状态性依恋的关系提供了窗口。

安全依恋启动通过向被试呈现与依恋相关的刺激(如依恋对象的名字或照片), 激活依恋安全基地(secure base)相关心理表征进而影响个体后续心理和行为反应。安全依恋启动效应与依恋焦虑存在不同的交互作用模式。有研究表明低焦虑个体更容易受安全依恋启动影响, 而高焦虑个体则不易受此影响。安全启动后低焦虑个体对共情记忆的通达性更高(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001), 情绪感受更积极(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018), 而在这些研究中均未发现安全启动对高焦虑个体的显著影响。但也有研究发现了与之相反的模式。安全启动可以增强高焦虑个体对依恋相关词汇的通达性(Gokce & Harma, 2018), 减少对创伤记忆的回忆(Bryant & Foord, 2016), 降低对应激和消极情绪的易感性(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Schoemann, Gillath, & Sesko, 2012), 以及提高共情水平(Cassidy, Stern, Mikulincer, Martin, & Shaver, 2018)。同时, 在人际互动层面, 高焦虑个体在安全启动后更倾向于维持关系, 更少解除关系, 对社会联结强度和关系多重性的评分更高(Gillath, Karantzas, & Selcuk, 2017), 并更少使用自我责备(self-blame)分手策略(Collins & Gillath, 2012)。以上研究均未在低焦虑个体中发现安全启动效应。

与上述发现类似, 安全依恋启动效应与依恋回避间也存在不同的交互作用模式。有研究发现, 低回避个体更容易受安全依恋启动影响。在个体水平, 对于低回避个体, 安全启动会提高其共情记忆的通达性 (Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001), 减少创伤记忆闯入(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Bryant & Foord, 2016), 增强情绪体验的积极性并降低压力易感性(Bryant & Bali, 2018; Bryant & Chan, 2017; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Schoemann et al., 2012)。在人际互动水平, 安全启动后, 低回避个体更倾向于寻求物质支持和精神支持(Gillath et al., 2006), 维持网络社交关系(Gillath et al., 2017)。但也有研究发现了相反的模式, 即高回避个体更容易受安全依恋启动效应影响。安全启动会降低高回避个体从遗憾中习得教训的感觉(Schoemann et al., 2012), 降低解除关系的倾向(Gillath et al., 2017), 降低其使用回避/退缩分手策略的倾向(Collins & Gillath, 2012), 并提高对他人需要的反应性(Mikulincer, Shaver, Sahdra, & Bar-On, 2013)。

此外, 安全依恋启动对依恋焦虑和依恋回避得分的影响也不同, 研究采用重复启动范式发现, 安全启动会降低个体焦虑维度得分, 而对回避维度得分无影响(Hudson & Fraley, 2018)。研究者还探究了依恋类型与安全依恋启动的交互作用。研究发现焦虑型个体更容易从安全启动中获益, 如安全启动后焦虑型个体对痛苦强度的评分更低(Pan, Zhang, Liu, Ran, & Teng, 2017), 更多向他人寻求安慰(Evraire, Ludmer, & Dozois, 2014), 而对其他不安全依恋类型个体甚至会产生消极影响, 如安全启动会提高恐惧型个体对痛苦强度的评分(Pan et al., 2017), 减少回避型个体向他人寻求安慰的倾向(Evraire et al., 2014)。此外, 其他因素也会调节两者间的交互作用, 如在非压力条件下, 安全启动可以提高恐惧型个体对抽象材料的喜爱程度, 而在威胁情境下, 则对其无显著影响(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001)。

不安全依恋启动可分为依恋威胁启动、依恋焦虑启动和依恋回避启动。威胁启动通过向被试呈现与依恋相关的威胁刺激(如分离相关图片、记忆等)影响个体依恋系统(Gabriel et al., 2010; Marks & Vicary, 2016; Rosenthal et al., 2012)。威胁刺激并未直接激活某一具体的依恋图式, 而是使依恋系统处于激活状态(Bretherton, 1985), 随后个体长期通达性最高的依恋表征或图式将被激活, 被激活图式或表征将驱动接下来的加工过程。依恋焦虑启动和回避启动则旨在激活与依恋焦虑和依恋回避相关的图式, 进而暂时改变个体当前依恋状态(Boag & Carnelley, 2016; Jarvinen & Paulus, 2017; Melen, Pepping, & O'Donovan, 2017)。

威胁启动效应与依恋焦虑和依恋回避之间均存在不同的交互作用模式。对于威胁启动效应与依恋焦虑的关系, 有研究发现, 威胁启动会影响低焦虑个体而不会影响高焦虑个体, 如威胁启动会降低低焦虑个体对浪漫性爱的渴望, 而对高焦虑个体的影响不显著(Birnbaum et al., 2011)。但也有研究发现, 威胁启动会影响高焦虑个体, 而对低焦虑个体则无影响, 如威胁启动会降低高焦虑个体对距离相关词汇的通达性(Marks & Vicary, 2016), 对抽象材料评分的积极程度(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001), 而在低焦虑个体中则无显著效应。对于威胁启动效应与依恋回避的关系, 有研究发现威胁启动会影响低回避个体而不会影响高回避个体, 如威胁启动会提高低回避个体对依恋对象名字的通达性(Mikulincer, Gillath, & Shaver, 2002), 而高回避个体则不然。也有研究发现了与之相反的模式, 威胁启动下男性回避水平越高其对伴侣照片的注意广度越大, 注意越不集中(Dewitte & Koster, 2014), 同时, 威胁启动会降低高回避女性的性欲望, 提高高回避男性的性欲望(Birnbaum et al., 2011), 而对低回避个体无影响。此外, 目标任务性质也会影响威胁启动与依恋回避之间的交互作用, 如个体对不同词汇的反应任务中, 威胁启动后回避水平越高个体对依恋对象相关词汇的通达性越低, 而对中性词和非词, 则不存在交互作用(Granqvist et al., 2012)。

除依恋维度外, 研究者还考察了威胁启动效应与依恋类型的交互作用, 但相关研究较少。研究发现在威胁启动条件下, 安全型个体反应更加开放和激进, 而不安全个体则更加保守, 如威胁启动后安全型个体更倾向于支持自由派候选人, 而不安全个体更倾向于支持保守派候选人(Weise et al., 2008)。此外, 目标任务性质和个体状态等会影响两者间的交互作用。对于目标任务性质, 在威胁启动条件下, 安全型、回避型和焦虑型个体对依恋相关词汇的通达性无差异; 而对于心理距离词汇, 焦虑型和安全型个体显著高于回避型个体。认知负荷也会影响两者的交互作用, 在低认知负荷条件下, 回避型个体对心理词汇的反应与安全型类似, 而在高认知负荷条件下, 回避型与焦虑型个体的反应均快于安全型个体(Mikulincer, Birnbaum, Woddis, & Nachmias, 2000)。

在不安全启动研究中, 对依恋焦虑启动与依恋回避启动与特质性依恋之间交互作用的研究相对较少, 但研究发现焦虑依恋启动与特质性依恋, 特别是与依恋焦虑存在交互作用。研究发现, 焦虑启动会提高低焦虑个体的进食量, 而对高焦虑个体无显著影响(Wilkinson, Rowe, & Heath, 2013)。再者, 依恋焦虑启动会降低高焦虑男性对亲密的渴望, 并使其在性幻想中的自我和他人表征更加消极(Birnbaum, Simpson, Weisberg, Barnea, & Assulin-Simhon, 2012)。值得注意的是, 有研究发现重复焦虑启动会降低高焦虑个体的焦虑水平(Hudson & Fraley, 2018)。这可能是因为该研究中焦虑启动采用了回忆叙事范式, 对消极关系的反思可能帮助焦虑个体修通其与亲密关系相关的负性信念和预期(Fredrickson, Cohn, Coffey, Pek, & Finkel, 2008)。此外, 焦虑启动可能会使回避型个体采用的抑制激活策略失效, 研究发现, 焦虑启动会提高高回避个体在共情情境下体验到的个人压力(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001), 这可能是因为回忆范式下要求回忆与亲密关系相关的消极记忆构成了额外威胁, 损害了其回避策略的使用(Mikulincer & Florian, 2001)。

尽管上述研究均稳健地表明, 特质性依恋与依恋启动引发的状态性依恋之间存在交互作用, 但也有许多研究表明无论在个体层面还是人际层面, 依恋二重特征的效应彼此独立, 即依恋启动效应独立于个体特质性依恋。在个体层面, 研究发现个体对威胁刺激的反应, 无论以心率、皮肤电活动还是以表情为指标, 安全依恋启动与依恋焦虑和回避维度均不存在交互作用(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Stupica et al., 2018), 且安全启动对反应抑制和挫折引起的情绪反应的影响也独立于依恋两维度(Karreman, Vingerhoets, & Bekker, 2019; Li et al., 2016)。同时, 安全依恋启动后, 个体在自传记忆回忆连贯性、具体性, 消极记忆闯入, 积极情绪通达性, 对挫折的情绪反应, 负性情绪管理中的表现均不受依恋维度的影响(Bryant & Bali, 2018; Bryant & Foord, 2016; Clear & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2017; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001)。而在人际互动层面也得到了一致结果, 关于浪漫嫉妒、网络攻击行为、偏见、人际应激、人格化策略、共情、帮助寻求和为他人提供帮助和支持等的研究均发现启动效应独立于个体特质性依恋(Bartz, Tchalova, & Fenerci, 2016; Gillath et al., 2006; Liu, Huo, Chen, & Song, 2018; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer et al., 2013; Pardess, Mikulincer, Dekel, & Shaver, 2014; Saleem et al., 2015; Selterman & Maier, 2013)。如对于他人需要的共情反应, 安全启动效应和特质性依恋分别独立挥发作用, 安全启动会增加个体在共情情境中自我报告的共情反应, 而依恋焦虑和回避会降低共情反应, 且两者之间不存在交互作用(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001)。

除安全启动的研究外, 不安全启动研究也发现特质性依恋与状态性依恋之间不存在交互作用。研究发现威胁启动会提高对依恋对象名字的通达性, 如母亲和离世的亲人, 且该效应独立于依恋焦虑和依恋回避(Carr & Landau, 2012; Mancini & Bonanno, 2012; Mikulincer et al., 2002)。再者, 压力启动会提高个体对亲近相关观念的通达性(Mikulincer et al., 2000)。此外, 关于个体对与上帝相关观念的认知开放性, 研究发现依恋焦虑启动、回避启动和安全启动与依恋回避和焦虑无交互作用(Jarvinen & Paulus, 2017)。可见, 无论安全依恋启动还是不安全依恋启动条件下均有研究发现依恋二重特征间不存在交互作用。

实证研究表明特质性依恋和依恋启动效应之间的关系模式十分复杂, 甚至存在方向相反的交互作用模式, 仅仅将这些不一致结果归因为误差显然并不合适。如何厘清这些复杂的结果, 并用同一理论框架进行解释, 有助于研究者对依恋二重特征的性质、功能及其之间的关系有更清晰、深入的认识。传统依恋理论主要包括两部分：(1)规范部分(normative aspect), 该部分主要是关于依恋系统及其发展的常态和普遍特征; (2)个体差异部分, 该部分主要是关于依恋系统运作的个体差异(Bowlby, 1969/1982)。与之对应, Mikulincer和Shaver (2016a)为解释情境刺激对个体依恋心理和行为的影响提出了依恋系统激活两阶段模型, 该模型为整合和解释上述复杂的交互作用模式提供了框架。

Mikulincer和Shaver (2016a)认为, 一旦个体评估发现情境中存在威胁, 依恋系统就会被自动激活, 该激活过程包括两个阶段。第一阶段, 威胁评估将导致依恋系统的潜意识激活, 并自动化地增强对依恋相关表征、想法和行为倾向的通达性。依恋系统激活的第一阶段与传统依恋理论中规范部分相对应, 该部分的核心观点是个体在感受到威胁时, 无论个体特质性依恋特征如何, 依恋系统均会被激活(Bowlby, 1969/1982)。不安全启动研究为该观点提供了证据, 研究发现在威胁启动或依恋焦虑和依恋回避启动条件下, 个体对依恋对象和亲近相关表征的通达性提高, 且该效应独立于依恋焦虑和回避维度得分(Carr & Landau, 2012; Jarvinen & Paulus, 2017)。既然依恋系统激活第一阶段的结果是激活依恋和亲密相关依恋表征, 提高其通达性, 那么直接激活这些依恋相关表征也应产生类似的效果。研究发现安全启动刺激会提高依恋相关表征的通达性 (Bryant & Bali, 2018), 抑制负性表征和负性情绪的激活, 提高情绪的积极性(Bryant & Foord, 2016; Clear & Zimmer- Gembeck, 2017)。这些被激活的积极表征和情绪将主导个体当前的心智状态, 使个体以更加积极、灵活和开放的方式应对威胁 (Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Stupica et al., 2018), 进行人际互动(Bartz et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Pardess et al., 2014; Saleem et al., 2015; Selterman & Maier, 2013)。无论是威胁刺激激活依恋系统, 提高亲密等依恋表征的通达性, 还是直接激活依恋安全相关表征, 两种方式均能对个体后续的心理和行为产生影响。尽管依恋理论的规范部分认为无论个体依恋特征如何, 个体在感知到威胁时依恋系统均会被自动激活, 但个体对情境刺激的评估可能受个体特质性依恋的影响, 所以Mikulicner和Shaver (2016a)认为该阶段依恋系统激活受过度激活和抑制激活依恋策略相关的兴奋性和抑制性环路影响。该观点也得到了实证研究的支持, 如威胁启动会提高低回避个体对依恋对象名字的通达性, 而对高回避个体无影响(Mikulincer et al., 2002), 还有研究发现, 威胁启动会降低高焦虑个体积极情绪激活, 而对低焦虑个体无影响(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001); 类似地, 研究发现安全启动可以提高低焦虑和低回避个体共情记忆的通达性, 而对高焦虑和高回避个体无影响(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001)。

第二阶段, 依恋相关心理表征的潜意识激活可以塑造个体当前的心理状态, 甚至在个体意识到之前影响个体的行为计划(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016), 并且这些被激活表征将唤起有意识的、与亲密寻求相关的想法, 主导个体接下来的活动, 并在很多情况下转化为寻求亲密和保护的可见行为。在该阶段个体基于依恋经验形成的特质性依恋将发挥更大作用, 换句话说, 该阶段依恋个体差异将表现得更加明显。特质性依恋与依恋启动效应表现出不同交互作用模式可能与具有不同特质性依恋特征个体偏好的依恋表征和策略有关。依恋安全个体(低焦虑和低回避)通常采用安全基地策略, 并表现出积极的信息加工和人际互动, 而高焦虑和高回避个体则分别偏好过度激活策略和抑制激活策略, 表现出消极的信息加工和人际互动(Dykas & Cassidy, 2011)。

依恋焦虑反映了个体在需要时重要他人可得的程度以及害怕被拒绝和抛弃的程度(Moura- Ramos, Santos, & Canavaro, 2017)。高焦虑个体通常使用过度激活策略, 表现为长期对依恋信息保持高度警觉, 并伴随强烈的忧虑且努力、强迫性地获得依恋对象的爱和支持(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016b)。无论个体依恋焦虑水平如何, 安全启动均可提高个体依恋基地相关表征和情绪通达性(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Gokce & Harma, 2018; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001)。但高焦虑个体依恋表征通达性通常处于较高水平, 故低焦虑个体相对高焦虑个体更容易表现出安全启动效应。再者, 安全启动条件下个体安全基地相关表征激活水平提高, 高焦虑个体将体验到更强的依恋安全感, 进而使其之后的认知和行为表现更加积极(Bryant & Foord, 2016; Cassidy et al., 2018; Schoemann et al., 2012)。而低焦虑个体依恋安全水平相对较高, 安全启动对其影响更小, 所以在这种情况下高焦虑个体更容易出现安全依恋启动效应。研究发现安全启动在高焦虑个体中会产生两种不同结果：(1)安全启动能够给高焦虑个体带来积极效应, 使其无论在信息加工还是人际互动中的表现更加积极、具有适应性(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Cassidy et al., 2018; Gillath et al., 2017; Gokce & Harma, 2018); (2)安全启动并不影响高焦虑个体的表现(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer et al., 2011)。产生以上两种不同结果可能是因为焦虑型个体的依恋表征网络内既包括与依恋安全、亲密相关的积极表征, 也包括不安全依恋相关的消极表征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007)。因此, 若安全启动刺激激活积极表征, 则会产生安全启动效应, 若安全启动刺激让被试联想到消极经验, 激活消极表征, 则个体不会表现出安全启动效应, 甚至产生消极影响(Mallinckrodt et al., 2013)。在不安全依恋启动, 特别是威胁启动条件下, 高焦虑个体感受到更高的不安全感, 此时个体将采用防御性策略应对威胁, 进而使得之后的认知和行为更加消极, 如情绪体验更加消极(Mikulincer, Hirschberger et al., 2001)。而低焦虑个体安全水平较高, 能够更加积极地应对威胁(Rosenthal et al., 2012), 更少表现出不适应性行为(Birnbaum et al., 2011)。值得注意的是, Hudson和Fraley (2018)研究发现重复焦虑启动会降低高焦虑个体的焦虑水平。这可能是因为研究采用回忆叙事范式, 对消极关系的反思可能帮助焦虑个体修通其与亲密关系相关的负性信念和预期(Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991; Fredrickson et al., 2008)。由此可推断, 在阈上条件下依恋不安全启动的效应在很大程度上取决于个体对启动刺激的主观评估, 这与Mikulincer和Shaver (2016)的观点一致。

依恋回避反映了个体努力维持行为独立及与重要他人维持情绪距离的程度(Moura-Ramos et al., 2017), 高回避个体倾向于使用抑制激活策略, 通过抑制依恋系统激活避免可能产生的痛苦(Dykas & Cassidy, 2011; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016)。当安全启动效应体现为提高个体依恋相关的认知和行为表现时, 低回避个体更容易表现出安全启动效应。低回避个体依恋安全感较高, 在安全启动条件下能够以更开放、积极的方式应对威胁、进行信息加工和人际互动(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Bryant & Foord, 2016; Gillath et al., 2017; Gillath et al., 2006; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer et al., 2011)。而高回避个体在面对威胁时, 通常采用抑制激活策略, 抑制对依恋相关刺激的通达性(Dewitte & Koster, 2014; Granqvist et al., 2012), 因此更不容易表现出安全启动效应。当安全启动效应体现为降低个体依恋相关消极行为时, 高回避更容易表现出安全启动效应(Collins & Gillath, 2012; Gillath et al., 2017; Mikulincer et al., 2013)。这可能是因为低回避个体通常能以积极的方式进行依恋相关的信息加工和人际互动, 消极行为相对较少, 因而更不容表现出安全启动效应。应注意, 高回避个体面对的“威胁”是经个体主观评价的结果, 即使客观刺激性质是安全的, 但若个体将其评价为威胁的, 也将驱使其采用抑制激活策略(Evraire et al., 2014)。但抑制激活策略并非在任何情境下均有效, 当该策略需要的认知资源被占用时就会失效, 研究表明该策略在低认知负荷下有效, 而在高认知负荷下则会失效(Mikulincer et al., 2000)。

综上, 安全启动效应主要体现在两个方面, 提高安全依恋个体依恋相关的适应性心理和行为表现, 降低不安全个体与依恋相关的消极认知和行为表现。而对于威胁启动, 依恋安全个体通常可以有效应对威胁刺激, 而高焦虑和高回避个体分别倾向于采用过度激活和抑制激活策略应对威胁。个体特质性依恋特征及启动刺激引起的状态性依恋特征共同影响了个体在具体情境中的表现。

个体在某一情境中表现出的依恋心理和行为是特质性依恋与情境引发状态性依恋相互作用、共同决定的。个体依恋模式处于稳定性与变化性之间张力的平衡中。依恋特征的二重性既保证了个体的同一性, 也使个体对环境的反应具有适应性。特质性依恋与依恋启动效应的多种交互作用模式为理解依恋二重性提供了实证证据, 依恋系统激活两阶段模型为理解、整合这些结果提供了框架。但在该领域仍然存在许多分歧和不足, 需要未来进一步研究。

当前采用依恋启动范式对于依恋二重性关系的研究存在的一个问题是大部分依恋启动研究未提供操作检验, 在这种情况下研究者更多通过结果事后推测依恋启动的有效性, 但并未提供直接证据证明依恋启动的有效性。这是因为操作检验可能引起被试对实验目的的猜测或降低本来就较弱的启动效应, 进而影响实验结果(Birnbaum et al., 2012)。Birnbaum等(2012)在研究中额外招募了一组被试只用于启动有效性的检验, 他们要求被试在启动完成后评价自己害怕被抛弃的程度, 结果表明焦虑启动组评分显著高于安全启动组。Schoemann等(2012)通过对被试在依恋想象启动任务中想象内容进行编码和分析确保被试进行了相应的想象, 但他们也未直接检验启动效应。Deng等(2016)通过实验组与控制组在完成启动任务后对当下感到安全、温暖、支持和想要给别人拥抱的程度的评分检验安全激活程度; 而Pan等(2017)通过启动前后的状态依恋问卷得分比较检验了启动效应。上述方法只可用于阈上依恋启动效应的操作检验, 不适用于阈下启动方法的检验。将来研究者应进一步优化阈上启动效应的检验方法, 同时发展适用于阈下启动效应的检验方法。

当前关于依恋二重性关系的研究多采用依恋焦虑和依恋回避两维度得分作为个体特质性依恋的指标。研究之所以多采用依恋维度描述个体特质性依恋是因其在某些方面更具优势(Fraley et al., 2015)。但当前依恋研究很多研究常分别对焦虑和回避进行单独分析, 而未考虑两者之间的交互作用(Gillath et al., 2015; Marks & Vicary, 2016; Mikulincer et al., 2014)。但有研究发现在依恋启动、依恋焦虑和依恋回避之间存在三者交互作用, 如Pan等(2017)发现对焦虑维度得分较高者, 若其回避维度得分高于一个标准差, 则安全依恋启动会降低其对痛苦图片的评分, 若其回避维度得分低于一个标准差则会提高其评分; 而低焦虑得分个体无论其回避维度得分如何, 均未发现启动效应。Schoemann等(2012)也发现了安全依恋启动与焦虑和回避间的三者交互作用, 安全启动可以降低高焦虑-低回避个体的遗憾感, 而对其他被试无显著影响; 同时安全依恋启动可以提高高焦虑-高回避个体通过错误学习的感觉, 而降低低焦虑-高回避个体通过错误学习的感觉, 并对其他类型的被试无显著影响。将来依恋启动研究中采用依恋维度测量个体特质性依恋时, 应考虑两维度间的交互作用。

目前研究中高焦虑与依恋启动效应存在不同的作用模式。有研究发现不安全启动会给高焦虑个体带来负面影响, 如降低情绪积极性和对同伴团体的认同等(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001; Rosenthal et al., 2012), 增加高焦虑个体的消极情绪体验(Mallinckrodt et al., 2013), 有研究

则表明高焦虑个体不受不安全启动的影响(Birnbaum et al., 2011), 甚至Hudson和Fraley (2018)发现重复焦虑启动会降低高焦虑个体的焦虑水平。这些不一致结果可能与焦虑型个体依恋表征的复杂性有关。焦虑个体的依恋表征可能是双效价的, 既有积极表征, 也有消极表征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007)。激活不同表征可能会产生不同结果, 将来研究应关注焦虑个体依恋表征的双效价性, 采用更具针对性的启动材料, 进一步揭示高焦虑与依恋启动效应产生不同作用模式的原因。

根据依恋系统激活的两阶段模型, 从激活依恋系统的刺激呈现至个体做出反应存在两个过程(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016)。第一阶段更多是自动化的, 而第二阶段个体特质性依恋将发挥更大作用。回避型个体倾向于采用抑制策略而焦虑型个体通常采用过度激活策略, 但这些依恋应对策略在信息加工中何时发挥作用仍不清晰。依恋策略是在个体对刺激进行评估时发挥作用, 还是在评估后做出反应时才发挥作用?未来研究应从信息加工时间进程角度对该问题进一步研究。此外, 依恋策略发挥作用是否需要意识参与也值得关注。研究发现阈下启动在创造性问题解决表现中, 启动效应独立于个体依恋特质性, 而在阈上启动条件下, 低焦虑个体表现出更高的创造性问题解决行为, 而对高焦虑个体无影响(Mikulincer et al., 2011), 这似乎说明个体意识参与是高焦虑个体的依恋策略发挥效用的条件, 这一问题也值得将来研究进一步关注。

忽远忽近、患得患失，敏感多疑，可能是焦虑型依恋在作祟……

​

 

依恋理论（Attachment theory）最早由英国心理学家John Bowlby所提出，指个体与具有特殊意义的他人形成牢固的情感纽带，提供安全感与安慰，具体可分为安全型、回避型、焦虑型、恐惧型四种。与儿童期的单纯依恋不同（婴儿-照料者），成人间的依恋关系显然更为复杂；不论是日常交友、与父母关系、与子女联结，或是亲密伴侣间的相处，都往往让人心生为难。似乎总有人是天生的社交牛人，可以游刃有余在各类关系间承担责任获得平衡，维持安全型依恋关系。也有一类人，心思细腻、敏感共情、缺少安全感、时而粘人，但同时又害怕被抛弃而故意主动回避，这就是典型的焦虑型依恋人格。

焦虑型依恋人格（anxious-resistant attachment）是指会在关系中极度渴望与对方建立亲密关系，发展稳定，但始终担忧与恐惧对方无法满足自己的期待，建立真正的关系。在这种焦虑下，总会认为自己是付出更多的一方，即使对方给出回应，也还是无法完全确定对方心意，幻想着、害怕着自己随时被抛弃的狼狈。

 

在亲密关系中，焦虑型依恋人格会有如下表现：

​

焦虑型依恋人群内心细腻，非常关注他人的情绪与表现，希望所有人可以舒适与满意，并会经常设身处地想象对方的想法与感受。因此，他们非常需要对方给到的反馈，“自己是否被接纳”、“自己是否让他人满意”、“自己表现是否得体”对他们是非常重要的话题。他们也会思考烦恼许多，纠结是保持自身特点还是迎合他人想法，但终是难以遵从本心，他们认为只有成为大家心中的样子，才不会孤身一人，合群、配合是他们牢记在心的事。

​

因为太害怕被放弃被抛弃，焦虑型依恋的人可能往往陷于自己的幻想，心生沮丧，而后产生嫉妒、气愤等一系列负面情绪，导致出现“粘人”的特质；但同时，他们又是天生的反思自省者，冷静过后，会认为自己是病态的疯狂的。于是会再次产生羞愧等情绪，开始选择回避。同时，他们害怕对方强烈的情感输出，逐步将自己封锁起来。在长期独处后，又会再次变得渴望被靠近，寻求亲密关系。长期往复，内耗不断，导致自己和对方越来越疲惫，形成恶性循环。

​

具有依恋型人格的人群常会在一段关系中，付出自己的所有，避免出现被责怪、被抛弃的结局。他们会在给对方很高评价的同时自我贬低，认为自己不够完美、自信心水平较低，认为自己做的还不够好，而后不断进行自我批评，不断强化这类不合理信念。因此，在这种情况下，他们非常需要关系中的另一方给出确认与肯定，以得到“自己是值得被爱的”、“自己是有长处的”、“自己是不可或缺的”。然而当对方给出的信号不够强烈时，他们可能会敏感、脆弱，甚至多疑失望。

除了上述特征外，此类人群可能还会出现：

- 追求完美

- 自我苛责

- 情绪波动起伏大

- 过度独立、过度依赖

- 关心照顾他人

- 很少表明自己诉求（希望对方猜中自身的心思）

- 害怕被批评

 

那么为什么ta/我是焦虑型依恋人格呢？

​

个体的气质与性格以及基因将会影响个体婴儿时期的表现与行为，如，有些婴儿在离开母亲时表现出高度焦虑、反复啼哭不止、有些表现的过度冷漠、又或者较为平淡。抚养者给予的关注强度与方式不同，就会强化不同的行为模式与内心信念，这些行为模式也会始终伴随个体的成长与发展，形成成年后的依恋模式。

在婴儿时期所形成的行为模式与信念又常与原生家庭中的照料者养育风格或抚养风格有关，焦虑型孩子的父母往往在与孩子相处时情绪波动较大，有时非常热情，给到孩子充足的陪伴、鼓励与爱意，但有时又会因为工作等外部压力影响，态度急转直下，时而冷淡、气愤、指责或是与孩子距离逐渐变远。让孩子们产生矛盾感，想要不断确认自己究竟是否被父母爱着，自己的表现究竟如何，导致在情绪上渴求、索取的越来越多。

是否在童年或成长阶段中经历过被抛弃、是否在某段关系中被伤害等可能会使得个体产生恐惧心理，害怕重蹈覆辙，导致焦虑依恋人格形成。以伴侣亲密关系为例，独自一人时，渴望得到另一人的关注与爱意，但是一旦确立关系后，又渴望对方满心满眼皆是你，同时，在被爱着时又担心自己不够完美，焦虑是否又会被舍弃，一边害怕，一边紧攥。

 

​

​

​

依恋类型虽在儿童时期就会得到确立，但也会根据人的成长经历与个人心理信念更替而不断发展，因此，依恋模式并非是一成不变的，如果你或者身边的ta恰巧也是焦虑型依恋人格，可以从以下方面做出调整：

认识自己的情绪状态，不让瞬间的悲伤、气愤逐步放大并支配自身，当你发现自己或者对方快要失控时，请尝试停下来冷静的帮助自己或对方感知情绪并反思，它从何而来，为何突然袭来，往往情绪过激的背后并不是真正的指责或厌恶，只是单纯渴求安全感与爱意。

调整自己的沟通模式，告诉对方自己的真实想法，坦诚告诉对方你所在意或渴望被满足的需求，减少让对方猜测的机会。说出你在焦虑什么、为何会焦虑、自己做出了哪些努力、希望对方理解哪些部分，告知对方你的期待会让自己和他人更为轻松与安全。如果对方无法满足，也请别责怪自己，也许只是因为ta和你不够适合陪伴彼此。

积累他人对你的爱意、积累他人对你的肯定、积累自己的正向评价、积累自己的开心瞬间，当焦虑袭来时，可以开始回想生活中的美好，给到自己力量与正向暗示，为自己赋能。

也许，帮助自身或者帮助他人偶尔力不从心，请不用担心，你可以寻求心理咨询等专业人员帮助，抽丝剥茧，认识到行为情绪背后所有的触发事件，更好认识自身的潜意识，并提供更为高效专业的方案帮助我们度过纠结、减少痛苦、勇敢促使自身、陪伴他人走出困境，做出改变。

# 安全型恋人：需要你，但又没那么需要你-虎嗅网

扫码打开虎嗅APP

本文来自微信公众号：简单心理 （ID：jdxl2000），作者：寒冰，责编：kuma，原文标题：《“安全型恋人”的7个特点》，题图来源：《没关系，是爱情啊》



这几年依恋模式被越来越多人熟知，渐渐成了大家理解亲密关系的一个新视角，“怪不得我们在关系里总是你追我逃，一个焦虑一个回避”；很多人嘴里的渣男/渣女，也可能只是不安全依恋。



与此同时，“安全型恋人”成了大家渴望的香饽饽。



他们有能力依赖他人，同时保持独立，可以根据需要与其他人走近或远离。甚至还会制造一种缓冲效应，在一定程度上帮助非安全型伴侣提升恋爱满意度，走向更安全的依恋。



但很多人会困惑：“只听说过，没有见过，如何识别安全型恋人？”“安全型到底什么意思？”“我是个小焦虑，想往安全型发展，应该怎么做呢？”



今天这篇文章我们就来聊聊安全型依恋常见的 7 个特点。



一、最大的特点是在关系里状态稳定，而稳定的背后是安全感



相比较不安全依恋模式（焦虑、回避都可以称为不安全依恋），安全型依恋最突出的特点在于“状态稳定”：



他们不会突然消失，忽近忽远，也不太会变得格外粘人。他们可以接受关系是有弹性的，过于亲密或者过于疏远都不太容易触发他们的“警报”。



他们也比较少接受伴侣的“投射”——指伴侣对他们发动攻击、指责时，他们不太会被卷入这样的评价，将关系的冲突升级。就好比当伴侣的世界掀起“狂风骤雨”，他们依然像一棵树站立在那里，不会轻易被摧毁。



而这背后是他们内心相对充足的安全感，不管是对关系的，还是对自身的。贝内德克（Benedek，1938）称之为“有信心的关系”，克莱茵（Klein，1948）称之为“好客体的内投”，而埃里克森（Erikson，1950）则称之为“基本信任”。



因此，依恋的安全性往往也和一个人的心理健康直接相关。



二、他们也并非完美伴侣，但能够提供“足够好”的情感支持



很多人对不安全依恋的诟病都是，他们无法提供很好的情感支持——需要他们的时候，他们可能跑了，或者先崩溃了。



但安全型依恋也并不意味着他们是完美伴侣，可以百分之百满足你的需求，实际上，他们能够提供的是“足够好”的情感支持。



“足够好”（Good Enough）这个概念最初来自温尼克特，它的意思是养育者不需要做到满分，60 分就能养出一个基本安全健康的孩子。



具体到亲密关系里，“足够好”的情感支持可能意味着：



可靠、安全、一致（类似上文所说的“稳定”）；



对伴侣的需求足够敏感，并且愿意满足伴侣的需要（而非视而不见）；



能够谈论彼此的需求；对于无法满足的部分，双方可以沟通。



而发展安全依恋的基础，通常是他们童年有一个“足够好”的养育者。不少研究都发现成年人的安全依恋受到童年时期与养育者关系的影响（Brennan et al，1998），他们被好好对待过，如今也能好好去爱别人。



三、在关系之外也有健康的人际关系支持，不把伴侣作为亲密和情感的唯一来源



“伴侣无法满足我们所有的需求”，安全型恋人们深知这一点，所以他们通常在关系之外也有健康的人际关系支持，不把伴侣作为亲密和情感的唯一来源。



因而作为伴侣的一方也不会有太大压力，“他们需要你，但又没那么需要你”。



事实上，这样也使得亲密关系质量更好：研究发现当拥有“重要他人”时，人们反而有更多自我扩展的机会，给关系注入新奇和活力，促进了长期的满足感（Tsapelas， 2009）。



反过来，当伴侣是一方唯一的亲密和情感来源时，这样的关系会变得脆弱，他们可能无法承受关系的任何波动，当关系结束时，造成的打击是毁灭性的。“你是这个世界上唯一对 ta 重要的人”，并不是一种爱情的甜蜜宣言，反而可能是危险的信号。



四、能作为“容器”为伴侣提供情绪调节，反之亦如此



情绪调节能力也是安全型恋人一个非常突出的特征。他们能好好处理自己的情绪，也能作为“容器”为伴侣提供情绪调节。



比如：



对自己和伴侣的情绪很敏感，伴侣不必为了引起他们的注意而使得情绪升级，比如发脾气、冷战等等；



能帮助伴侣验证情绪，接纳伴侣的情绪；



他们不觉得负面情绪是糟糕的，将其视为亲密的机会；



更能理解负面情绪，会尝试和伴侣一起解决情绪的问题。



反之亦如此，他们也期待伴侣能帮忙调节自己的情绪，所以他们有情绪时会表达，不以破坏性的方式宣泄情绪。



这种能力从哪里来？情绪调节并不是一个人的事，它是在关系中形成的，往往需要另外一个人和我们互动，小时候通过父母的验证、肯定、参与，我们逐渐理解自己的情绪，学习处理情绪。



如果没有拥有过这样的“容器”，人们就会在情绪调节方面遇到一些困难，也很难成为他人的“容器”。



五、能离开伴侣去探索自己的世界，也允许和鼓励伴侣去探索他们的世界



依恋模式理论中有个概念叫“安全基地”，你可以想象这样一个画面：



小朋友学会走路后，妈妈留在原地，不远处有玩具，小朋友会走过去，ta 不时地回头看看妈妈，确认妈妈在那里，小朋友就会很安心。当 ta 知道妈妈就在不远处，需要的时候会出现，就能放心地去探索新的世界了。



这个时候，妈妈对小朋友来说就是一个“安全基地”。



同理，长大后亲密关系里伴侣也会成为新的“安全基地”。对于安全型恋人来说，他们能信任安全基地的存在，因此很容易能离开伴侣去做自己的事，不用回头时时确认。同样，当他们的伴侣走出去时他们也不担心，因为知道伴侣会回来，所以他们也非常鼓励和欢迎伴侣去探索自己的世界。



有时互相依偎，感受亲密；有时各自独立，自由玩耍，一段好的关系反而能让人们更有力量脱离这段关系。



如果“安全基地”是不可靠的，人们就很难离开。就像上述场景中，小朋友一回头妈妈就不在了，他们会哭着开始找妈妈，诱人的玩具也很难吸引他们了。



六、灵活的界限：不会太僵硬，也不会太松散



界限是任何关系中都很重要的部分，是自我关爱的根本。但由于情感和生活的过于紧密，很多人不知道如何处理亲密关系中的界限。



不妨来看看界限常见的三种类型，也分别对应了不同的依恋模式：



1. 松散的界限，常见于焦虑型恋人



过度分享



过度相互依赖，情感纠缠（与他人之间缺乏情感分离）



很难说“不”；取悦他人



被拒绝就六神无主



容易接受虐待



2. 僵硬的界限，常见于回避型恋人



很少分享



很难暴露自己的脆弱，很难提需求



对他人有很高的期望



容易把别人拒之门外；内心仿佛筑起一道围墙



3. 健康的界限，常见于安全型恋人



明确自己的价值观，有清晰的界限，也能尊重别人的界限



能倾听内心的声音，相信自己的感受



适当地与人分享



适当示弱



能坦然拒绝别人，不含敌意；也能坦然接受被拒绝



你可能也发现了，对安全型恋人来说，界限的关键在于某种弹性，不能太松散，也不是僵化不可动。他们有自己的坚持，也能尊重和理解另一个人的不同。健康的界限让他们在个人和关系之间达成某种平衡。



七、他们深知自己值得被爱，也更倾向于选择能满足自己需求的关系



电影《涉过愤怒的海》中，李苗苗为了证明对小娜的爱，拔掉自己的牙齿、扔掉小娜的鞋子。很多人可能遇见这种情况就吓跑了，但小娜没有，在她看来，这反而是一种浓烈的爱的证据。



现实生活中大多数人不会这么极端，但还是有一些“无法建立一段健康关系”的信号，比如在关系中阴晴不定、善于逃避、不忠诚、暴力倾向等等，遇见这样的人，安全型恋人会失去兴趣。因为他们深知自己渴望被爱，也值得被爱，也相信周围有很多的潜在恋人，会接纳自己的亲密，满足自己的需求。



《关系的重建》中，作者访问了很多不同依恋模式的人群，一位安全型依恋的受访者（Tanya，28岁，女性）分享了她对伴侣的选择：



“和男生约会时，我只对不玩把戏的异性感兴趣，这是我的基本原则。我们约会之后，那些男人在第二天立马打电话给我，最晚也会在第二天晚上联系我。而作为回报，我也会在一开始就明确表示自己的意向。有生以来，我只经历过两位男性事隔几天后才联系我，我立马将他们排除在了考虑范围之外。”



你可能也注意到了，Tanya 面对那些对自己的亲密需求没有进行足够回应的男人，没有浪费一点儿时间。她恋爱原则中非常重要的一点在于，她认为那些对她不够尊重的人，没有能力在恋爱中给予她足够回应的人，是不值得她付出的。



而 Tanya 如果是焦虑型依恋，很容易会将对方的不联系，归咎于自己的约会表现不好，她可能会审视自己的行为，不断地怀疑自己，甚至一而再再而三地将机会留给错的人。



好吧，看到这里不知道你是对安全型恋人充满期待， 还是对自己感觉有些沮丧。



事实上，依恋模式并不是我们能选择的，它很大程度上是基于过往的关系模式，负面的关系经历往往会造成不安全的依恋。这个时候，建立一种健康、安全的关系可能并不是一件容易的事，人们往往需要大量的（好的）经验才能逐渐修正对整个世界的理解（Gillath et al， 2008）。



但改变依然是有可能的。



研究发现，人们找到新的依恋对象，如亲密的朋友、伴侣、治疗师或导师，并与他们建立健康的关系，就有可能展出安全的依恋风格（Saunders et al.， 2011）。现在的很多伴侣治疗方法比如情绪聚焦疗法（EFT）（Johnson，2019），也会帮助夫妻体验彼此安全依恋的时刻，从而建立更健康的关系。



愿你有机会好好被对待，也能好好去爱。

# 亲密关系中的识别情绪模式 | 你是哪种“依恋类型”？ • 6秒钟情商官网

 由 Huang, Chamie | 7 月 3, 2020 | 6秒钟, 生活情商 | 0 条评论

每个人都有一些“好模式”和“坏模式”，如果我们不想一次又一次地重复同样的错误，首先要做的就是意识到“问题出在哪里”。本篇文章帮助我们探索自己在亲密关系中的模式，并了解这些模式是如何影响着我们建立和打破关系。

伴侣之间有时会发生争吵，虽然这种场景不常发生，但每一次都很伤人。

妻子回家发现家里有几处衣服，于是抱怨了一句：“你为什么每次都把衣服乱扔！？”，两个人开始为此进行对话，在你一言我一语的过程中，和“反抗”相关的模式被激活，为了证明自己才是对的那一个，对话升级为争吵。

丈夫可能因此被压得喘不过气来，需要独处才能回到安全和爱的状态。妻子可能因此委屈地哭泣，继续不断地诉说，需要一个肯定回应才能安定心神。

依恋类型 Attachment Style

“依恋类型”这个概念最早是由英国精神病学家鲍尔比(John Bowlby，1969)提出的，他将依恋定义为“个体与具有特殊意义的他人形成牢固的情感纽带的倾向，能为个体提供安全和安慰”。

鲍尔比最早提出依恋这个概念主要是用来解释婴儿与其养护者之间的情感联系，但后来的研究者们将之扩展到了成人之间。

现在依恋(Attachment)主要指：个体与主要抚养者发展出的一种特殊的、积极的情感纽带，也是指个体寻求并企图与另一个体在身体和情感上保持亲密联系的倾向。

阅读以下描述，看看你属于三种类型中的哪种依恋类型？

◈ 焦虑（对抗）型 Anxious-resistant

你需要从伴侣那里得到许多关注才能感觉到被爱。你经常会有一种“距离感”，你可能讨厌带着愤怒说晚安，你需要先解决争吵，才能再次感到“完整”。可能表现的比较“黏人”或“需要帮助”。

◈ 安全型 Secure

你乐于给予和接受关注，与对方距离太远或太近时，你都意识到，然后会要求更多的空间或更多的关注来让自己感到舒服。你认定的事情不会因他人的行为而受到影响。

◈ 回避型 Avoidant

你非常重视独立和个人空间，可能不太愿意给予或接受感情。当一段感情开始后，你很快就会意识到这需要你放弃独立，所以可能难长时间维持一段感情。你可能会听到他人评价你有些自私或冷漠。

在这些描述中，你认出自己和伴侣了吗？每个依恋类型都会有相似的一些“模式”，而在亲密关系中，每个人也可以通过脱离自动驾驶模式，有意识地选择或改变自己的模式，来更好的支持彼此。

接下来，一起看一些故事和例子吧。

 

焦虑对抗型 vs 回避型 

在争论期间，回避型Andy想要独处的空间，而焦虑对抗型Judy却想要在一起。花了一段时间，他们终于认识到双方的不同模式。当Andy发现自己不知所措时，他想找到最近的出口，独处一段时间。而Judy感到难过时，希望自己可以更多的被关注和照顾。Andy和Judy共同讨论两人的模式，并运用同理心去理解对方的观点，他们商量出一个共同的策略。

当他们吵架时，Andy会有一段自己的时间，可以是30分钟，3个小时，一天……但需要事先告知Judy。时间到了后，Andy会充满能量的回来。而Judy知道了Andy的独处时间是多久，她会因此感到安全。在这段时间里，她能够专注于自己，比如与家人聊天、和朋友逛街等。Judy也会轻轻地提醒Andy，他们有一个共同的约定。在这种情况下，他们两个互相满足了对方的需求。

回避型 vs 回避型 

Lucy和Peter都是回避型的依恋类型，很多时候他们都宁愿一个人呆着。尽管他们都非常重视稳定以及家人关系，但他们很容易忘记保持良好的关系需要一些情感上的工作。于是他们发现双方的模式后，共同讨论了一个策略。

他们每周安排一次时间，以情侣的身份进行连接。他们共同撰写了一份文件，表达对方自己有多重要，在争论之后回看这份文件。除此之外，他们优先考虑各自的独处时间，有时也会利用这个时间来表达对彼此的爱。Lucy会为Peter写爱情日记，而Peter则会用心为Lucy挑选礼物。为了避免自己忽略对方的需求和感受，他们还找到了可信赖的咨询师来支持他们。他们虽然都是回避型，但也可以通过一起学习，相互支持，来体会爱这样一件美好、安全的事情。

焦虑对抗型 vs 焦虑对抗型 

John和Jane都是焦虑对抗型，平时他们甜蜜得似胶如漆，彼此间充满爱意。于是在争执时，他们都会希望得到对方的关注。但驾驭情绪对于同样是焦虑型的Jane和John，都很挑战，因此，为了更好地谈论和验证情绪，他们也共同制定了一个策略。

一旦有谁感到受伤，先准确地表达自己的感受，而不是使用置气、抱怨的方式进行交流，此时另一方需要表达爱、安全和谅解。这样不仅能共同满足彼此的需求，他们也体会到爱不一定是要每时每刻在一起，独处时也可以从自己的内心感受到爱与支持，并再稳定地给予对方。

不论是什么依恋类型，也不论是什么样的模式，建立长期幸福关系的技巧很简单：确保满足每个人的需求。识别情绪模式也不是为了改变，而是更有意识地选择更合适的回应。

那么，你在亲密关系中是属于哪种依恋类型？你的伴侣呢？针对你们相处的模式，可以共同制定什么样策略来让彼此的感情更为长久和稳定？

# 亲密关系中的四种依恋风格全解析，回避？焦虑？_类型


                        由内容质量、互动评论、分享传播等多维度分值决定，勋章级别越高(
                        
                        )，代表其在平台内的综合表现越好。
                    

他怎么好几天都没跟我联系？会不会和别人好上了？我要不要给他发个微信？可是凭什么他就不能主动联系？要不我找他朋友问问？......”

恋爱中的你遇到过类似状况吗？经常这样吗？为什么会这样呢？

其实，这正是焦虑倾向者的常见心理。本文我们就了解一下亲密关系中的四种依恋风格，看看自己属于哪一种，以及每种风格的特点和调整方法是什么。



一、依恋类型

依恋（attachment）这个概念，是上世纪六十年代英国心理学家鲍尔比（John Bowlby）提出来的，原本用来解释婴儿与养育者之间的情感联系。

1978年，他的学生Mary Ainsworth在此基础上提出了婴儿的三种依恋类型：安全型（Secure）、焦虑-矛盾型（Anxious-ambivalent）、回避型（Avoidant）。

后来研究者发现成年人在亲密关系中也有类似表现，且与幼儿时期的依恋模式基本一致。到1990 年，人际关系专家巴塞洛缪（Bartholomew）在婴儿的三种依恋类型的基础上，提出成年人的四种依恋类型。

这四种依恋类型是根据两个维度的变化区分出来的。一个维度是“回避”，一个维度是“焦虑”。高回避者与人亲密时容易感到不安，低回避者与人亲密时感觉轻松。高焦虑者害怕爱人不关注自己，或因为自己不够好而离开，低焦虑者则不担心这些。

两个维度高低组合出来的四种依恋风格是：安全型(Secure)、痴迷型(Preoccupied)、疏离型(Dismissing-Avoidant)、恐惧型(Fearful-Avoidant)。除了安全型，其它三种可以合称为不安全型。



二、依恋类型的影响因素、变化和分布

虽然存在先天因素的影响，但婴儿时期的照料模式是形成依恋类型的关键。养育者回应更敏感及时的，更容易发展成为安全型。养育者很少回应的，更容易发展成为不安全型。就算是天生的敏感易焦虑气质，经过养育者更多的注意和回应，一岁后也会表现得自信和安全感增加。

依恋类型在后天是可以变化的，不同时期可以表现出不同的风格。比如会受经历的影响。经历过感情失败的人，会本能地保护自己以免再次受伤，所以会向不安全型变化。

每个人的依恋类型不都是典型单一的，有的人是两种类型的交叉。甚至有人在两个维度上都居中，这样的情况不属于任何一种依恋类型。

就算同一个人，在不同时期和情境下，也有不同的类型表现。比如，有可能，面对自己喜欢的人表现出焦虑型。而面对不喜欢的人，就变成了回避型。

据调查分析，美国的安全型人数有50%，痴迷型为20%，疏离型为25%，恐惧型为5%。但亚洲地区的安全型不到50%，也就是说，在亚洲，不安全型的人更多。



三、四种类型详解

1、安全型（低回避、低焦虑）

可以很安心地与人亲密，并建立相互依赖又相互独立的关系。不担心被抛弃。对自己和他人的评价都是积极的，认为自己值得爱，他人也值得爱和信任。

2、痴迷型（低回避，高焦虑）

渴望与人亲密，又怀疑对方并不想和自己亲密，很担心失去，有强烈的情感依赖和饥渴。会做许多努力以获得关注和爱。对自己的评价消极，觉得自己低价值、不值得爱。总想努力得到他人的赞许，寻求认同。容易感觉被误解和不被重视，对别人的负面评价非常敏感，喜欢夸大负面信息，让自己更加焦虑。常处于怀疑、又爱又恨、拿不起放不下的矛盾中。人们常说的“作女”大多出现在这种类型。

3、疏离型（高回避、低焦虑）

回避亲密接触，难以信任和依赖对方，追求独立，因此容易让爱人陷入焦虑。对负面情绪和信息有回避倾向。往往在关系还没进展就开始退缩，觉得对方不可靠，亲近他们的企图会让他们紧张。他们对自己的评价是积极的，自认为有价值，觉得自己可以不需要依赖他人，因此不太在乎他人是否喜欢自己。他们希望和爱人保持清晰的边界，反对依靠。不需要对方为自己付出什么，因为他们也不打算有所报答。出现冲突的之后会拒绝一切沟通。他们在亲密关系中寻求的是个人的满足和期望。人们常说的不主动、不拒绝、不负责的“三不”男人，最容易出现在这种类型。

4、恐惧型（高回避、高焦虑）

内心期待亲密关系，但因害怕受伤，而表现出犹豫和抗拒。既想依赖又希望独立。这种对依赖的抵触是一种自我保护机制。对自己的评价较为消极，怕被拒绝，或担心自己离不开对方，因而避免和他人建立亲密关系。进入亲密关系之后，又担心被抛弃，时常感到恐惧。爱人不在身边时不安，爱人在身边又有点厌烦。在亲密关系中，希望有掌控感、自我价值的证明感，追求平静与轻松。

与爱人有冲突时，他们更喜欢以间接方式表达不满，如疏远冷淡。他们也容易做“爱的逃兵”，想做先放手的人，以此缓解内心的焦虑和被控制的感觉。对亲密关系既渴望又恐惧的心态，让他们表现得若即若离，总在亲密与疏远之间挣扎。因而，恐惧型最容易将自己陷入无序和混乱。



A、恐惧型和痴迷型的最大区别

痴迷型与恐惧型的人都容易焦虑，都常常担心被抛弃、被拒绝、被伤害，对爱人的情绪和行为非常敏感，会因为一句话一个眼神而感到不妥。

但他们在不安和焦虑时，有不同的表达方式：

痴迷型的人情绪表达直接。例如直接发脾气，过后可能会后悔，又主动讨好来缓解不安。

恐惧型的人情绪表达间接。他们会压抑和隐藏自己的真实感受，假装若无其事，只是变得疏远或冷漠。

B、恐惧型和疏离型的最大区别

疏离型与恐惧型的人都喜欢回避，都对亲密感到恐惧，不喜欢爱人依赖自己，对于爱人试图操控自己或侵犯私人边界的行为格外警惕。甚至，他们会对爱人总向自己倾诉而烦躁不安。

但区别是，他们的回避是否一以贯之：

疏离型的回避是一以贯之的。他们既不表达自己的情感，也不希望爱人对自己产生情感依赖。他们甚至不太关心关系的进展，更不会担心被抛弃。因此，常给人不坦诚、难以亲近的感觉。

恐惧型的回避则反复无常。感觉对方过度依赖就逃跑，但真的疏远时，又会焦虑，担心被抛弃。他们的疏远和冷漠，不仅为了逃脱控制，可能还有“被动攻击”目的。

C、恐惧型和疏离型的相近点

恐惧型和疏离型都是高回避型，都很需要私人空间，过于亲密的关系会让他们觉得被控制。他们随时处于防御状态，似乎可以随时抽离、关闭情感大门。

他们常压抑对亲密关系的需要，表面看起来很独立，哪怕爱人闹分手，也往往表现出无所谓的样子。

许多回避型依恋者有一个现象：一直在寻找爱情，却总是有始无终。他们总会在恋情进展到稳定阶段后，出现冷漠和退缩，想要逃避。有点儿像大家口中的“花花公子”。其实，那只是因为他们对亲密关系的不信任和自我保护。



四、如何调整

安全型的最理想。其它三种应该如何调整呢？

1、痴迷型

痴迷型的人要学会对自己负责。学会认识自己的价值，意识到自己是值得被爱和珍惜的。明白自己的价值不需要他人的认可，而应该由自己决定。不把尊严和掌控自己的权利交给别人。学会自我满足，把注意力放回自己身上。

学会客观地带有建设性地表达情绪和需求，而不是指责。比如：“你不回复我的信息，我感觉很不好，害怕失去你，下次能一有空就回我吗？”

设置自己的底线和原则，学会坚定和不轻易妥协。

2、疏离型、恐惧型

这两种都是回避型。要学会对爱人负责。学会表达爱，你的独立只是你没给自己表达爱的机会。学会表达心中的不安，而不是用不接电话、不回信息这样的冷漠方式去逃避。

因为成长记忆中的“羞耻感”是影响恐惧型依恋的重要因素。因此，可以试着去释放和表达那些被羞耻感所压抑的情绪。

比如，当对方不接自己电话的时候，你可以尝试着先对自己说出当下的感受：“他没接我的电话，这让我感到很担心。”而不是急忙压抑感受，疏远对方。

学会坦然地爱人以及被爱。要明白，人与人的靠近不可能完全无痛，但不像想象中那样危险。

如何与回避型的人相恋

回避型依恋者外表独立，其实内心没有安全感，害怕被不真诚地对待，所以，请对他们坦诚，不要故意说些拐弯抹角的话来考验他。

如果你的爱人是恐惧型依恋者，提醒自己，他变得冷漠是想表达焦虑不安，不要报复性地疏远，也别逼他亲近，要给他空间，让他感受到你会持续地存在于关系中。



以上。

只要亲密关系中的双方都有真诚的爱，由衷地愿意为关系的发展调整自己，无论是什么依恋风格的组合，都可以跨越隔阂，携手同行！返回搜狐，查看更多

# 你对恋人的依恋 属于哪种类型？_人际关系



人际关系受到我们经历和经验的影响，亲密关系也是这样。过往的经历会影响我们在爱情中的依恋状态。那么，什么是依恋呢？“依恋”是我们寻求与某个人的亲密，而且当他在场时就会感觉安全。如果我们爱上某人，会希望与他亲密无间，与他关系的好坏，会决定我们是否感觉安全。而这种依恋模式，会受到个人经历的影响。

科学家们研究发现，当我们还是婴儿的时候，饥饿、尿床或者受到惊吓，妈妈或者抚养者对我们的回应方式，会渐渐让我们产生不同的依恋模式。随着研究的进展，科学家们发现依恋类型普遍分为四种：安全型、痴迷型、恐惧型、回避型。

01 

安全型

安全型：在情感上无论是依赖他人或者被人依赖，都能让自己感觉安心，这类人不害怕独处，也容易被人接纳。当我们儿时被照顾、安抚，就会觉得对方是安全的、可信任的，这样就发展出了安全型依恋。

02 

痴迷型

痴迷型：这种类型相对极端，希望将感情全部投入在情感上，但往往会发现，他人并不一定乐意把亲密关系按照自己期望的那样发展。如果没有亲密关系，就会感觉到不安，担心对方爱自己不够，希望对方像自己一样全心全意付出。这种类型的产生，一般源于在婴儿时期哭喊时，慈爱的抚育者总是如约而至，得到此种呵护的小宝贝们就能舒心地依赖他人，觉得他人可以信任，能从别人那里获得安全和友善。结果，这些儿童就发展成痴迷型依恋。

《婚姻保卫战》曾调停过这样一对恋人：男方十分紧张恋人，对恋人接触的一切异性随时保持敌意，时刻担心恋人被抢走。这样的人，就是典型的痴迷型依恋。他的这种痴迷，让身边的人很不适应，也十分苦恼。

03 

恐惧型

恐惧型：这种人对亲密关系有恐惧不安的感觉，虽然感情上渴望亲密，但却很难完全相信别人，也不敢依赖他人，希望关系更进一步，但是又怕会受到伤害。通常情况下，这些人儿时大人对自己的照顾无法预测，并且并不持续：大人心情好的时候会对自己热情关注，心情烦躁的时候就对自己心不在焉、焦躁不耐烦，有时根本不出现。久而久之，孩子就会对他人产生焦虑、复杂的感情，产生恐惧型依恋。

04 

回避型

回避型：这种人认为，有没有亲密关系都无所谓，甚至有些刻意回避亲密关系。对他们而言，独立与自给自足更重要。他们不喜欢依赖他人，也不喜欢被人依赖。这种类型的产生，主要是因为父母或者抚养者在照顾孩子时，带着拒绝或者敌意，勉强而为之，对婴儿的哭喊漠不关心。孩子就会认为他人是靠不住的，因而在与他人的关系上畏缩不前，表现出回避型依恋。这种类型的人常常怀疑他人，甚至迁怒他人，不容易形成信任和亲密的人际关系。

在一次心理调查中，40%的人认为自己很难信任和依赖伴侣，要么十分担心自己的亲密关系能否持续。这些被调查者也同时报告童年经历和对亲情、爱情的态度，结果表明这些情况和他们的依恋类型是一致的。

当然，这种依恋类型的划分并不十分全面，每个人的程度会有不同，随着后天环境和人际关系的发展，也会有不同的改变。我们并不会被动地受到童年经验的束缚，依恋类型不断地受到我们成人后经历的影响。随着时间的推移，依恋类型的确会发生新的改变。例如：一次悲痛欲绝的分手，会让原本安全型的人不再有安全感；一段如胶似漆的恋情，也能慢慢让回避亲密的人不再怀疑或戒备亲密关系。依恋类型虽然受到儿时经历的影响，但是也会随着接下来的经历慢慢改变，而改变的钥匙就在我们自己的手上。

我们对爱情的看法，是由我们体验到的亲密关系所决定的。你是哪种类型呢？你是否十分信任自己的伴侣，相信伴侣爱着你？或者你在时刻担心对方是否不再喜欢你，将会离开你？其实，如何去爱，如何去经历，都掌握在我们自己手中。愿你能正确爱人，幸福被爱。

# 亲密关系中的识别情绪模式 | 你是哪种“依恋类型”？ • 6秒钟情商官网

摘要： 传统依恋理论认为个体依恋心理和行为模式具有相对稳定性, 但无论在信息加工还是个体发展过程中, 个体依恋模式均表现出二重性, 即既具有相对稳定性, 又具有情境敏感性。个体在情境中所表现出的依恋模式是个体相对稳定的特质性依恋和情境特征相互作用的结果。依恋启动研究中特质性依恋特征与依恋启动效应之间的交互作用模式为理解依恋二重特征及其关系提供了窗口。依恋系统激活的两阶段模型为整合和解释这些相互作用模式提供了框架。未来研究应优化依恋二重特征关系研究中启动效应的操作检验, 考虑依恋焦虑和回避维度的交互作用, 关注高焦虑群体内的依恋差异, 以理析依恋二重特征之间的相互作用方式, 同时关注依恋策略影响依恋启动效应的时间进程, 探究依恋二重特征相互作用的机制。

Abstract: Traditional attachment theory suggests that an individual’s attachment-related psychological and behavioral patterns are relatively stable. However, from information processes or life-span development perspective, attachment patterns have trait-state duality, i.e. attachment patterns are both relatively stable and context-sensitive. An individual’s attachment pattern in a particular context is the consequence of his or her trait attachment and contextual feature interactions. The interaction patterns between trait attachment and attachment priming effects provide a window to understand the duality of attachment and their relationships. And the two-stages model of attachment activation offers a framework for integrating and understanding these patterns. Future studies should optimize the manipulation check of attachment priming, meanwhile, take the interaction between attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety in consideration. More attention should be paid to the individual differences in the high attachment anxiety group which may clarify the patterns of interaction between trait and state attachment. Moreover, the time course of how attachment coping strategies impact the effects of attachment priming should be concerned, which could reveal the mechanism of the interactions between trait and state attachment.

忽远忽近、患得患失，敏感多疑，可能是焦虑型依恋在作祟……

​

 

依恋理论（Attachment theory）最早由英国心理学家John Bowlby所提出，指个体与具有特殊意义的他人形成牢固的情感纽带，提供安全感与安慰，具体可分为安全型、回避型、焦虑型、恐惧型四种。与儿童期的单纯依恋不同（婴儿-照料者），成人间的依恋关系显然更为复杂；不论是日常交友、与父母关系、与子女联结，或是亲密伴侣间的相处，都往往让人心生为难。似乎总有人是天生的社交牛人，可以游刃有余在各类关系间承担责任获得平衡，维持安全型依恋关系。也有一类人，心思细腻、敏感共情、缺少安全感、时而粘人，但同时又害怕被抛弃而故意主动回避，这就是典型的焦虑型依恋人格。

焦虑型依恋人格（anxious-resistant attachment）是指会在关系中极度渴望与对方建立亲密关系，发展稳定，但始终担忧与恐惧对方无法满足自己的期待，建立真正的关系。在这种焦虑下，总会认为自己是付出更多的一方，即使对方给出回应，也还是无法完全确定对方心意，幻想着、害怕着自己随时被抛弃的狼狈。

 

在亲密关系中，焦虑型依恋人格会有如下表现：

​

焦虑型依恋人群内心细腻，非常关注他人的情绪与表现，希望所有人可以舒适与满意，并会经常设身处地想象对方的想法与感受。因此，他们非常需要对方给到的反馈，“自己是否被接纳”、“自己是否让他人满意”、“自己表现是否得体”对他们是非常重要的话题。他们也会思考烦恼许多，纠结是保持自身特点还是迎合他人想法，但终是难以遵从本心，他们认为只有成为大家心中的样子，才不会孤身一人，合群、配合是他们牢记在心的事。

​

因为太害怕被放弃被抛弃，焦虑型依恋的人可能往往陷于自己的幻想，心生沮丧，而后产生嫉妒、气愤等一系列负面情绪，导致出现“粘人”的特质；但同时，他们又是天生的反思自省者，冷静过后，会认为自己是病态的疯狂的。于是会再次产生羞愧等情绪，开始选择回避。同时，他们害怕对方强烈的情感输出，逐步将自己封锁起来。在长期独处后，又会再次变得渴望被靠近，寻求亲密关系。长期往复，内耗不断，导致自己和对方越来越疲惫，形成恶性循环。

​

具有依恋型人格的人群常会在一段关系中，付出自己的所有，避免出现被责怪、被抛弃的结局。他们会在给对方很高评价的同时自我贬低，认为自己不够完美、自信心水平较低，认为自己做的还不够好，而后不断进行自我批评，不断强化这类不合理信念。因此，在这种情况下，他们非常需要关系中的另一方给出确认与肯定，以得到“自己是值得被爱的”、“自己是有长处的”、“自己是不可或缺的”。然而当对方给出的信号不够强烈时，他们可能会敏感、脆弱，甚至多疑失望。

除了上述特征外，此类人群可能还会出现：

- 追求完美

- 自我苛责

- 情绪波动起伏大

- 过度独立、过度依赖

- 关心照顾他人

- 很少表明自己诉求（希望对方猜中自身的心思）

- 害怕被批评

 

那么为什么ta/我是焦虑型依恋人格呢？

​

个体的气质与性格以及基因将会影响个体婴儿时期的表现与行为，如，有些婴儿在离开母亲时表现出高度焦虑、反复啼哭不止、有些表现的过度冷漠、又或者较为平淡。抚养者给予的关注强度与方式不同，就会强化不同的行为模式与内心信念，这些行为模式也会始终伴随个体的成长与发展，形成成年后的依恋模式。

在婴儿时期所形成的行为模式与信念又常与原生家庭中的照料者养育风格或抚养风格有关，焦虑型孩子的父母往往在与孩子相处时情绪波动较大，有时非常热情，给到孩子充足的陪伴、鼓励与爱意，但有时又会因为工作等外部压力影响，态度急转直下，时而冷淡、气愤、指责或是与孩子距离逐渐变远。让孩子们产生矛盾感，想要不断确认自己究竟是否被父母爱着，自己的表现究竟如何，导致在情绪上渴求、索取的越来越多。

是否在童年或成长阶段中经历过被抛弃、是否在某段关系中被伤害等可能会使得个体产生恐惧心理，害怕重蹈覆辙，导致焦虑依恋人格形成。以伴侣亲密关系为例，独自一人时，渴望得到另一人的关注与爱意，但是一旦确立关系后，又渴望对方满心满眼皆是你，同时，在被爱着时又担心自己不够完美，焦虑是否又会被舍弃，一边害怕，一边紧攥。

 

​

​

​

依恋类型虽在儿童时期就会得到确立，但也会根据人的成长经历与个人心理信念更替而不断发展，因此，依恋模式并非是一成不变的，如果你或者身边的ta恰巧也是焦虑型依恋人格，可以从以下方面做出调整：

认识自己的情绪状态，不让瞬间的悲伤、气愤逐步放大并支配自身，当你发现自己或者对方快要失控时，请尝试停下来冷静的帮助自己或对方感知情绪并反思，它从何而来，为何突然袭来，往往情绪过激的背后并不是真正的指责或厌恶，只是单纯渴求安全感与爱意。

调整自己的沟通模式，告诉对方自己的真实想法，坦诚告诉对方你所在意或渴望被满足的需求，减少让对方猜测的机会。说出你在焦虑什么、为何会焦虑、自己做出了哪些努力、希望对方理解哪些部分，告知对方你的期待会让自己和他人更为轻松与安全。如果对方无法满足，也请别责怪自己，也许只是因为ta和你不够适合陪伴彼此。

积累他人对你的爱意、积累他人对你的肯定、积累自己的正向评价、积累自己的开心瞬间，当焦虑袭来时，可以开始回想生活中的美好，给到自己力量与正向暗示，为自己赋能。

也许，帮助自身或者帮助他人偶尔力不从心，请不用担心，你可以寻求心理咨询等专业人员帮助，抽丝剥茧，认识到行为情绪背后所有的触发事件，更好认识自身的潜意识，并提供更为高效专业的方案帮助我们度过纠结、减少痛苦、勇敢促使自身、陪伴他人走出困境，做出改变。

# “我喜欢你，但你离我远点”：恐惧型依恋者的6个迹象-虎嗅网

本文来自微信公众号：简单心理（ID：janelee1231），作者：江湖边，原文标题：《“渴望爱，却充满回避和焦虑”：恐惧型依恋者的6个迹象》，头图来自：《春潮》剧照



你身边是否存在这样一种人：



ta渴望亲密，希望能接近潜在的依恋对象（朋友/伴侣）。



但当那些人靠得太近，ta们会变得非常不舒服，并渴望退出这段关系。然而，觉察到对方离开，ta又变得焦虑，肝肠寸断。



因此，ta传达给别人的信息其实是：“我喜欢你，但你离我远点”。 



be like：







而ta周围的人 ：







1991年，心理学家Bartholomew等人提出，成年人的依恋关系，大致存在4种类型：



安全型（secure）、恐惧型（fearful）、疏离型（dismissing），痴迷型（preoccupied）。







这4种模式的划分基于2个维度：“焦虑（被抛弃）”维度：一个人对自己的看法是积极/消极的；“回避（亲密）”维度：一个人对他人的看法是积极/消极的。



焦虑和回避度都很低，意味着ta们是“安全型依恋者”。ta们对自己和他人都有基本积极的看法，与伴侣亲密相处时感到放松；



剩余3种则都不太安全。



痴迷型依恋者渴望被爱。ta们想要亲密，并很少回避。但由于对自己持消极态度，认为自己不值得好的感情，导致时刻担心被抛弃；



疏离型回避者回避亲密，在交往中习惯保持距离。ta们遇到困难习惯独立解决，认为别人不值得依靠，但积极地看待自己；



恐惧型依恋则最为棘手，ta们的独特之处在于：同时具有“高度焦虑”和“高度回避”特质，对自己和他人都持消极态度。一方面渴望被爱，但由于自我价值低下而认为自己不值得。另一方面又恐惧亲密，在关系中释放“回避”信号。



今天这篇文章，就来聊聊最后一种：恐惧-回避依恋者（也就是开头的例子）。



虽然这一类型在人群中的占比较小（约6%），但ta们往往具有最糟糕的情感体验和人际关系。



一些工作模型表明，恐惧型依恋更可能陷入虐待关系，与较高的边缘人格障碍、解离症状、孤独、抑郁风险相关（Dozier等，1999）。





图/中科院&北同中心



对于这种矛盾处境，David J .Wallin在《心理治疗中的依恋》中打了一个精妙的比喻：



“地下室浓烟滚滚地在着火，而ta拒绝承认从下面传上来的烟味。ta总是处在被淹没的边缘，仿佛在永无休止地等待着另一只鞋掉下来，却不知道那只鞋早已经掉下来过了。”



“不愿意进入亲密关系，但又迫切需要被他人爱”



恐惧型依恋者常具有如下6个特征：



1. 情绪和行为不稳定且不可预测（Sprecher，1998）



当一个人处于“恐惧型”的状态下，ta既担心被抛弃，又对亲密感到不适。



换句话说，ta们没有“对亲密的应对方式”——ta想接近的潜在亲密对象，也是ta害怕接近的人（Khan等，2020年）。在关系中，这种行为常引起误会，让人迷惑不解。







2. 对重要他人的“理想化”和“愤怒”



研究表明，恐惧依恋的成年人会防御性地组织行为，对重要他人出现“理想化（要求一个完美的伴侣）”和“愤怒”的交替情绪，以尽量减少被拒绝的痛苦（Griffin等，1994）。



比如为了不被拒绝，宁愿孤独地过日子。努力减少与他人的情感接触，同时又要延续关系。



3. 拥有极度情绪化的关系



在情绪调节方面，恐惧依恋者往往比其他不安全类型的人更麻烦（Feeney，1999）。



比如，很难从愤怒中平静下来，或容易感到强烈的“被排斥感”……无法应对情绪上的“压倒性来袭”时，可能会做出一些破坏人际关系的行为。



4. ta可能有很多的性伴侣



一项跟踪600人近40年的研究发现，“恐惧依恋”可以预测个人一生中更多的性伴侣数量，以及更大的性依从性（sexual compliance，即遵从伴侣的性欲望）。对男女来说都是如此（Favez等，2019）。



因为ta们渴望爱，却害怕亲密，而偶然的性关系可以让ta们置于这种处境：



性活动既增加了亲密度，逃离可能导致抑郁的想法，也让ta们在感情上保持距离。







《心理学进展》上的一篇文章曾分析了电影《春潮》中祖孙三代形象，认为女儿郭建波是典型的“恐惧依恋风格”。



她对母亲纪明岚有深深的依恋，但在家中长期遭遇谩骂。面对压力，她选择“去激活策略”——郭建波来到情人的住处，短暂的露水情缘让她疲惫的身躯放松下来。在这里，郭建波以转移注意力的方式来逃避对母亲的依恋。



5. ta们更易出现攻击和控制行为



相对其他不安全的依恋类型，恐惧依恋的男性更容易对女性产生敌意、配偶虐待和儿童性虐待（Dutton，1994）。



6. 缺乏自尊，有强烈的拒绝恐惧



从性别维度看，女性比男性更容易产生恐惧依恋（Levy等，1998）。在女性样本中，恐惧依恋者具有“低自尊、沮丧和强烈的注意力需要”。



她们的共同点是，对他人有深深的不信任，不愿意寻求专业帮助。这可能与她们负面的自我看法和强烈的拒绝恐惧有关（Yaben，2010）。



是什么造就了一个恐惧型依恋者？



在Ainsworth等人（1978年）对婴儿所做的著名“陌生情境（Strange Situation）实验”中：



当一名安全型婴儿的母亲离开房间时，孩子会变得非常不安。她一回来，孩子就立刻跑到她身边寻求安慰和关爱。得到宽慰后，孩子会恢复玩耍。



一些婴儿属于回避型。ta们与父母分离时不会哭，不与父母寻求亲近，只是专注地玩玩具；一些婴儿属于矛盾型。ta们对分离非常敏感，即使与父母重聚也无法平静，拒绝接受安慰。







二十年后，Main（1991）等人重新研究这些录像，并分离出了一种“混乱型婴儿（disorganized）”。



这些婴儿的行为则相对奇怪。



比如，ta们可能想呆在父母身边，但避免目光接触；当母亲离开，ta们可能会无休止地尖叫，似乎想吸引大人注意；



ta们有时会表现出相互冲突的行为。比如当母亲回来，“一个孩子张开双臂好像在迎接，但突然又转身僵住、退缩，在房间里漫无目的地游荡”。







后来世界各地的研究者发现，婴儿期的混乱依恋，几乎就是成年人“恐惧依恋”的儿童版，预测准确率在68%~75%之间（Fonagy等，2002）。



对于这些混乱的孩子的研究发现：



1. ta的父母常表现出前后矛盾的行为，这让孩子不能信任ta是“可靠的”



这些婴儿往往经历了不太敏感的照顾（Main&Hesse，1990）。ta寻求与父母的亲近，却遭遇不安全的对待。有时依恋者甚至会表现得咄咄逼人，让孩子觉得“吓人”。



比如，父母因为孩子的某个行为微笑，奖励孩子，但有时会因完全相同的行为惩罚ta，剥夺ta基本的需求。



心理学博士Hal Shorey认为，恐惧依恋的成人，一般在童年时期有过至少一名养育者出现过“可怕的养育行为”。



这会在孩子体内产生一种对自身安全的恐惧——孩子下意识地觉察到，照顾者不能满足自己的需要。







2. 做出“让人恐惧行为”的家长，常常也有情绪问题



混乱型孩子的父母通常都有自己童年时期未解决的创伤。这些父母可能有抑郁、忽视、虐待或酗酒的倾向。与酗酒父母一起长大的小孩，产生恐惧依恋的可能性是不酗酒父母的四倍（Brennan等，1991年）。



然而，父母并不一定具备主观敌意。有精神疾病的家长也同样会让孩子感到害怕——因为孩子知道父母没有能力保护自己。



从神经生物学观点看，一些具有恐惧依恋对象的儿童，甚至可能无法全面发展出整合性的神经结构，导致成年后的情绪失调问题。



换句话说，孩子生来依恋父母，却不能将依恋者视为“安全基地”。在以后的生活中，ta们会创造出一个想要亲密的人，但同时也会创造出一个害怕亲密的人。







如何重建依恋关系中的安全感？



虽然恐惧型依恋听起来很不健康，但这种防御模式被发展起来，一定是因为它曾经保护过自己不受伤害。是面对压力所做出的正常反应。



以及，依恋类型并不一定是一成不变的。如果你经历了重大丧失（例如父母去世），或者受到了其他精神创伤（如冷暴力、长期处于情感虐待关系），安全的依恋风格可能转变为“不安全（包括恐惧型）”。



依恋理论的提出者Bowlby认为，虽然早期的依恋模式影响深远，但在新的关系、安全的关系，或者一个更能自我觉察的个体中，依恋模式都有被“更新”的潜能。



给恐惧型依恋者的几个tips：



克服对安全感的恐惧，寻求一段安全的关系。



比如谈恋爱，大约50%的成年人拥有安全型依恋模式，几率其实还不错。在新的关系中，你可以挑战自己的防御能力，并努力在这种关系中发展自己。



或者去见心理咨询师。心理咨询师会成为关系中的“安全基地”，与来访者重新建立一种新的、可靠的、具有接纳性的依恋关系，整合创伤，促进个人资源的整合。







从情绪上而言，觉察性冥想有可能为恐惧型依恋者提供暴风雨中的避风港（Linehan，1993）。



即：对想法、感受和身体感觉进行观察和做出标识的觉察性练习（而不是回避）。恐惧依恋者常常非常无法应对自己的情绪，这些技巧可能是非常有用的。



为自己的经历写一个连贯的故事。



依恋研究表明，儿童依恋类型的最佳预测因素并不是“父母经历了何种创伤”，而是“父母如何理解、解决这些创伤”。



对于未解决的创伤，一个很关键的做法是为自己创建连贯叙述的过程。重新讲述自己的故事本身，就可以“增强”安全感和个人心理弹性。



最后，如果你身边存在一个恐惧型依恋者：



首先要意识到，自己没办法消除ta所有的痛苦。依恋模式中那些带来痛苦的部分，可能只是过往未解决的创伤所探出的脑袋。



如果你还想保持这段关系，可能还必须忍受一些“测试行为”——ta们可能会做出一些莫名其妙的事，来看你是否会拒绝或伤害自己，不要把这些行为看得过于“个人针对性”。毕竟，我们都是从“自己如何被对待”中学习亲密关系的。这是过去经历的东西所教给ta的道理。

3）放下受害者模式，每个人都应为自己的选择负责

这个话题，算是老生常谈了。在亲密关系里，对对方总是不满意，但还选择关系继续的，那定是这段关系还有继续的价值。

归根结底，放弃还是继续，这是你权衡之后做出的一个选择。每个人都应为自己的选择负责。

如果你总觉得这个选择是被迫的，无奈的，只能两害相权取其轻，但又让自己陷入纠结、矛盾、焦虑或者抑郁之中，那你就要重新审视一下：这个选择对吗？我有能力去做出改变吗？

如果你自己没有答案，那这恰恰是你需要成长的一个点，你如果凭一己之力无法穿越，请及时求助专业的心理咨询师帮助。

你要清楚一点：我自身的问题，需要我自己去面对、去解决。

绝对不是“如果对方怎样怎样，我才能怎样怎样”，这种不合理的信念需要被打破，跳出受害者模式，你才可能做自己幸福的主宰。返回搜狐，查看更多

摘要： 传统依恋理论认为个体依恋心理和行为模式具有相对稳定性, 但无论在信息加工还是个体发展过程中, 个体依恋模式均表现出二重性, 即既具有相对稳定性, 又具有情境敏感性。个体在情境中所表现出的依恋模式是个体相对稳定的特质性依恋和情境特征相互作用的结果。依恋启动研究中特质性依恋特征与依恋启动效应之间的交互作用模式为理解依恋二重特征及其关系提供了窗口。依恋系统激活的两阶段模型为整合和解释这些相互作用模式提供了框架。未来研究应优化依恋二重特征关系研究中启动效应的操作检验, 考虑依恋焦虑和回避维度的交互作用, 关注高焦虑群体内的依恋差异, 以理析依恋二重特征之间的相互作用方式, 同时关注依恋策略影响依恋启动效应的时间进程, 探究依恋二重特征相互作用的机制。

Abstract: Traditional attachment theory suggests that an individual’s attachment-related psychological and behavioral patterns are relatively stable. However, from information processes or life-span development perspective, attachment patterns have trait-state duality, i.e. attachment patterns are both relatively stable and context-sensitive. An individual’s attachment pattern in a particular context is the consequence of his or her trait attachment and contextual feature interactions. The interaction patterns between trait attachment and attachment priming effects provide a window to understand the duality of attachment and their relationships. And the two-stages model of attachment activation offers a framework for integrating and understanding these patterns. Future studies should optimize the manipulation check of attachment priming, meanwhile, take the interaction between attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety in consideration. More attention should be paid to the individual differences in the high attachment anxiety group which may clarify the patterns of interaction between trait and state attachment. Moreover, the time course of how attachment coping strategies impact the effects of attachment priming should be concerned, which could reveal the mechanism of the interactions between trait and state attachment.

# 亲密关系中的识别情绪模式 | 你是哪种“依恋类型”？ • 6秒钟情商官网

 由 Huang, Chamie | 7 月 3, 2020 | 6秒钟, 生活情商 | 0 条评论

每个人都有一些“好模式”和“坏模式”，如果我们不想一次又一次地重复同样的错误，首先要做的就是意识到“问题出在哪里”。本篇文章帮助我们探索自己在亲密关系中的模式，并了解这些模式是如何影响着我们建立和打破关系。

伴侣之间有时会发生争吵，虽然这种场景不常发生，但每一次都很伤人。

妻子回家发现家里有几处衣服，于是抱怨了一句：“你为什么每次都把衣服乱扔！？”，两个人开始为此进行对话，在你一言我一语的过程中，和“反抗”相关的模式被激活，为了证明自己才是对的那一个，对话升级为争吵。

丈夫可能因此被压得喘不过气来，需要独处才能回到安全和爱的状态。妻子可能因此委屈地哭泣，继续不断地诉说，需要一个肯定回应才能安定心神。

依恋类型 Attachment Style

“依恋类型”这个概念最早是由英国精神病学家鲍尔比(John Bowlby，1969)提出的，他将依恋定义为“个体与具有特殊意义的他人形成牢固的情感纽带的倾向，能为个体提供安全和安慰”。

鲍尔比最早提出依恋这个概念主要是用来解释婴儿与其养护者之间的情感联系，但后来的研究者们将之扩展到了成人之间。

现在依恋(Attachment)主要指：个体与主要抚养者发展出的一种特殊的、积极的情感纽带，也是指个体寻求并企图与另一个体在身体和情感上保持亲密联系的倾向。

阅读以下描述，看看你属于三种类型中的哪种依恋类型？

◈ 焦虑（对抗）型 Anxious-resistant

你需要从伴侣那里得到许多关注才能感觉到被爱。你经常会有一种“距离感”，你可能讨厌带着愤怒说晚安，你需要先解决争吵，才能再次感到“完整”。可能表现的比较“黏人”或“需要帮助”。

◈ 安全型 Secure

你乐于给予和接受关注，与对方距离太远或太近时，你都意识到，然后会要求更多的空间或更多的关注来让自己感到舒服。你认定的事情不会因他人的行为而受到影响。

◈ 回避型 Avoidant

你非常重视独立和个人空间，可能不太愿意给予或接受感情。当一段感情开始后，你很快就会意识到这需要你放弃独立，所以可能难长时间维持一段感情。你可能会听到他人评价你有些自私或冷漠。

在这些描述中，你认出自己和伴侣了吗？每个依恋类型都会有相似的一些“模式”，而在亲密关系中，每个人也可以通过脱离自动驾驶模式，有意识地选择或改变自己的模式，来更好的支持彼此。

接下来，一起看一些故事和例子吧。

 

焦虑对抗型 vs 回避型 

在争论期间，回避型Andy想要独处的空间，而焦虑对抗型Judy却想要在一起。花了一段时间，他们终于认识到双方的不同模式。当Andy发现自己不知所措时，他想找到最近的出口，独处一段时间。而Judy感到难过时，希望自己可以更多的被关注和照顾。Andy和Judy共同讨论两人的模式，并运用同理心去理解对方的观点，他们商量出一个共同的策略。

当他们吵架时，Andy会有一段自己的时间，可以是30分钟，3个小时，一天……但需要事先告知Judy。时间到了后，Andy会充满能量的回来。而Judy知道了Andy的独处时间是多久，她会因此感到安全。在这段时间里，她能够专注于自己，比如与家人聊天、和朋友逛街等。Judy也会轻轻地提醒Andy，他们有一个共同的约定。在这种情况下，他们两个互相满足了对方的需求。

回避型 vs 回避型 

Lucy和Peter都是回避型的依恋类型，很多时候他们都宁愿一个人呆着。尽管他们都非常重视稳定以及家人关系，但他们很容易忘记保持良好的关系需要一些情感上的工作。于是他们发现双方的模式后，共同讨论了一个策略。

他们每周安排一次时间，以情侣的身份进行连接。他们共同撰写了一份文件，表达对方自己有多重要，在争论之后回看这份文件。除此之外，他们优先考虑各自的独处时间，有时也会利用这个时间来表达对彼此的爱。Lucy会为Peter写爱情日记，而Peter则会用心为Lucy挑选礼物。为了避免自己忽略对方的需求和感受，他们还找到了可信赖的咨询师来支持他们。他们虽然都是回避型，但也可以通过一起学习，相互支持，来体会爱这样一件美好、安全的事情。

焦虑对抗型 vs 焦虑对抗型 

John和Jane都是焦虑对抗型，平时他们甜蜜得似胶如漆，彼此间充满爱意。于是在争执时，他们都会希望得到对方的关注。但驾驭情绪对于同样是焦虑型的Jane和John，都很挑战，因此，为了更好地谈论和验证情绪，他们也共同制定了一个策略。

一旦有谁感到受伤，先准确地表达自己的感受，而不是使用置气、抱怨的方式进行交流，此时另一方需要表达爱、安全和谅解。这样不仅能共同满足彼此的需求，他们也体会到爱不一定是要每时每刻在一起，独处时也可以从自己的内心感受到爱与支持，并再稳定地给予对方。

不论是什么依恋类型，也不论是什么样的模式，建立长期幸福关系的技巧很简单：确保满足每个人的需求。识别情绪模式也不是为了改变，而是更有意识地选择更合适的回应。

那么，你在亲密关系中是属于哪种依恋类型？你的伴侣呢？针对你们相处的模式，可以共同制定什么样策略来让彼此的感情更为长久和稳定？

忽远忽近、患得患失，敏感多疑，可能是焦虑型依恋在作祟……

​

 

依恋理论（Attachment theory）最早由英国心理学家John Bowlby所提出，指个体与具有特殊意义的他人形成牢固的情感纽带，提供安全感与安慰，具体可分为安全型、回避型、焦虑型、恐惧型四种。与儿童期的单纯依恋不同（婴儿-照料者），成人间的依恋关系显然更为复杂；不论是日常交友、与父母关系、与子女联结，或是亲密伴侣间的相处，都往往让人心生为难。似乎总有人是天生的社交牛人，可以游刃有余在各类关系间承担责任获得平衡，维持安全型依恋关系。也有一类人，心思细腻、敏感共情、缺少安全感、时而粘人，但同时又害怕被抛弃而故意主动回避，这就是典型的焦虑型依恋人格。

焦虑型依恋人格（anxious-resistant attachment）是指会在关系中极度渴望与对方建立亲密关系，发展稳定，但始终担忧与恐惧对方无法满足自己的期待，建立真正的关系。在这种焦虑下，总会认为自己是付出更多的一方，即使对方给出回应，也还是无法完全确定对方心意，幻想着、害怕着自己随时被抛弃的狼狈。

 

在亲密关系中，焦虑型依恋人格会有如下表现：

​

焦虑型依恋人群内心细腻，非常关注他人的情绪与表现，希望所有人可以舒适与满意，并会经常设身处地想象对方的想法与感受。因此，他们非常需要对方给到的反馈，“自己是否被接纳”、“自己是否让他人满意”、“自己表现是否得体”对他们是非常重要的话题。他们也会思考烦恼许多，纠结是保持自身特点还是迎合他人想法，但终是难以遵从本心，他们认为只有成为大家心中的样子，才不会孤身一人，合群、配合是他们牢记在心的事。

​

因为太害怕被放弃被抛弃，焦虑型依恋的人可能往往陷于自己的幻想，心生沮丧，而后产生嫉妒、气愤等一系列负面情绪，导致出现“粘人”的特质；但同时，他们又是天生的反思自省者，冷静过后，会认为自己是病态的疯狂的。于是会再次产生羞愧等情绪，开始选择回避。同时，他们害怕对方强烈的情感输出，逐步将自己封锁起来。在长期独处后，又会再次变得渴望被靠近，寻求亲密关系。长期往复，内耗不断，导致自己和对方越来越疲惫，形成恶性循环。

​

具有依恋型人格的人群常会在一段关系中，付出自己的所有，避免出现被责怪、被抛弃的结局。他们会在给对方很高评价的同时自我贬低，认为自己不够完美、自信心水平较低，认为自己做的还不够好，而后不断进行自我批评，不断强化这类不合理信念。因此，在这种情况下，他们非常需要关系中的另一方给出确认与肯定，以得到“自己是值得被爱的”、“自己是有长处的”、“自己是不可或缺的”。然而当对方给出的信号不够强烈时，他们可能会敏感、脆弱，甚至多疑失望。

除了上述特征外，此类人群可能还会出现：

- 追求完美

- 自我苛责

- 情绪波动起伏大

- 过度独立、过度依赖

- 关心照顾他人

- 很少表明自己诉求（希望对方猜中自身的心思）

- 害怕被批评

 

那么为什么ta/我是焦虑型依恋人格呢？

​

个体的气质与性格以及基因将会影响个体婴儿时期的表现与行为，如，有些婴儿在离开母亲时表现出高度焦虑、反复啼哭不止、有些表现的过度冷漠、又或者较为平淡。抚养者给予的关注强度与方式不同，就会强化不同的行为模式与内心信念，这些行为模式也会始终伴随个体的成长与发展，形成成年后的依恋模式。

在婴儿时期所形成的行为模式与信念又常与原生家庭中的照料者养育风格或抚养风格有关，焦虑型孩子的父母往往在与孩子相处时情绪波动较大，有时非常热情，给到孩子充足的陪伴、鼓励与爱意，但有时又会因为工作等外部压力影响，态度急转直下，时而冷淡、气愤、指责或是与孩子距离逐渐变远。让孩子们产生矛盾感，想要不断确认自己究竟是否被父母爱着，自己的表现究竟如何，导致在情绪上渴求、索取的越来越多。

是否在童年或成长阶段中经历过被抛弃、是否在某段关系中被伤害等可能会使得个体产生恐惧心理，害怕重蹈覆辙，导致焦虑依恋人格形成。以伴侣亲密关系为例，独自一人时，渴望得到另一人的关注与爱意，但是一旦确立关系后，又渴望对方满心满眼皆是你，同时，在被爱着时又担心自己不够完美，焦虑是否又会被舍弃，一边害怕，一边紧攥。

 

​

​

​

依恋类型虽在儿童时期就会得到确立，但也会根据人的成长经历与个人心理信念更替而不断发展，因此，依恋模式并非是一成不变的，如果你或者身边的ta恰巧也是焦虑型依恋人格，可以从以下方面做出调整：

认识自己的情绪状态，不让瞬间的悲伤、气愤逐步放大并支配自身，当你发现自己或者对方快要失控时，请尝试停下来冷静的帮助自己或对方感知情绪并反思，它从何而来，为何突然袭来，往往情绪过激的背后并不是真正的指责或厌恶，只是单纯渴求安全感与爱意。

调整自己的沟通模式，告诉对方自己的真实想法，坦诚告诉对方你所在意或渴望被满足的需求，减少让对方猜测的机会。说出你在焦虑什么、为何会焦虑、自己做出了哪些努力、希望对方理解哪些部分，告知对方你的期待会让自己和他人更为轻松与安全。如果对方无法满足，也请别责怪自己，也许只是因为ta和你不够适合陪伴彼此。

积累他人对你的爱意、积累他人对你的肯定、积累自己的正向评价、积累自己的开心瞬间，当焦虑袭来时，可以开始回想生活中的美好，给到自己力量与正向暗示，为自己赋能。

也许，帮助自身或者帮助他人偶尔力不从心，请不用担心，你可以寻求心理咨询等专业人员帮助，抽丝剥茧，认识到行为情绪背后所有的触发事件，更好认识自身的潜意识，并提供更为高效专业的方案帮助我们度过纠结、减少痛苦、勇敢促使自身、陪伴他人走出困境，做出改变。

# “我喜欢你，但你离我远点”：恐惧型依恋者的6个迹象-虎嗅网

本文来自微信公众号：简单心理（ID：janelee1231），作者：江湖边，原文标题：《“渴望爱，却充满回避和焦虑”：恐惧型依恋者的6个迹象》，头图来自：《春潮》剧照



你身边是否存在这样一种人：



ta渴望亲密，希望能接近潜在的依恋对象（朋友/伴侣）。



但当那些人靠得太近，ta们会变得非常不舒服，并渴望退出这段关系。然而，觉察到对方离开，ta又变得焦虑，肝肠寸断。



因此，ta传达给别人的信息其实是：“我喜欢你，但你离我远点”。 



be like：







而ta周围的人 ：







1991年，心理学家Bartholomew等人提出，成年人的依恋关系，大致存在4种类型：



安全型（secure）、恐惧型（fearful）、疏离型（dismissing），痴迷型（preoccupied）。







这4种模式的划分基于2个维度：“焦虑（被抛弃）”维度：一个人对自己的看法是积极/消极的；“回避（亲密）”维度：一个人对他人的看法是积极/消极的。



焦虑和回避度都很低，意味着ta们是“安全型依恋者”。ta们对自己和他人都有基本积极的看法，与伴侣亲密相处时感到放松；



剩余3种则都不太安全。



痴迷型依恋者渴望被爱。ta们想要亲密，并很少回避。但由于对自己持消极态度，认为自己不值得好的感情，导致时刻担心被抛弃；



疏离型回避者回避亲密，在交往中习惯保持距离。ta们遇到困难习惯独立解决，认为别人不值得依靠，但积极地看待自己；



恐惧型依恋则最为棘手，ta们的独特之处在于：同时具有“高度焦虑”和“高度回避”特质，对自己和他人都持消极态度。一方面渴望被爱，但由于自我价值低下而认为自己不值得。另一方面又恐惧亲密，在关系中释放“回避”信号。



今天这篇文章，就来聊聊最后一种：恐惧-回避依恋者（也就是开头的例子）。



虽然这一类型在人群中的占比较小（约6%），但ta们往往具有最糟糕的情感体验和人际关系。



一些工作模型表明，恐惧型依恋更可能陷入虐待关系，与较高的边缘人格障碍、解离症状、孤独、抑郁风险相关（Dozier等，1999）。





图/中科院&北同中心



对于这种矛盾处境，David J .Wallin在《心理治疗中的依恋》中打了一个精妙的比喻：



“地下室浓烟滚滚地在着火，而ta拒绝承认从下面传上来的烟味。ta总是处在被淹没的边缘，仿佛在永无休止地等待着另一只鞋掉下来，却不知道那只鞋早已经掉下来过了。”



“不愿意进入亲密关系，但又迫切需要被他人爱”



恐惧型依恋者常具有如下6个特征：



1. 情绪和行为不稳定且不可预测（Sprecher，1998）



当一个人处于“恐惧型”的状态下，ta既担心被抛弃，又对亲密感到不适。



换句话说，ta们没有“对亲密的应对方式”——ta想接近的潜在亲密对象，也是ta害怕接近的人（Khan等，2020年）。在关系中，这种行为常引起误会，让人迷惑不解。







2. 对重要他人的“理想化”和“愤怒”



研究表明，恐惧依恋的成年人会防御性地组织行为，对重要他人出现“理想化（要求一个完美的伴侣）”和“愤怒”的交替情绪，以尽量减少被拒绝的痛苦（Griffin等，1994）。



比如为了不被拒绝，宁愿孤独地过日子。努力减少与他人的情感接触，同时又要延续关系。



3. 拥有极度情绪化的关系



在情绪调节方面，恐惧依恋者往往比其他不安全类型的人更麻烦（Feeney，1999）。



比如，很难从愤怒中平静下来，或容易感到强烈的“被排斥感”……无法应对情绪上的“压倒性来袭”时，可能会做出一些破坏人际关系的行为。



4. ta可能有很多的性伴侣



一项跟踪600人近40年的研究发现，“恐惧依恋”可以预测个人一生中更多的性伴侣数量，以及更大的性依从性（sexual compliance，即遵从伴侣的性欲望）。对男女来说都是如此（Favez等，2019）。



因为ta们渴望爱，却害怕亲密，而偶然的性关系可以让ta们置于这种处境：



性活动既增加了亲密度，逃离可能导致抑郁的想法，也让ta们在感情上保持距离。







《心理学进展》上的一篇文章曾分析了电影《春潮》中祖孙三代形象，认为女儿郭建波是典型的“恐惧依恋风格”。



她对母亲纪明岚有深深的依恋，但在家中长期遭遇谩骂。面对压力，她选择“去激活策略”——郭建波来到情人的住处，短暂的露水情缘让她疲惫的身躯放松下来。在这里，郭建波以转移注意力的方式来逃避对母亲的依恋。



5. ta们更易出现攻击和控制行为



相对其他不安全的依恋类型，恐惧依恋的男性更容易对女性产生敌意、配偶虐待和儿童性虐待（Dutton，1994）。



6. 缺乏自尊，有强烈的拒绝恐惧



从性别维度看，女性比男性更容易产生恐惧依恋（Levy等，1998）。在女性样本中，恐惧依恋者具有“低自尊、沮丧和强烈的注意力需要”。



她们的共同点是，对他人有深深的不信任，不愿意寻求专业帮助。这可能与她们负面的自我看法和强烈的拒绝恐惧有关（Yaben，2010）。



是什么造就了一个恐惧型依恋者？



在Ainsworth等人（1978年）对婴儿所做的著名“陌生情境（Strange Situation）实验”中：



当一名安全型婴儿的母亲离开房间时，孩子会变得非常不安。她一回来，孩子就立刻跑到她身边寻求安慰和关爱。得到宽慰后，孩子会恢复玩耍。



一些婴儿属于回避型。ta们与父母分离时不会哭，不与父母寻求亲近，只是专注地玩玩具；一些婴儿属于矛盾型。ta们对分离非常敏感，即使与父母重聚也无法平静，拒绝接受安慰。







二十年后，Main（1991）等人重新研究这些录像，并分离出了一种“混乱型婴儿（disorganized）”。



这些婴儿的行为则相对奇怪。



比如，ta们可能想呆在父母身边，但避免目光接触；当母亲离开，ta们可能会无休止地尖叫，似乎想吸引大人注意；



ta们有时会表现出相互冲突的行为。比如当母亲回来，“一个孩子张开双臂好像在迎接，但突然又转身僵住、退缩，在房间里漫无目的地游荡”。







后来世界各地的研究者发现，婴儿期的混乱依恋，几乎就是成年人“恐惧依恋”的儿童版，预测准确率在68%~75%之间（Fonagy等，2002）。



对于这些混乱的孩子的研究发现：



1. ta的父母常表现出前后矛盾的行为，这让孩子不能信任ta是“可靠的”



这些婴儿往往经历了不太敏感的照顾（Main&Hesse，1990）。ta寻求与父母的亲近，却遭遇不安全的对待。有时依恋者甚至会表现得咄咄逼人，让孩子觉得“吓人”。



比如，父母因为孩子的某个行为微笑，奖励孩子，但有时会因完全相同的行为惩罚ta，剥夺ta基本的需求。



心理学博士Hal Shorey认为，恐惧依恋的成人，一般在童年时期有过至少一名养育者出现过“可怕的养育行为”。



这会在孩子体内产生一种对自身安全的恐惧——孩子下意识地觉察到，照顾者不能满足自己的需要。







2. 做出“让人恐惧行为”的家长，常常也有情绪问题



混乱型孩子的父母通常都有自己童年时期未解决的创伤。这些父母可能有抑郁、忽视、虐待或酗酒的倾向。与酗酒父母一起长大的小孩，产生恐惧依恋的可能性是不酗酒父母的四倍（Brennan等，1991年）。



然而，父母并不一定具备主观敌意。有精神疾病的家长也同样会让孩子感到害怕——因为孩子知道父母没有能力保护自己。



从神经生物学观点看，一些具有恐惧依恋对象的儿童，甚至可能无法全面发展出整合性的神经结构，导致成年后的情绪失调问题。



换句话说，孩子生来依恋父母，却不能将依恋者视为“安全基地”。在以后的生活中，ta们会创造出一个想要亲密的人，但同时也会创造出一个害怕亲密的人。







如何重建依恋关系中的安全感？



虽然恐惧型依恋听起来很不健康，但这种防御模式被发展起来，一定是因为它曾经保护过自己不受伤害。是面对压力所做出的正常反应。



以及，依恋类型并不一定是一成不变的。如果你经历了重大丧失（例如父母去世），或者受到了其他精神创伤（如冷暴力、长期处于情感虐待关系），安全的依恋风格可能转变为“不安全（包括恐惧型）”。



依恋理论的提出者Bowlby认为，虽然早期的依恋模式影响深远，但在新的关系、安全的关系，或者一个更能自我觉察的个体中，依恋模式都有被“更新”的潜能。



给恐惧型依恋者的几个tips：



克服对安全感的恐惧，寻求一段安全的关系。



比如谈恋爱，大约50%的成年人拥有安全型依恋模式，几率其实还不错。在新的关系中，你可以挑战自己的防御能力，并努力在这种关系中发展自己。



或者去见心理咨询师。心理咨询师会成为关系中的“安全基地”，与来访者重新建立一种新的、可靠的、具有接纳性的依恋关系，整合创伤，促进个人资源的整合。







从情绪上而言，觉察性冥想有可能为恐惧型依恋者提供暴风雨中的避风港（Linehan，1993）。



即：对想法、感受和身体感觉进行观察和做出标识的觉察性练习（而不是回避）。恐惧依恋者常常非常无法应对自己的情绪，这些技巧可能是非常有用的。



为自己的经历写一个连贯的故事。



依恋研究表明，儿童依恋类型的最佳预测因素并不是“父母经历了何种创伤”，而是“父母如何理解、解决这些创伤”。



对于未解决的创伤，一个很关键的做法是为自己创建连贯叙述的过程。重新讲述自己的故事本身，就可以“增强”安全感和个人心理弹性。



最后，如果你身边存在一个恐惧型依恋者：



首先要意识到，自己没办法消除ta所有的痛苦。依恋模式中那些带来痛苦的部分，可能只是过往未解决的创伤所探出的脑袋。



如果你还想保持这段关系，可能还必须忍受一些“测试行为”——ta们可能会做出一些莫名其妙的事，来看你是否会拒绝或伤害自己，不要把这些行为看得过于“个人针对性”。毕竟，我们都是从“自己如何被对待”中学习亲密关系的。这是过去经历的东西所教给ta的道理。

传统依恋理论认为个体依恋心理和行为模式具有相对稳定性, 但无论在信息加工还是个体发展过程中, 个体依恋模式均表现出二重性, 即既具有相对稳定性, 又具有情境敏感性。个体在情境中所表现出的依恋模式是个体相对稳定的特质性依恋和情境特征相互作用的结果。依恋启动研究中特质性依恋特征与依恋启动效应之间的交互作用模式为理解依恋二重特征及其关系提供了窗口。依恋系统激活的两阶段模型为整合和解释这些相互作用模式提供了框架。未来研究应优化依恋二重特征关系研究中启动效应的操作检验, 考虑依恋焦虑和回避维度的交互作用, 关注高焦虑群体内的依恋差异, 以理析依恋二重特征之间的相互作用方式, 同时关注依恋策略影响依恋启动效应的时间进程, 探究依恋二重特征相互作用的机制。

Traditional attachment theory suggests that an individual’s attachment-related psychological and behavioral patterns are relatively stable. However, from information processes or life-span development perspective, attachment patterns have trait-state duality, i.e. attachment patterns are both relatively stable and context-sensitive. An individual’s attachment pattern in a particular context is the consequence of his or her trait attachment and contextual feature interactions. The interaction patterns between trait attachment and attachment priming effects provide a window to understand the duality of attachment and their relationships. And the two-stages model of attachment activation offers a framework for integrating and understanding these patterns. Future studies should optimize the manipulation check of attachment priming, meanwhile, take the interaction between attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety in consideration. More attention should be paid to the individual differences in the high attachment anxiety group which may clarify the patterns of interaction between trait and state attachment. Moreover, the time course of how attachment coping strategies impact the effects of attachment priming should be concerned, which could reveal the mechanism of the interactions between trait and state attachment.

基于生命早期经验形成的依恋心理和行为模式具有相对稳定性, 会对个体生命全程的人际关系、人格发展等产生深远影响是依恋理论的核心假设之一(Raby & Dozier, 2019)。但实证研究对这一观点提出了挑战, 纵向研究表明早期依恋模式与之后不同时期依恋模式的相关性较低(Fraley & Roisman, 2019)。同时, 社会认知研究发现个体依恋相关心理和行为会受当前情境影响, 暂时表现出不同于个体长期占主导地位的依恋模式的特征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016a, 2016b)。可见, 个体依恋心理和行为模式既有相对稳定性, 也有情境敏感性。换句话说, 情境中个体的依恋心理和行为特征处于稳定性和情境引致变化性的张力中, 如同路边的树, 没有风的时候指向其经年累月形成的固定方向, 风吹来, 树的朝向则会随风而变, 风一停止, 则又恢复到原来的朝向。

社会认知范式为研究情境对依恋的影响以及个体依恋特征与情境的交互作用提供了有效工具和新证据, 但个体依恋特征具有二重性的观点也见于传统依恋研究文献中。研究者遵循Bowlby (1969/1982)以及Ainsworth, Bell和Stayton (1972)强调依恋个体差异的传统, 将个体依恋特征视为一种具有跨时空、跨情境稳定性的特质。受此研究思路的影响, 依恋类型的划分、稳定性及早期依恋经验对个体之后各领域发展的影响等问题一直是依恋研究的焦点。但Bowlby (1969/1982, 1973)在论述依恋特征具有相对稳定性的同时, 也强调个体依恋系统具有情境敏感性, 即个体依恋系统受情境因素的影响而被激活或终止激活。但由于研究方法的限制, 直至最近20年, 依恋稳定性与情境敏感性问题才得到系统研究。研究者借鉴社会认知领域的相关理论和研究范式, 开始关注依恋个体差异背后的认知加工过程, 证实了个体依恋相关心理和行为特征会因情境作用表现出不同于个体长期依恋模式的状态性特征(Fraley, 2007; Gillath, Hart, Noftle, & Stockdale, 2009)。同时, 个体较稳定的依恋特征与依恋相关情境特征共同决定了个体在某一依恋情境中最终的心理和行为表现(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016a)。

个体心理和行为模式的稳定性和变化性问题始终是人格、自我领域关注的重要问题(Conway, Singer, & Tagini, 2004)。理解个体依恋特征既具有相对稳定性又具有情境敏感性, 以及个体稳定性依恋特征如何与情境交互作用共同影响个体在某一具体情境中的依恋表现, 有助于加深人们对个体如何应对情境中依恋刺激的理解, 以及对依恋行为在进化中适应意义的认识。本文首先将讨论个体依恋二重特征的定义及其在信息加工和个体发展中的表现, 继而梳理依恋启动研究中特质性依恋与依恋启动效应的交互作用模式, 最后以依恋系统激活两阶段模型对这些交互作用模式进行整合和解释, 以期助益于将来相关研究的开展。

依恋特征是由与依恋相关的知识、情绪、认知加工和行为等构成的集群(constellation)或模式(Fraley & Roisman, 2019)。学者分别使用“特质性依恋(trait attachment)”和“状态性依恋(state attachment)” 描述个体在依恋相关情境中表现出来的相对稳定的心理和行为特征和因情境刺激变化而暂时表现出的不同于个体稳定特征的暂时性特征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2017)。潜在状态-特质理论认为, 个体的心理和行为取决于个体特征, 情境特征和个体与情境的交互作用。同时, 个体在具体情境中的心理和行为特征会随情境变化而变化, 从这个意义上讲, 个体在某一情境中表现出的心理和行为特征均是状态性的(Steyer, Schmitt, & Eid, 1999)。按该理论, 个体在具体情境中表现出的依恋特征均是状态性依恋, 且状态性依恋特征是由个体特质性依恋特征、情境特征以及两者的交互作用决定的。以下将在“个体-情境”框架下, 从信息加工的视角对特质性依恋和状态性依恋进行界定和说明。

特质性依恋是个体依恋特征中具有相对稳定性和跨时空一致性的特征, 它反映了个体较长时间内依恋特征的平均水平。个体会在长期依恋互动经验中形成相对稳定的依恋表征和图式, 其中占主导地位的依恋图式会影响个体在某一情境中的依恋心理和行为。特质性依恋有助于个体避免陷于无序和混乱中, 对保持自我同一性和连续性十分重要, 同时该类特征有助于人们对依恋相关心理和行为进行解释和预测。在传统依恋研究中, 研究者多使用依恋类型对个体依恋行为特征进行描述和组织, 如陌生情景测验、Q分类法、故事完成测验、成人依恋访谈、当前关系访谈 (Ainsworth et al., 1972; Ainsworth, Bell, & Stayton, 1971; Bretherton, Ridgeway, & Cassidy, 1990; Crowell & Owens, 1996; Hazan & Shaver, 1987; Waters & Deane, 1985), 研究发现使用依恋维度描述个体依恋特征可能比采用依恋类型更具优势(Fraley, Hundson, Heffernan, & Segal, 2015), 常用测量依恋维度的工具包括亲密关系经历问卷和父母与同伴依恋问卷等(Armsden & Greenberg, 1987; Brennan, Clark, & Shaver, 1998)。但无论类型法还是维度法, 均假设个体存在稳定的依恋模式, 依恋模式作为一种特质具有跨时间和跨情境一致性, 且存在个体差异。个体依恋类型或依恋维度旨在捕捉个体在较长时间内、在不同情境下均会表现出的依恋特征。

状态性依恋是个体特质性依恋与其所处具体情境共同作用所表现出来的心理和行为特征。个体所处情境既包括外源性特征, 如情境中危险线索, 依恋对象的声音或照片等, 也包括内源性特征, 如个体回忆和心境等。因情境特征的复杂、多变, 状态性依恋常表现出不同于特质性依恋的特征。状态性依恋意味着个体嵌套于当前情境中, 个体的依恋反应是灵活且可修正的, 该类特征有助于个体适应当前环境。尽管Bowlby (1969/1982)提出依恋系统具有情境敏感性, 个体依恋特征并非静态、不变的, 但后来研究者仅将情境特征变化作为捕获个体特质性依恋的工具和方法, 如在陌生情境测验中, 研究者通过操纵情境(母婴分离和团聚)引发婴幼儿的依恋行为, 以对母婴依恋关系进行分类(Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978)。随着依恋研究中认知转向的出现, 研究者开始借鉴认知心理学的实验范式, 特别是启动范式, 对情境线索如何影响依恋相关心理和行为进行研究(Bryant & Bali, 2018; Gillath & Karantzas, 2018; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2017)。在依恋启动研究中, 研究者通过操纵刺激材料改变个体所处情境的特征, 探究个体特质性依恋与情境的交互作用。在依恋启动范式中, 启动效应是状态性依恋的表现或其发挥作用的结果, 研究者通过依恋启动效应可以深入了解状态性依恋。

传统社会和人格研究中, 常以“时间”作为特质性和状态性心理和行为划分的标准, 如Gillath等(2009)开发的成人状态依恋问卷(State Adult Attachment Measure, SAAM)即将依恋行为特征的持续时间作为区分特质性依恋和状态性依恋的标准。而本文对特质性依恋和状态性依恋的界定是从信息加工过程的角度进行的。特质性依恋反映了个体长期依恋特征的平均水平, 而状态性依恋因为情境的复杂、变化性, 常表现为对特质性依恋的暂时偏离。

依恋特征的二重性与信息加工中自上而下和自下而上两类加工过程密切相关。从信息加工的视角看, 个体在依恋相关任务中的表现, 既包含自上而下依恋表征驱动的加工过程, 也包括自下而上情境线索驱动的加工过程(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016b), 两者共同决定了个体最终表现出的心理和行为特征。个体生而具有的依恋系统会对当前依恋相关物理和心理线索和依恋对象可用性(availability)进行评估, 并结合内部工作模式设定个体当前依恋目标 (Bretherton, 1985)。依恋目标驱使个体在需要时向重要他人寻求亲密, 以减轻痛苦并保护自己免受威胁(Bowlby, 1969/1982, 1973)。个体最终表现出的依恋特征是由个体内部工作模式和当前情境特征共同决定的(Fraley, 2007; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016a)。个体内部工作模式具有相对稳定性, 但其所处的情境(如是否存在危险, 依恋对象是否在身边等)则是时刻变化的, 这决定了个体依恋在不同情境下既会表现出某些共同特征, 也会表现出情境特异性特征。

应注意, 尽管状态性依恋和纵向研究中的依恋可变性都强调“变化”, 但两者不可混为一谈。前者所强调的变化是指在某一具体情境中依恋特征的暂时性改变; 而后者则是指特质性依恋在较长时期内是可以变化的。从个体发展历程的角度看, 在一段时间内个体依恋模式具有相对稳定性, 而个体发展, 生活环境变化、新的依恋关系形成等均会在一定程度上改变个体原有的依恋模式(Feeney, 2016; Fraley, 2007)。这与Piaget (1954)提出的同化和顺应观点一致, 个体在与环境的交互中, 通过同化过程, 个体依恋模式得以保持相对稳定, 而通过顺应过程, 个体依恋模式又会发生变化, 同化和顺应过程交互作用塑造了个体的依恋模式。尽管传统依恋理论认为在发展过程中个体依恋模式具有相对稳定性(Fraley & Roisman, 2019), 但纵向研究发现儿童养育环境与其成年后的依恋模式平均相关效应值约为0.15 (Fraley, Roisman, Booth-LaForce, Owen, & Holland, 2013; Chopik, Moors, & Edelstein, 2014)。再者, 发展时期也是影响依恋稳定性的因素之一, 依恋模式发展的社会化-选择不对称模型(socialization- selection asymmetries)认为儿童依恋模式会表现出更高的变化性, 而成人则表现出更高的稳定性。

总之, 在个体发展过程中特质性依恋是可变的, 而在较短时间内个体依恋既会表现出相对稳定的特征也会表现出情境特异性特征。个体依恋模式的二重性体现了依恋在人类进化过程中的适应意义, 即为适应不断变化的环境, 个体依恋相关心理和行为需取得稳定性和情境敏感性的动态平衡。

尽管Bowlby (1969/1982)在依恋理论建构时就提出, 个体依恋行为具有情境敏感性, 但受研究方法的限制, 传统研究工具大多旨在测量个体的特质性依恋, 如陌生情境测验、Q分类法和故事完成测验等(Ainsworth et al., 1978; Bretherton et al., 1990; Waters & Deane, 1985), 并不能对状态性依恋及两者之间的关系进行研究。随着启动范式在依恋领域的应用, 研究者可以在同一任务中同时考察特质性依恋和状态性依恋的关系 (Birnbaum, Hirschberger, & Goldenberg, 2011; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Hudson & Fraley, 2018; Mikulincer, Hirschberger, Nachmias, & Gillath, 2001; Stupica, Brett, Woodhouse, & Cassidy, 2018)。研究者通常用依恋维度(依恋焦虑和依恋回避)和依恋类型反映特质性依恋, 用依恋启动效应反映状态性依恋或状态性依恋的结果。依恋启动效应按启动刺激效价可分为安全启动效应和不安全启动效应(Gabriel, Kawakami, Bartak, Kang, & Mann, 2010; Granqvist, Mikulincer, Gewirtz, & Shaver, 2012)。需要注意的是在启动条件下, 状态性依恋与依恋启动效应并不相同。在依恋启动范式中, (外源性和内源性)启动刺激会引起个体依恋特征的状态性改变, 而依恋特征的状态性改变可能影响与依恋并非直接相关的认知加工和行为, 如创造性问题解决、团体认同和抑郁症状等(Carnelley, Bejinaru, Otway, Baldwin, & Rowe, 2018; Mikulincer, Shaver, & Rom, 2011; Rosenthal et al., 2012)。启动刺激作用下, 个体表现出的不同于特质性依恋的、与依恋直接相关的信息加工过程和行为特征才属于状态性依恋。这种改变及由其引起的其他与依恋并非直接相关认知和行为的变化均属于依恋启动效应。这些与依恋并非直接相关的认知和行为的改变在一定程度上也可以反映个体状态性依恋, 因此个体依恋维度得分或依恋类型与依恋启动效应的交互作用为认识个体特质性依恋和状态性依恋的关系提供了窗口。

安全依恋启动通过向被试呈现与依恋相关的刺激(如依恋对象的名字或照片), 激活依恋安全基地(secure base)相关心理表征进而影响个体后续心理和行为反应。安全依恋启动效应与依恋焦虑存在不同的交互作用模式。有研究表明低焦虑个体更容易受安全依恋启动影响, 而高焦虑个体则不易受此影响。安全启动后低焦虑个体对共情记忆的通达性更高(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001), 情绪感受更积极(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018), 而在这些研究中均未发现安全启动对高焦虑个体的显著影响。但也有研究发现了与之相反的模式。安全启动可以增强高焦虑个体对依恋相关词汇的通达性(Gokce & Harma, 2018), 减少对创伤记忆的回忆(Bryant & Foord, 2016), 降低对应激和消极情绪的易感性(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Schoemann, Gillath, & Sesko, 2012), 以及提高共情水平(Cassidy, Stern, Mikulincer, Martin, & Shaver, 2018)。同时, 在人际互动层面, 高焦虑个体在安全启动后更倾向于维持关系, 更少解除关系, 对社会联结强度和关系多重性的评分更高(Gillath, Karantzas, & Selcuk, 2017), 并更少使用自我责备(self-blame)分手策略(Collins & Gillath, 2012)。以上研究均未在低焦虑个体中发现安全启动效应。

与上述发现类似, 安全依恋启动效应与依恋回避间也存在不同的交互作用模式。有研究发现, 低回避个体更容易受安全依恋启动影响。在个体水平, 对于低回避个体, 安全启动会提高其共情记忆的通达性 (Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001), 减少创伤记忆闯入(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Bryant & Foord, 2016), 增强情绪体验的积极性并降低压力易感性(Bryant & Bali, 2018; Bryant & Chan, 2017; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Schoemann et al., 2012)。在人际互动水平, 安全启动后, 低回避个体更倾向于寻求物质支持和精神支持(Gillath et al., 2006), 维持网络社交关系(Gillath et al., 2017)。但也有研究发现了相反的模式, 即高回避个体更容易受安全依恋启动效应影响。安全启动会降低高回避个体从遗憾中习得教训的感觉(Schoemann et al., 2012), 降低解除关系的倾向(Gillath et al., 2017), 降低其使用回避/退缩分手策略的倾向(Collins & Gillath, 2012), 并提高对他人需要的反应性(Mikulincer, Shaver, Sahdra, & Bar-On, 2013)。

此外, 安全依恋启动对依恋焦虑和依恋回避得分的影响也不同, 研究采用重复启动范式发现, 安全启动会降低个体焦虑维度得分, 而对回避维度得分无影响(Hudson & Fraley, 2018)。研究者还探究了依恋类型与安全依恋启动的交互作用。研究发现焦虑型个体更容易从安全启动中获益, 如安全启动后焦虑型个体对痛苦强度的评分更低(Pan, Zhang, Liu, Ran, & Teng, 2017), 更多向他人寻求安慰(Evraire, Ludmer, & Dozois, 2014), 而对其他不安全依恋类型个体甚至会产生消极影响, 如安全启动会提高恐惧型个体对痛苦强度的评分(Pan et al., 2017), 减少回避型个体向他人寻求安慰的倾向(Evraire et al., 2014)。此外, 其他因素也会调节两者间的交互作用, 如在非压力条件下, 安全启动可以提高恐惧型个体对抽象材料的喜爱程度, 而在威胁情境下, 则对其无显著影响(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001)。

不安全依恋启动可分为依恋威胁启动、依恋焦虑启动和依恋回避启动。威胁启动通过向被试呈现与依恋相关的威胁刺激(如分离相关图片、记忆等)影响个体依恋系统(Gabriel et al., 2010; Marks & Vicary, 2016; Rosenthal et al., 2012)。威胁刺激并未直接激活某一具体的依恋图式, 而是使依恋系统处于激活状态(Bretherton, 1985), 随后个体长期通达性最高的依恋表征或图式将被激活, 被激活图式或表征将驱动接下来的加工过程。依恋焦虑启动和回避启动则旨在激活与依恋焦虑和依恋回避相关的图式, 进而暂时改变个体当前依恋状态(Boag & Carnelley, 2016; Jarvinen & Paulus, 2017; Melen, Pepping, & O'Donovan, 2017)。

威胁启动效应与依恋焦虑和依恋回避之间均存在不同的交互作用模式。对于威胁启动效应与依恋焦虑的关系, 有研究发现, 威胁启动会影响低焦虑个体而不会影响高焦虑个体, 如威胁启动会降低低焦虑个体对浪漫性爱的渴望, 而对高焦虑个体的影响不显著(Birnbaum et al., 2011)。但也有研究发现, 威胁启动会影响高焦虑个体, 而对低焦虑个体则无影响, 如威胁启动会降低高焦虑个体对距离相关词汇的通达性(Marks & Vicary, 2016), 对抽象材料评分的积极程度(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001), 而在低焦虑个体中则无显著效应。对于威胁启动效应与依恋回避的关系, 有研究发现威胁启动会影响低回避个体而不会影响高回避个体, 如威胁启动会提高低回避个体对依恋对象名字的通达性(Mikulincer, Gillath, & Shaver, 2002), 而高回避个体则不然。也有研究发现了与之相反的模式, 威胁启动下男性回避水平越高其对伴侣照片的注意广度越大, 注意越不集中(Dewitte & Koster, 2014), 同时, 威胁启动会降低高回避女性的性欲望, 提高高回避男性的性欲望(Birnbaum et al., 2011), 而对低回避个体无影响。此外, 目标任务性质也会影响威胁启动与依恋回避之间的交互作用, 如个体对不同词汇的反应任务中, 威胁启动后回避水平越高个体对依恋对象相关词汇的通达性越低, 而对中性词和非词, 则不存在交互作用(Granqvist et al., 2012)。

除依恋维度外, 研究者还考察了威胁启动效应与依恋类型的交互作用, 但相关研究较少。研究发现在威胁启动条件下, 安全型个体反应更加开放和激进, 而不安全个体则更加保守, 如威胁启动后安全型个体更倾向于支持自由派候选人, 而不安全个体更倾向于支持保守派候选人(Weise et al., 2008)。此外, 目标任务性质和个体状态等会影响两者间的交互作用。对于目标任务性质, 在威胁启动条件下, 安全型、回避型和焦虑型个体对依恋相关词汇的通达性无差异; 而对于心理距离词汇, 焦虑型和安全型个体显著高于回避型个体。认知负荷也会影响两者的交互作用, 在低认知负荷条件下, 回避型个体对心理词汇的反应与安全型类似, 而在高认知负荷条件下, 回避型与焦虑型个体的反应均快于安全型个体(Mikulincer, Birnbaum, Woddis, & Nachmias, 2000)。

在不安全启动研究中, 对依恋焦虑启动与依恋回避启动与特质性依恋之间交互作用的研究相对较少, 但研究发现焦虑依恋启动与特质性依恋, 特别是与依恋焦虑存在交互作用。研究发现, 焦虑启动会提高低焦虑个体的进食量, 而对高焦虑个体无显著影响(Wilkinson, Rowe, & Heath, 2013)。再者, 依恋焦虑启动会降低高焦虑男性对亲密的渴望, 并使其在性幻想中的自我和他人表征更加消极(Birnbaum, Simpson, Weisberg, Barnea, & Assulin-Simhon, 2012)。值得注意的是, 有研究发现重复焦虑启动会降低高焦虑个体的焦虑水平(Hudson & Fraley, 2018)。这可能是因为该研究中焦虑启动采用了回忆叙事范式, 对消极关系的反思可能帮助焦虑个体修通其与亲密关系相关的负性信念和预期(Fredrickson, Cohn, Coffey, Pek, & Finkel, 2008)。此外, 焦虑启动可能会使回避型个体采用的抑制激活策略失效, 研究发现, 焦虑启动会提高高回避个体在共情情境下体验到的个人压力(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001), 这可能是因为回忆范式下要求回忆与亲密关系相关的消极记忆构成了额外威胁, 损害了其回避策略的使用(Mikulincer & Florian, 2001)。

尽管上述研究均稳健地表明, 特质性依恋与依恋启动引发的状态性依恋之间存在交互作用, 但也有许多研究表明无论在个体层面还是人际层面, 依恋二重特征的效应彼此独立, 即依恋启动效应独立于个体特质性依恋。在个体层面, 研究发现个体对威胁刺激的反应, 无论以心率、皮肤电活动还是以表情为指标, 安全依恋启动与依恋焦虑和回避维度均不存在交互作用(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Stupica et al., 2018), 且安全启动对反应抑制和挫折引起的情绪反应的影响也独立于依恋两维度(Karreman, Vingerhoets, & Bekker, 2019; Li et al., 2016)。同时, 安全依恋启动后, 个体在自传记忆回忆连贯性、具体性, 消极记忆闯入, 积极情绪通达性, 对挫折的情绪反应, 负性情绪管理中的表现均不受依恋维度的影响(Bryant & Bali, 2018; Bryant & Foord, 2016; Clear & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2017; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001)。而在人际互动层面也得到了一致结果, 关于浪漫嫉妒、网络攻击行为、偏见、人际应激、人格化策略、共情、帮助寻求和为他人提供帮助和支持等的研究均发现启动效应独立于个体特质性依恋(Bartz, Tchalova, & Fenerci, 2016; Gillath et al., 2006; Liu, Huo, Chen, & Song, 2018; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer et al., 2013; Pardess, Mikulincer, Dekel, & Shaver, 2014; Saleem et al., 2015; Selterman & Maier, 2013)。如对于他人需要的共情反应, 安全启动效应和特质性依恋分别独立挥发作用, 安全启动会增加个体在共情情境中自我报告的共情反应, 而依恋焦虑和回避会降低共情反应, 且两者之间不存在交互作用(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001)。

除安全启动的研究外, 不安全启动研究也发现特质性依恋与状态性依恋之间不存在交互作用。研究发现威胁启动会提高对依恋对象名字的通达性, 如母亲和离世的亲人, 且该效应独立于依恋焦虑和依恋回避(Carr & Landau, 2012; Mancini & Bonanno, 2012; Mikulincer et al., 2002)。再者, 压力启动会提高个体对亲近相关观念的通达性(Mikulincer et al., 2000)。此外, 关于个体对与上帝相关观念的认知开放性, 研究发现依恋焦虑启动、回避启动和安全启动与依恋回避和焦虑无交互作用(Jarvinen & Paulus, 2017)。可见, 无论安全依恋启动还是不安全依恋启动条件下均有研究发现依恋二重特征间不存在交互作用。

实证研究表明特质性依恋和依恋启动效应之间的关系模式十分复杂, 甚至存在方向相反的交互作用模式, 仅仅将这些不一致结果归因为误差显然并不合适。如何厘清这些复杂的结果, 并用同一理论框架进行解释, 有助于研究者对依恋二重特征的性质、功能及其之间的关系有更清晰、深入的认识。传统依恋理论主要包括两部分：(1)规范部分(normative aspect), 该部分主要是关于依恋系统及其发展的常态和普遍特征; (2)个体差异部分, 该部分主要是关于依恋系统运作的个体差异(Bowlby, 1969/1982)。与之对应, Mikulincer和Shaver (2016a)为解释情境刺激对个体依恋心理和行为的影响提出了依恋系统激活两阶段模型, 该模型为整合和解释上述复杂的交互作用模式提供了框架。

Mikulincer和Shaver (2016a)认为, 一旦个体评估发现情境中存在威胁, 依恋系统就会被自动激活, 该激活过程包括两个阶段。第一阶段, 威胁评估将导致依恋系统的潜意识激活, 并自动化地增强对依恋相关表征、想法和行为倾向的通达性。依恋系统激活的第一阶段与传统依恋理论中规范部分相对应, 该部分的核心观点是个体在感受到威胁时, 无论个体特质性依恋特征如何, 依恋系统均会被激活(Bowlby, 1969/1982)。不安全启动研究为该观点提供了证据, 研究发现在威胁启动或依恋焦虑和依恋回避启动条件下, 个体对依恋对象和亲近相关表征的通达性提高, 且该效应独立于依恋焦虑和回避维度得分(Carr & Landau, 2012; Jarvinen & Paulus, 2017)。既然依恋系统激活第一阶段的结果是激活依恋和亲密相关依恋表征, 提高其通达性, 那么直接激活这些依恋相关表征也应产生类似的效果。研究发现安全启动刺激会提高依恋相关表征的通达性 (Bryant & Bali, 2018), 抑制负性表征和负性情绪的激活, 提高情绪的积极性(Bryant & Foord, 2016; Clear & Zimmer- Gembeck, 2017)。这些被激活的积极表征和情绪将主导个体当前的心智状态, 使个体以更加积极、灵活和开放的方式应对威胁 (Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Stupica et al., 2018), 进行人际互动(Bartz et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Pardess et al., 2014; Saleem et al., 2015; Selterman & Maier, 2013)。无论是威胁刺激激活依恋系统, 提高亲密等依恋表征的通达性, 还是直接激活依恋安全相关表征, 两种方式均能对个体后续的心理和行为产生影响。尽管依恋理论的规范部分认为无论个体依恋特征如何, 个体在感知到威胁时依恋系统均会被自动激活, 但个体对情境刺激的评估可能受个体特质性依恋的影响, 所以Mikulicner和Shaver (2016a)认为该阶段依恋系统激活受过度激活和抑制激活依恋策略相关的兴奋性和抑制性环路影响。该观点也得到了实证研究的支持, 如威胁启动会提高低回避个体对依恋对象名字的通达性, 而对高回避个体无影响(Mikulincer et al., 2002), 还有研究发现, 威胁启动会降低高焦虑个体积极情绪激活, 而对低焦虑个体无影响(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001); 类似地, 研究发现安全启动可以提高低焦虑和低回避个体共情记忆的通达性, 而对高焦虑和高回避个体无影响(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001)。

第二阶段, 依恋相关心理表征的潜意识激活可以塑造个体当前的心理状态, 甚至在个体意识到之前影响个体的行为计划(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016), 并且这些被激活表征将唤起有意识的、与亲密寻求相关的想法, 主导个体接下来的活动, 并在很多情况下转化为寻求亲密和保护的可见行为。在该阶段个体基于依恋经验形成的特质性依恋将发挥更大作用, 换句话说, 该阶段依恋个体差异将表现得更加明显。特质性依恋与依恋启动效应表现出不同交互作用模式可能与具有不同特质性依恋特征个体偏好的依恋表征和策略有关。依恋安全个体(低焦虑和低回避)通常采用安全基地策略, 并表现出积极的信息加工和人际互动, 而高焦虑和高回避个体则分别偏好过度激活策略和抑制激活策略, 表现出消极的信息加工和人际互动(Dykas & Cassidy, 2011)。

依恋焦虑反映了个体在需要时重要他人可得的程度以及害怕被拒绝和抛弃的程度(Moura- Ramos, Santos, & Canavaro, 2017)。高焦虑个体通常使用过度激活策略, 表现为长期对依恋信息保持高度警觉, 并伴随强烈的忧虑且努力、强迫性地获得依恋对象的爱和支持(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016b)。无论个体依恋焦虑水平如何, 安全启动均可提高个体依恋基地相关表征和情绪通达性(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Gokce & Harma, 2018; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001)。但高焦虑个体依恋表征通达性通常处于较高水平, 故低焦虑个体相对高焦虑个体更容易表现出安全启动效应。再者, 安全启动条件下个体安全基地相关表征激活水平提高, 高焦虑个体将体验到更强的依恋安全感, 进而使其之后的认知和行为表现更加积极(Bryant & Foord, 2016; Cassidy et al., 2018; Schoemann et al., 2012)。而低焦虑个体依恋安全水平相对较高, 安全启动对其影响更小, 所以在这种情况下高焦虑个体更容易出现安全依恋启动效应。研究发现安全启动在高焦虑个体中会产生两种不同结果：(1)安全启动能够给高焦虑个体带来积极效应, 使其无论在信息加工还是人际互动中的表现更加积极、具有适应性(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Cassidy et al., 2018; Gillath et al., 2017; Gokce & Harma, 2018); (2)安全启动并不影响高焦虑个体的表现(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer et al., 2011)。产生以上两种不同结果可能是因为焦虑型个体的依恋表征网络内既包括与依恋安全、亲密相关的积极表征, 也包括不安全依恋相关的消极表征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007)。因此, 若安全启动刺激激活积极表征, 则会产生安全启动效应, 若安全启动刺激让被试联想到消极经验, 激活消极表征, 则个体不会表现出安全启动效应, 甚至产生消极影响(Mallinckrodt et al., 2013)。在不安全依恋启动, 特别是威胁启动条件下, 高焦虑个体感受到更高的不安全感, 此时个体将采用防御性策略应对威胁, 进而使得之后的认知和行为更加消极, 如情绪体验更加消极(Mikulincer, Hirschberger et al., 2001)。而低焦虑个体安全水平较高, 能够更加积极地应对威胁(Rosenthal et al., 2012), 更少表现出不适应性行为(Birnbaum et al., 2011)。值得注意的是, Hudson和Fraley (2018)研究发现重复焦虑启动会降低高焦虑个体的焦虑水平。这可能是因为研究采用回忆叙事范式, 对消极关系的反思可能帮助焦虑个体修通其与亲密关系相关的负性信念和预期(Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991; Fredrickson et al., 2008)。由此可推断, 在阈上条件下依恋不安全启动的效应在很大程度上取决于个体对启动刺激的主观评估, 这与Mikulincer和Shaver (2016)的观点一致。

依恋回避反映了个体努力维持行为独立及与重要他人维持情绪距离的程度(Moura-Ramos et al., 2017), 高回避个体倾向于使用抑制激活策略, 通过抑制依恋系统激活避免可能产生的痛苦(Dykas & Cassidy, 2011; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016)。当安全启动效应体现为提高个体依恋相关的认知和行为表现时, 低回避个体更容易表现出安全启动效应。低回避个体依恋安全感较高, 在安全启动条件下能够以更开放、积极的方式应对威胁、进行信息加工和人际互动(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Bryant & Foord, 2016; Gillath et al., 2017; Gillath et al., 2006; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer et al., 2011)。而高回避个体在面对威胁时, 通常采用抑制激活策略, 抑制对依恋相关刺激的通达性(Dewitte & Koster, 2014; Granqvist et al., 2012), 因此更不容易表现出安全启动效应。当安全启动效应体现为降低个体依恋相关消极行为时, 高回避更容易表现出安全启动效应(Collins & Gillath, 2012; Gillath et al., 2017; Mikulincer et al., 2013)。这可能是因为低回避个体通常能以积极的方式进行依恋相关的信息加工和人际互动, 消极行为相对较少, 因而更不容表现出安全启动效应。应注意, 高回避个体面对的“威胁”是经个体主观评价的结果, 即使客观刺激性质是安全的, 但若个体将其评价为威胁的, 也将驱使其采用抑制激活策略(Evraire et al., 2014)。但抑制激活策略并非在任何情境下均有效, 当该策略需要的认知资源被占用时就会失效, 研究表明该策略在低认知负荷下有效, 而在高认知负荷下则会失效(Mikulincer et al., 2000)。

综上, 安全启动效应主要体现在两个方面, 提高安全依恋个体依恋相关的适应性心理和行为表现, 降低不安全个体与依恋相关的消极认知和行为表现。而对于威胁启动, 依恋安全个体通常可以有效应对威胁刺激, 而高焦虑和高回避个体分别倾向于采用过度激活和抑制激活策略应对威胁。个体特质性依恋特征及启动刺激引起的状态性依恋特征共同影响了个体在具体情境中的表现。

个体在某一情境中表现出的依恋心理和行为是特质性依恋与情境引发状态性依恋相互作用、共同决定的。个体依恋模式处于稳定性与变化性之间张力的平衡中。依恋特征的二重性既保证了个体的同一性, 也使个体对环境的反应具有适应性。特质性依恋与依恋启动效应的多种交互作用模式为理解依恋二重性提供了实证证据, 依恋系统激活两阶段模型为理解、整合这些结果提供了框架。但在该领域仍然存在许多分歧和不足, 需要未来进一步研究。

当前采用依恋启动范式对于依恋二重性关系的研究存在的一个问题是大部分依恋启动研究未提供操作检验, 在这种情况下研究者更多通过结果事后推测依恋启动的有效性, 但并未提供直接证据证明依恋启动的有效性。这是因为操作检验可能引起被试对实验目的的猜测或降低本来就较弱的启动效应, 进而影响实验结果(Birnbaum et al., 2012)。Birnbaum等(2012)在研究中额外招募了一组被试只用于启动有效性的检验, 他们要求被试在启动完成后评价自己害怕被抛弃的程度, 结果表明焦虑启动组评分显著高于安全启动组。Schoemann等(2012)通过对被试在依恋想象启动任务中想象内容进行编码和分析确保被试进行了相应的想象, 但他们也未直接检验启动效应。Deng等(2016)通过实验组与控制组在完成启动任务后对当下感到安全、温暖、支持和想要给别人拥抱的程度的评分检验安全激活程度; 而Pan等(2017)通过启动前后的状态依恋问卷得分比较检验了启动效应。上述方法只可用于阈上依恋启动效应的操作检验, 不适用于阈下启动方法的检验。将来研究者应进一步优化阈上启动效应的检验方法, 同时发展适用于阈下启动效应的检验方法。

当前关于依恋二重性关系的研究多采用依恋焦虑和依恋回避两维度得分作为个体特质性依恋的指标。研究之所以多采用依恋维度描述个体特质性依恋是因其在某些方面更具优势(Fraley et al., 2015)。但当前依恋研究很多研究常分别对焦虑和回避进行单独分析, 而未考虑两者之间的交互作用(Gillath et al., 2015; Marks & Vicary, 2016; Mikulincer et al., 2014)。但有研究发现在依恋启动、依恋焦虑和依恋回避之间存在三者交互作用, 如Pan等(2017)发现对焦虑维度得分较高者, 若其回避维度得分高于一个标准差, 则安全依恋启动会降低其对痛苦图片的评分, 若其回避维度得分低于一个标准差则会提高其评分; 而低焦虑得分个体无论其回避维度得分如何, 均未发现启动效应。Schoemann等(2012)也发现了安全依恋启动与焦虑和回避间的三者交互作用, 安全启动可以降低高焦虑-低回避个体的遗憾感, 而对其他被试无显著影响; 同时安全依恋启动可以提高高焦虑-高回避个体通过错误学习的感觉, 而降低低焦虑-高回避个体通过错误学习的感觉, 并对其他类型的被试无显著影响。将来依恋启动研究中采用依恋维度测量个体特质性依恋时, 应考虑两维度间的交互作用。

目前研究中高焦虑与依恋启动效应存在不同的作用模式。有研究发现不安全启动会给高焦虑个体带来负面影响, 如降低情绪积极性和对同伴团体的认同等(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001; Rosenthal et al., 2012), 增加高焦虑个体的消极情绪体验(Mallinckrodt et al., 2013), 有研究

则表明高焦虑个体不受不安全启动的影响(Birnbaum et al., 2011), 甚至Hudson和Fraley (2018)发现重复焦虑启动会降低高焦虑个体的焦虑水平。这些不一致结果可能与焦虑型个体依恋表征的复杂性有关。焦虑个体的依恋表征可能是双效价的, 既有积极表征, 也有消极表征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007)。激活不同表征可能会产生不同结果, 将来研究应关注焦虑个体依恋表征的双效价性, 采用更具针对性的启动材料, 进一步揭示高焦虑与依恋启动效应产生不同作用模式的原因。

根据依恋系统激活的两阶段模型, 从激活依恋系统的刺激呈现至个体做出反应存在两个过程(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016)。第一阶段更多是自动化的, 而第二阶段个体特质性依恋将发挥更大作用。回避型个体倾向于采用抑制策略而焦虑型个体通常采用过度激活策略, 但这些依恋应对策略在信息加工中何时发挥作用仍不清晰。依恋策略是在个体对刺激进行评估时发挥作用, 还是在评估后做出反应时才发挥作用?未来研究应从信息加工时间进程角度对该问题进一步研究。此外, 依恋策略发挥作用是否需要意识参与也值得关注。研究发现阈下启动在创造性问题解决表现中, 启动效应独立于个体依恋特质性, 而在阈上启动条件下, 低焦虑个体表现出更高的创造性问题解决行为, 而对高焦虑个体无影响(Mikulincer et al., 2011), 这似乎说明个体意识参与是高焦虑个体的依恋策略发挥效用的条件, 这一问题也值得将来研究进一步关注。

# “渴望爱，却充满回避和焦虑” | 恐惧型依恋者的6个迹象_ta_关系_行为


                        由内容质量、互动评论、分享传播等多维度分值决定，勋章级别越高(
                        
                        )，代表其在平台内的综合表现越好。
                    

你身边是否存在这样一种人：

ta渴望亲密，希望能接近潜在的依恋对象（朋友/伴侣），但当那些人靠得太近，ta们会变得非常不舒服，并渴望退出这段关系。

然而，觉察到对方离开，ta又变得焦虑，肝肠寸断。

因此，ta传达给别人的信息其实是：“我喜欢你，但你离我远点”。 

虽然这一类型在人群中的占比较小（约6%），但ta们往往具有最糟糕的情感体验和人际关系。

一些工作模型表明，恐惧型依恋更可能陷入虐待关系，与较高的边缘人格障碍、解离症状、孤独、抑郁风险相关。

恐惧型依恋者常具有如下【6个特征】：

1）情绪和行为不稳定且不可预测

当一个人处于“恐惧型”的状态下，ta既担心被抛弃，又对亲密感到不适。

换句话说，ta们没有“对亲密的应对方式”——ta想接近的潜在亲密对象，也是ta害怕接近的人。在关系中，这种行为常引起误会，让人迷惑不解。

2）对重要他人的“理想化”和“愤怒”

研究表明，恐惧依恋的成年人会防御性地组织行为，对重要他人出现“理想化（要求一个完美的伴侣）”和“愤怒”的交替情绪，以尽量减少被拒绝的痛苦。

比如为了不被拒绝，宁愿孤独地过日子。努力减少与他人的情感接触，同时又要延续关系。



3）拥有极度情绪化的关系

在情绪调节方面，恐惧依恋者往往比其他不安全类型的人更麻烦）。

比如，很难从愤怒中平静下来，或容易感到强烈的“被排斥感”……无法应对情绪上的“压倒性来袭”时，可能会做出一些破坏人际关系的行为。

4）ta可能有很多的性伴侣

☞ 一项跟踪600人近40年的研究发现，“恐惧依恋”可以预测个人一生中更多的性伴侣数量，以及更大的性依从性（sexual compliance，即遵从伴侣的性欲望）。对男女来说都是如此。

因为ta们渴望爱，却害怕亲密，而偶然的性关系可以让ta们置于这种处境：

性活动既增加了亲密度，逃离可能导致抑郁的想法，也让ta们在感情上保持距离。

5）ta们更易出现攻击和控制行为

相对其他不安全的依恋类型，恐惧依恋的男性更容易对女性产生敌意、配偶虐待和儿童性虐待。

6）缺乏自尊，有强烈的拒绝恐惧

从性别维度看，女性比男性更容易产生恐惧依恋。在女性样本中，恐惧依恋者具有“低自尊、沮丧和强烈的注意力需要”。

她们的共同点是，对他人有深深的不信任，不愿意寻求专业帮助。这可能与她们负面的自我看法和强烈的拒绝恐惧有关。

心理学博士Hal Shorey认为，恐惧依恋的成人，一般在童年时期有过至少一名养育者出现过“可怕的养育行为”。

这会在孩子体内产生一种对自身安全的恐惧——孩子下意识地觉察到，照顾者不能满足自己的需要。

然而，父母并不一定具备主观敌意。有精神疾病的家长也同样会让孩子感到害怕——因为孩子知道父母没有能力保护自己。

从神经生物学观点看，一些具有恐惧依恋对象的儿童，甚至可能无法全面发展出整合性的神经结构，导致成年后的情绪失调问题。

换句话说，孩子生来依恋父母，却不能将依恋者视为“安全基地”。

在以后的生活中，ta们会创造出一个想要亲密的人，但同时也会创造出一个害怕亲密的人。



1）克服对安全感的恐惧，寻求一段安全的关系

比如谈恋爱，大约50%的成年人拥有安全型依恋模式，几率其实还不错。

在新的关系中，你可以挑战自己的防御能力，并努力在这种关系中发展自己。

或者去见心理咨询师。心理咨询师会成为关系中的“安全基地”，与来访者重新建立一种新的、可靠的、具有接纳性的依恋关系，整合创伤，促进个人资源的整合。

2）为自己的经历写一个连贯的故事

依恋研究表明，儿童依恋类型的最佳预测因素并不是“父母经历了何种创伤”，而是“父母如何理解、解决这些创伤”。

对于未解决的创伤，一个很关键的做法是为自己创建连贯叙述的过程。重新讲述自己的故事本身，就可以“增强”安全感和个人心理弹性。

3）放下受害者模式，每个人都应为自己的选择负责

这个话题，算是老生常谈了。在亲密关系里，对对方总是不满意，但还选择关系继续的，那定是这段关系还有继续的价值。

归根结底，放弃还是继续，这是你权衡之后做出的一个选择。每个人都应为自己的选择负责。

如果你总觉得这个选择是被迫的，无奈的，只能两害相权取其轻，但又让自己陷入纠结、矛盾、焦虑或者抑郁之中，那你就要重新审视一下：这个选择对吗？我有能力去做出改变吗？

如果你自己没有答案，那这恰恰是你需要成长的一个点，你如果凭一己之力无法穿越，请及时求助专业的心理咨询师帮助。

你要清楚一点：我自身的问题，需要我自己去面对、去解决。

摘要： 传统依恋理论认为个体依恋心理和行为模式具有相对稳定性, 但无论在信息加工还是个体发展过程中, 个体依恋模式均表现出二重性, 即既具有相对稳定性, 又具有情境敏感性。个体在情境中所表现出的依恋模式是个体相对稳定的特质性依恋和情境特征相互作用的结果。依恋启动研究中特质性依恋特征与依恋启动效应之间的交互作用模式为理解依恋二重特征及其关系提供了窗口。依恋系统激活的两阶段模型为整合和解释这些相互作用模式提供了框架。未来研究应优化依恋二重特征关系研究中启动效应的操作检验, 考虑依恋焦虑和回避维度的交互作用, 关注高焦虑群体内的依恋差异, 以理析依恋二重特征之间的相互作用方式, 同时关注依恋策略影响依恋启动效应的时间进程, 探究依恋二重特征相互作用的机制。

Abstract: Traditional attachment theory suggests that an individual’s attachment-related psychological and behavioral patterns are relatively stable. However, from information processes or life-span development perspective, attachment patterns have trait-state duality, i.e. attachment patterns are both relatively stable and context-sensitive. An individual’s attachment pattern in a particular context is the consequence of his or her trait attachment and contextual feature interactions. The interaction patterns between trait attachment and attachment priming effects provide a window to understand the duality of attachment and their relationships. And the two-stages model of attachment activation offers a framework for integrating and understanding these patterns. Future studies should optimize the manipulation check of attachment priming, meanwhile, take the interaction between attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety in consideration. More attention should be paid to the individual differences in the high attachment anxiety group which may clarify the patterns of interaction between trait and state attachment. Moreover, the time course of how attachment coping strategies impact the effects of attachment priming should be concerned, which could reveal the mechanism of the interactions between trait and state attachment.

# 亲密关系中的识别情绪模式 | 你是哪种“依恋类型”？ • 6秒钟情商官网

 由 Huang, Chamie | 7 月 3, 2020 | 6秒钟, 生活情商 | 0 条评论

每个人都有一些“好模式”和“坏模式”，如果我们不想一次又一次地重复同样的错误，首先要做的就是意识到“问题出在哪里”。本篇文章帮助我们探索自己在亲密关系中的模式，并了解这些模式是如何影响着我们建立和打破关系。

伴侣之间有时会发生争吵，虽然这种场景不常发生，但每一次都很伤人。

妻子回家发现家里有几处衣服，于是抱怨了一句：“你为什么每次都把衣服乱扔！？”，两个人开始为此进行对话，在你一言我一语的过程中，和“反抗”相关的模式被激活，为了证明自己才是对的那一个，对话升级为争吵。

丈夫可能因此被压得喘不过气来，需要独处才能回到安全和爱的状态。妻子可能因此委屈地哭泣，继续不断地诉说，需要一个肯定回应才能安定心神。

依恋类型 Attachment Style

“依恋类型”这个概念最早是由英国精神病学家鲍尔比(John Bowlby，1969)提出的，他将依恋定义为“个体与具有特殊意义的他人形成牢固的情感纽带的倾向，能为个体提供安全和安慰”。

鲍尔比最早提出依恋这个概念主要是用来解释婴儿与其养护者之间的情感联系，但后来的研究者们将之扩展到了成人之间。

现在依恋(Attachment)主要指：个体与主要抚养者发展出的一种特殊的、积极的情感纽带，也是指个体寻求并企图与另一个体在身体和情感上保持亲密联系的倾向。

阅读以下描述，看看你属于三种类型中的哪种依恋类型？

◈ 焦虑（对抗）型 Anxious-resistant

你需要从伴侣那里得到许多关注才能感觉到被爱。你经常会有一种“距离感”，你可能讨厌带着愤怒说晚安，你需要先解决争吵，才能再次感到“完整”。可能表现的比较“黏人”或“需要帮助”。

◈ 安全型 Secure

你乐于给予和接受关注，与对方距离太远或太近时，你都意识到，然后会要求更多的空间或更多的关注来让自己感到舒服。你认定的事情不会因他人的行为而受到影响。

◈ 回避型 Avoidant

你非常重视独立和个人空间，可能不太愿意给予或接受感情。当一段感情开始后，你很快就会意识到这需要你放弃独立，所以可能难长时间维持一段感情。你可能会听到他人评价你有些自私或冷漠。

在这些描述中，你认出自己和伴侣了吗？每个依恋类型都会有相似的一些“模式”，而在亲密关系中，每个人也可以通过脱离自动驾驶模式，有意识地选择或改变自己的模式，来更好的支持彼此。

接下来，一起看一些故事和例子吧。

 

焦虑对抗型 vs 回避型 

在争论期间，回避型Andy想要独处的空间，而焦虑对抗型Judy却想要在一起。花了一段时间，他们终于认识到双方的不同模式。当Andy发现自己不知所措时，他想找到最近的出口，独处一段时间。而Judy感到难过时，希望自己可以更多的被关注和照顾。Andy和Judy共同讨论两人的模式，并运用同理心去理解对方的观点，他们商量出一个共同的策略。

当他们吵架时，Andy会有一段自己的时间，可以是30分钟，3个小时，一天……但需要事先告知Judy。时间到了后，Andy会充满能量的回来。而Judy知道了Andy的独处时间是多久，她会因此感到安全。在这段时间里，她能够专注于自己，比如与家人聊天、和朋友逛街等。Judy也会轻轻地提醒Andy，他们有一个共同的约定。在这种情况下，他们两个互相满足了对方的需求。

回避型 vs 回避型 

Lucy和Peter都是回避型的依恋类型，很多时候他们都宁愿一个人呆着。尽管他们都非常重视稳定以及家人关系，但他们很容易忘记保持良好的关系需要一些情感上的工作。于是他们发现双方的模式后，共同讨论了一个策略。

他们每周安排一次时间，以情侣的身份进行连接。他们共同撰写了一份文件，表达对方自己有多重要，在争论之后回看这份文件。除此之外，他们优先考虑各自的独处时间，有时也会利用这个时间来表达对彼此的爱。Lucy会为Peter写爱情日记，而Peter则会用心为Lucy挑选礼物。为了避免自己忽略对方的需求和感受，他们还找到了可信赖的咨询师来支持他们。他们虽然都是回避型，但也可以通过一起学习，相互支持，来体会爱这样一件美好、安全的事情。

焦虑对抗型 vs 焦虑对抗型 

John和Jane都是焦虑对抗型，平时他们甜蜜得似胶如漆，彼此间充满爱意。于是在争执时，他们都会希望得到对方的关注。但驾驭情绪对于同样是焦虑型的Jane和John，都很挑战，因此，为了更好地谈论和验证情绪，他们也共同制定了一个策略。

一旦有谁感到受伤，先准确地表达自己的感受，而不是使用置气、抱怨的方式进行交流，此时另一方需要表达爱、安全和谅解。这样不仅能共同满足彼此的需求，他们也体会到爱不一定是要每时每刻在一起，独处时也可以从自己的内心感受到爱与支持，并再稳定地给予对方。

不论是什么依恋类型，也不论是什么样的模式，建立长期幸福关系的技巧很简单：确保满足每个人的需求。识别情绪模式也不是为了改变，而是更有意识地选择更合适的回应。

那么，你在亲密关系中是属于哪种依恋类型？你的伴侣呢？针对你们相处的模式，可以共同制定什么样策略来让彼此的感情更为长久和稳定？

忽远忽近、患得患失，敏感多疑，可能是焦虑型依恋在作祟……

​

 

依恋理论（Attachment theory）最早由英国心理学家John Bowlby所提出，指个体与具有特殊意义的他人形成牢固的情感纽带，提供安全感与安慰，具体可分为安全型、回避型、焦虑型、恐惧型四种。与儿童期的单纯依恋不同（婴儿-照料者），成人间的依恋关系显然更为复杂；不论是日常交友、与父母关系、与子女联结，或是亲密伴侣间的相处，都往往让人心生为难。似乎总有人是天生的社交牛人，可以游刃有余在各类关系间承担责任获得平衡，维持安全型依恋关系。也有一类人，心思细腻、敏感共情、缺少安全感、时而粘人，但同时又害怕被抛弃而故意主动回避，这就是典型的焦虑型依恋人格。

焦虑型依恋人格（anxious-resistant attachment）是指会在关系中极度渴望与对方建立亲密关系，发展稳定，但始终担忧与恐惧对方无法满足自己的期待，建立真正的关系。在这种焦虑下，总会认为自己是付出更多的一方，即使对方给出回应，也还是无法完全确定对方心意，幻想着、害怕着自己随时被抛弃的狼狈。

 

在亲密关系中，焦虑型依恋人格会有如下表现：

​

焦虑型依恋人群内心细腻，非常关注他人的情绪与表现，希望所有人可以舒适与满意，并会经常设身处地想象对方的想法与感受。因此，他们非常需要对方给到的反馈，“自己是否被接纳”、“自己是否让他人满意”、“自己表现是否得体”对他们是非常重要的话题。他们也会思考烦恼许多，纠结是保持自身特点还是迎合他人想法，但终是难以遵从本心，他们认为只有成为大家心中的样子，才不会孤身一人，合群、配合是他们牢记在心的事。

​

因为太害怕被放弃被抛弃，焦虑型依恋的人可能往往陷于自己的幻想，心生沮丧，而后产生嫉妒、气愤等一系列负面情绪，导致出现“粘人”的特质；但同时，他们又是天生的反思自省者，冷静过后，会认为自己是病态的疯狂的。于是会再次产生羞愧等情绪，开始选择回避。同时，他们害怕对方强烈的情感输出，逐步将自己封锁起来。在长期独处后，又会再次变得渴望被靠近，寻求亲密关系。长期往复，内耗不断，导致自己和对方越来越疲惫，形成恶性循环。

​

具有依恋型人格的人群常会在一段关系中，付出自己的所有，避免出现被责怪、被抛弃的结局。他们会在给对方很高评价的同时自我贬低，认为自己不够完美、自信心水平较低，认为自己做的还不够好，而后不断进行自我批评，不断强化这类不合理信念。因此，在这种情况下，他们非常需要关系中的另一方给出确认与肯定，以得到“自己是值得被爱的”、“自己是有长处的”、“自己是不可或缺的”。然而当对方给出的信号不够强烈时，他们可能会敏感、脆弱，甚至多疑失望。

除了上述特征外，此类人群可能还会出现：

- 追求完美

- 自我苛责

- 情绪波动起伏大

- 过度独立、过度依赖

- 关心照顾他人

- 很少表明自己诉求（希望对方猜中自身的心思）

- 害怕被批评

 

那么为什么ta/我是焦虑型依恋人格呢？

​

个体的气质与性格以及基因将会影响个体婴儿时期的表现与行为，如，有些婴儿在离开母亲时表现出高度焦虑、反复啼哭不止、有些表现的过度冷漠、又或者较为平淡。抚养者给予的关注强度与方式不同，就会强化不同的行为模式与内心信念，这些行为模式也会始终伴随个体的成长与发展，形成成年后的依恋模式。

在婴儿时期所形成的行为模式与信念又常与原生家庭中的照料者养育风格或抚养风格有关，焦虑型孩子的父母往往在与孩子相处时情绪波动较大，有时非常热情，给到孩子充足的陪伴、鼓励与爱意，但有时又会因为工作等外部压力影响，态度急转直下，时而冷淡、气愤、指责或是与孩子距离逐渐变远。让孩子们产生矛盾感，想要不断确认自己究竟是否被父母爱着，自己的表现究竟如何，导致在情绪上渴求、索取的越来越多。

是否在童年或成长阶段中经历过被抛弃、是否在某段关系中被伤害等可能会使得个体产生恐惧心理，害怕重蹈覆辙，导致焦虑依恋人格形成。以伴侣亲密关系为例，独自一人时，渴望得到另一人的关注与爱意，但是一旦确立关系后，又渴望对方满心满眼皆是你，同时，在被爱着时又担心自己不够完美，焦虑是否又会被舍弃，一边害怕，一边紧攥。

 

​

​

​

依恋类型虽在儿童时期就会得到确立，但也会根据人的成长经历与个人心理信念更替而不断发展，因此，依恋模式并非是一成不变的，如果你或者身边的ta恰巧也是焦虑型依恋人格，可以从以下方面做出调整：

认识自己的情绪状态，不让瞬间的悲伤、气愤逐步放大并支配自身，当你发现自己或者对方快要失控时，请尝试停下来冷静的帮助自己或对方感知情绪并反思，它从何而来，为何突然袭来，往往情绪过激的背后并不是真正的指责或厌恶，只是单纯渴求安全感与爱意。

调整自己的沟通模式，告诉对方自己的真实想法，坦诚告诉对方你所在意或渴望被满足的需求，减少让对方猜测的机会。说出你在焦虑什么、为何会焦虑、自己做出了哪些努力、希望对方理解哪些部分，告知对方你的期待会让自己和他人更为轻松与安全。如果对方无法满足，也请别责怪自己，也许只是因为ta和你不够适合陪伴彼此。

积累他人对你的爱意、积累他人对你的肯定、积累自己的正向评价、积累自己的开心瞬间，当焦虑袭来时，可以开始回想生活中的美好，给到自己力量与正向暗示，为自己赋能。

也许，帮助自身或者帮助他人偶尔力不从心，请不用担心，你可以寻求心理咨询等专业人员帮助，抽丝剥茧，认识到行为情绪背后所有的触发事件，更好认识自身的潜意识，并提供更为高效专业的方案帮助我们度过纠结、减少痛苦、勇敢促使自身、陪伴他人走出困境，做出改变。

# “我喜欢你，但你离我远点”：恐惧型依恋者的6个迹象-虎嗅网

本文来自微信公众号：简单心理（ID：janelee1231），作者：江湖边，原文标题：《“渴望爱，却充满回避和焦虑”：恐惧型依恋者的6个迹象》，头图来自：《春潮》剧照



你身边是否存在这样一种人：



ta渴望亲密，希望能接近潜在的依恋对象（朋友/伴侣）。



但当那些人靠得太近，ta们会变得非常不舒服，并渴望退出这段关系。然而，觉察到对方离开，ta又变得焦虑，肝肠寸断。



因此，ta传达给别人的信息其实是：“我喜欢你，但你离我远点”。 



be like：







而ta周围的人 ：







1991年，心理学家Bartholomew等人提出，成年人的依恋关系，大致存在4种类型：



安全型（secure）、恐惧型（fearful）、疏离型（dismissing），痴迷型（preoccupied）。







这4种模式的划分基于2个维度：“焦虑（被抛弃）”维度：一个人对自己的看法是积极/消极的；“回避（亲密）”维度：一个人对他人的看法是积极/消极的。



焦虑和回避度都很低，意味着ta们是“安全型依恋者”。ta们对自己和他人都有基本积极的看法，与伴侣亲密相处时感到放松；



剩余3种则都不太安全。



痴迷型依恋者渴望被爱。ta们想要亲密，并很少回避。但由于对自己持消极态度，认为自己不值得好的感情，导致时刻担心被抛弃；



疏离型回避者回避亲密，在交往中习惯保持距离。ta们遇到困难习惯独立解决，认为别人不值得依靠，但积极地看待自己；



恐惧型依恋则最为棘手，ta们的独特之处在于：同时具有“高度焦虑”和“高度回避”特质，对自己和他人都持消极态度。一方面渴望被爱，但由于自我价值低下而认为自己不值得。另一方面又恐惧亲密，在关系中释放“回避”信号。



今天这篇文章，就来聊聊最后一种：恐惧-回避依恋者（也就是开头的例子）。



虽然这一类型在人群中的占比较小（约6%），但ta们往往具有最糟糕的情感体验和人际关系。



一些工作模型表明，恐惧型依恋更可能陷入虐待关系，与较高的边缘人格障碍、解离症状、孤独、抑郁风险相关（Dozier等，1999）。





图/中科院&北同中心



对于这种矛盾处境，David J .Wallin在《心理治疗中的依恋》中打了一个精妙的比喻：



“地下室浓烟滚滚地在着火，而ta拒绝承认从下面传上来的烟味。ta总是处在被淹没的边缘，仿佛在永无休止地等待着另一只鞋掉下来，却不知道那只鞋早已经掉下来过了。”



“不愿意进入亲密关系，但又迫切需要被他人爱”



恐惧型依恋者常具有如下6个特征：



1. 情绪和行为不稳定且不可预测（Sprecher，1998）



当一个人处于“恐惧型”的状态下，ta既担心被抛弃，又对亲密感到不适。



换句话说，ta们没有“对亲密的应对方式”——ta想接近的潜在亲密对象，也是ta害怕接近的人（Khan等，2020年）。在关系中，这种行为常引起误会，让人迷惑不解。







2. 对重要他人的“理想化”和“愤怒”



研究表明，恐惧依恋的成年人会防御性地组织行为，对重要他人出现“理想化（要求一个完美的伴侣）”和“愤怒”的交替情绪，以尽量减少被拒绝的痛苦（Griffin等，1994）。



比如为了不被拒绝，宁愿孤独地过日子。努力减少与他人的情感接触，同时又要延续关系。



3. 拥有极度情绪化的关系



在情绪调节方面，恐惧依恋者往往比其他不安全类型的人更麻烦（Feeney，1999）。



比如，很难从愤怒中平静下来，或容易感到强烈的“被排斥感”……无法应对情绪上的“压倒性来袭”时，可能会做出一些破坏人际关系的行为。



4. ta可能有很多的性伴侣



一项跟踪600人近40年的研究发现，“恐惧依恋”可以预测个人一生中更多的性伴侣数量，以及更大的性依从性（sexual compliance，即遵从伴侣的性欲望）。对男女来说都是如此（Favez等，2019）。



因为ta们渴望爱，却害怕亲密，而偶然的性关系可以让ta们置于这种处境：



性活动既增加了亲密度，逃离可能导致抑郁的想法，也让ta们在感情上保持距离。







《心理学进展》上的一篇文章曾分析了电影《春潮》中祖孙三代形象，认为女儿郭建波是典型的“恐惧依恋风格”。



她对母亲纪明岚有深深的依恋，但在家中长期遭遇谩骂。面对压力，她选择“去激活策略”——郭建波来到情人的住处，短暂的露水情缘让她疲惫的身躯放松下来。在这里，郭建波以转移注意力的方式来逃避对母亲的依恋。



5. ta们更易出现攻击和控制行为



相对其他不安全的依恋类型，恐惧依恋的男性更容易对女性产生敌意、配偶虐待和儿童性虐待（Dutton，1994）。



6. 缺乏自尊，有强烈的拒绝恐惧



从性别维度看，女性比男性更容易产生恐惧依恋（Levy等，1998）。在女性样本中，恐惧依恋者具有“低自尊、沮丧和强烈的注意力需要”。



她们的共同点是，对他人有深深的不信任，不愿意寻求专业帮助。这可能与她们负面的自我看法和强烈的拒绝恐惧有关（Yaben，2010）。



是什么造就了一个恐惧型依恋者？



在Ainsworth等人（1978年）对婴儿所做的著名“陌生情境（Strange Situation）实验”中：



当一名安全型婴儿的母亲离开房间时，孩子会变得非常不安。她一回来，孩子就立刻跑到她身边寻求安慰和关爱。得到宽慰后，孩子会恢复玩耍。



一些婴儿属于回避型。ta们与父母分离时不会哭，不与父母寻求亲近，只是专注地玩玩具；一些婴儿属于矛盾型。ta们对分离非常敏感，即使与父母重聚也无法平静，拒绝接受安慰。







二十年后，Main（1991）等人重新研究这些录像，并分离出了一种“混乱型婴儿（disorganized）”。



这些婴儿的行为则相对奇怪。



比如，ta们可能想呆在父母身边，但避免目光接触；当母亲离开，ta们可能会无休止地尖叫，似乎想吸引大人注意；



ta们有时会表现出相互冲突的行为。比如当母亲回来，“一个孩子张开双臂好像在迎接，但突然又转身僵住、退缩，在房间里漫无目的地游荡”。







后来世界各地的研究者发现，婴儿期的混乱依恋，几乎就是成年人“恐惧依恋”的儿童版，预测准确率在68%~75%之间（Fonagy等，2002）。



对于这些混乱的孩子的研究发现：



1. ta的父母常表现出前后矛盾的行为，这让孩子不能信任ta是“可靠的”



这些婴儿往往经历了不太敏感的照顾（Main&Hesse，1990）。ta寻求与父母的亲近，却遭遇不安全的对待。有时依恋者甚至会表现得咄咄逼人，让孩子觉得“吓人”。



比如，父母因为孩子的某个行为微笑，奖励孩子，但有时会因完全相同的行为惩罚ta，剥夺ta基本的需求。



心理学博士Hal Shorey认为，恐惧依恋的成人，一般在童年时期有过至少一名养育者出现过“可怕的养育行为”。



这会在孩子体内产生一种对自身安全的恐惧——孩子下意识地觉察到，照顾者不能满足自己的需要。







2. 做出“让人恐惧行为”的家长，常常也有情绪问题



混乱型孩子的父母通常都有自己童年时期未解决的创伤。这些父母可能有抑郁、忽视、虐待或酗酒的倾向。与酗酒父母一起长大的小孩，产生恐惧依恋的可能性是不酗酒父母的四倍（Brennan等，1991年）。



然而，父母并不一定具备主观敌意。有精神疾病的家长也同样会让孩子感到害怕——因为孩子知道父母没有能力保护自己。



从神经生物学观点看，一些具有恐惧依恋对象的儿童，甚至可能无法全面发展出整合性的神经结构，导致成年后的情绪失调问题。



换句话说，孩子生来依恋父母，却不能将依恋者视为“安全基地”。在以后的生活中，ta们会创造出一个想要亲密的人，但同时也会创造出一个害怕亲密的人。







如何重建依恋关系中的安全感？



虽然恐惧型依恋听起来很不健康，但这种防御模式被发展起来，一定是因为它曾经保护过自己不受伤害。是面对压力所做出的正常反应。



以及，依恋类型并不一定是一成不变的。如果你经历了重大丧失（例如父母去世），或者受到了其他精神创伤（如冷暴力、长期处于情感虐待关系），安全的依恋风格可能转变为“不安全（包括恐惧型）”。



依恋理论的提出者Bowlby认为，虽然早期的依恋模式影响深远，但在新的关系、安全的关系，或者一个更能自我觉察的个体中，依恋模式都有被“更新”的潜能。



给恐惧型依恋者的几个tips：



克服对安全感的恐惧，寻求一段安全的关系。



比如谈恋爱，大约50%的成年人拥有安全型依恋模式，几率其实还不错。在新的关系中，你可以挑战自己的防御能力，并努力在这种关系中发展自己。



或者去见心理咨询师。心理咨询师会成为关系中的“安全基地”，与来访者重新建立一种新的、可靠的、具有接纳性的依恋关系，整合创伤，促进个人资源的整合。







从情绪上而言，觉察性冥想有可能为恐惧型依恋者提供暴风雨中的避风港（Linehan，1993）。



即：对想法、感受和身体感觉进行观察和做出标识的觉察性练习（而不是回避）。恐惧依恋者常常非常无法应对自己的情绪，这些技巧可能是非常有用的。



为自己的经历写一个连贯的故事。



依恋研究表明，儿童依恋类型的最佳预测因素并不是“父母经历了何种创伤”，而是“父母如何理解、解决这些创伤”。



对于未解决的创伤，一个很关键的做法是为自己创建连贯叙述的过程。重新讲述自己的故事本身，就可以“增强”安全感和个人心理弹性。



最后，如果你身边存在一个恐惧型依恋者：



首先要意识到，自己没办法消除ta所有的痛苦。依恋模式中那些带来痛苦的部分，可能只是过往未解决的创伤所探出的脑袋。



如果你还想保持这段关系，可能还必须忍受一些“测试行为”——ta们可能会做出一些莫名其妙的事，来看你是否会拒绝或伤害自己，不要把这些行为看得过于“个人针对性”。毕竟，我们都是从“自己如何被对待”中学习亲密关系的。这是过去经历的东西所教给ta的道理。

传统依恋理论认为个体依恋心理和行为模式具有相对稳定性, 但无论在信息加工还是个体发展过程中, 个体依恋模式均表现出二重性, 即既具有相对稳定性, 又具有情境敏感性。个体在情境中所表现出的依恋模式是个体相对稳定的特质性依恋和情境特征相互作用的结果。依恋启动研究中特质性依恋特征与依恋启动效应之间的交互作用模式为理解依恋二重特征及其关系提供了窗口。依恋系统激活的两阶段模型为整合和解释这些相互作用模式提供了框架。未来研究应优化依恋二重特征关系研究中启动效应的操作检验, 考虑依恋焦虑和回避维度的交互作用, 关注高焦虑群体内的依恋差异, 以理析依恋二重特征之间的相互作用方式, 同时关注依恋策略影响依恋启动效应的时间进程, 探究依恋二重特征相互作用的机制。

Traditional attachment theory suggests that an individual’s attachment-related psychological and behavioral patterns are relatively stable. However, from information processes or life-span development perspective, attachment patterns have trait-state duality, i.e. attachment patterns are both relatively stable and context-sensitive. An individual’s attachment pattern in a particular context is the consequence of his or her trait attachment and contextual feature interactions. The interaction patterns between trait attachment and attachment priming effects provide a window to understand the duality of attachment and their relationships. And the two-stages model of attachment activation offers a framework for integrating and understanding these patterns. Future studies should optimize the manipulation check of attachment priming, meanwhile, take the interaction between attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety in consideration. More attention should be paid to the individual differences in the high attachment anxiety group which may clarify the patterns of interaction between trait and state attachment. Moreover, the time course of how attachment coping strategies impact the effects of attachment priming should be concerned, which could reveal the mechanism of the interactions between trait and state attachment.

基于生命早期经验形成的依恋心理和行为模式具有相对稳定性, 会对个体生命全程的人际关系、人格发展等产生深远影响是依恋理论的核心假设之一(Raby & Dozier, 2019)。但实证研究对这一观点提出了挑战, 纵向研究表明早期依恋模式与之后不同时期依恋模式的相关性较低(Fraley & Roisman, 2019)。同时, 社会认知研究发现个体依恋相关心理和行为会受当前情境影响, 暂时表现出不同于个体长期占主导地位的依恋模式的特征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016a, 2016b)。可见, 个体依恋心理和行为模式既有相对稳定性, 也有情境敏感性。换句话说, 情境中个体的依恋心理和行为特征处于稳定性和情境引致变化性的张力中, 如同路边的树, 没有风的时候指向其经年累月形成的固定方向, 风吹来, 树的朝向则会随风而变, 风一停止, 则又恢复到原来的朝向。

社会认知范式为研究情境对依恋的影响以及个体依恋特征与情境的交互作用提供了有效工具和新证据, 但个体依恋特征具有二重性的观点也见于传统依恋研究文献中。研究者遵循Bowlby (1969/1982)以及Ainsworth, Bell和Stayton (1972)强调依恋个体差异的传统, 将个体依恋特征视为一种具有跨时空、跨情境稳定性的特质。受此研究思路的影响, 依恋类型的划分、稳定性及早期依恋经验对个体之后各领域发展的影响等问题一直是依恋研究的焦点。但Bowlby (1969/1982, 1973)在论述依恋特征具有相对稳定性的同时, 也强调个体依恋系统具有情境敏感性, 即个体依恋系统受情境因素的影响而被激活或终止激活。但由于研究方法的限制, 直至最近20年, 依恋稳定性与情境敏感性问题才得到系统研究。研究者借鉴社会认知领域的相关理论和研究范式, 开始关注依恋个体差异背后的认知加工过程, 证实了个体依恋相关心理和行为特征会因情境作用表现出不同于个体长期依恋模式的状态性特征(Fraley, 2007; Gillath, Hart, Noftle, & Stockdale, 2009)。同时, 个体较稳定的依恋特征与依恋相关情境特征共同决定了个体在某一依恋情境中最终的心理和行为表现(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016a)。

个体心理和行为模式的稳定性和变化性问题始终是人格、自我领域关注的重要问题(Conway, Singer, & Tagini, 2004)。理解个体依恋特征既具有相对稳定性又具有情境敏感性, 以及个体稳定性依恋特征如何与情境交互作用共同影响个体在某一具体情境中的依恋表现, 有助于加深人们对个体如何应对情境中依恋刺激的理解, 以及对依恋行为在进化中适应意义的认识。本文首先将讨论个体依恋二重特征的定义及其在信息加工和个体发展中的表现, 继而梳理依恋启动研究中特质性依恋与依恋启动效应的交互作用模式, 最后以依恋系统激活两阶段模型对这些交互作用模式进行整合和解释, 以期助益于将来相关研究的开展。

依恋特征是由与依恋相关的知识、情绪、认知加工和行为等构成的集群(constellation)或模式(Fraley & Roisman, 2019)。学者分别使用“特质性依恋(trait attachment)”和“状态性依恋(state attachment)” 描述个体在依恋相关情境中表现出来的相对稳定的心理和行为特征和因情境刺激变化而暂时表现出的不同于个体稳定特征的暂时性特征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2017)。潜在状态-特质理论认为, 个体的心理和行为取决于个体特征, 情境特征和个体与情境的交互作用。同时, 个体在具体情境中的心理和行为特征会随情境变化而变化, 从这个意义上讲, 个体在某一情境中表现出的心理和行为特征均是状态性的(Steyer, Schmitt, & Eid, 1999)。按该理论, 个体在具体情境中表现出的依恋特征均是状态性依恋, 且状态性依恋特征是由个体特质性依恋特征、情境特征以及两者的交互作用决定的。以下将在“个体-情境”框架下, 从信息加工的视角对特质性依恋和状态性依恋进行界定和说明。

特质性依恋是个体依恋特征中具有相对稳定性和跨时空一致性的特征, 它反映了个体较长时间内依恋特征的平均水平。个体会在长期依恋互动经验中形成相对稳定的依恋表征和图式, 其中占主导地位的依恋图式会影响个体在某一情境中的依恋心理和行为。特质性依恋有助于个体避免陷于无序和混乱中, 对保持自我同一性和连续性十分重要, 同时该类特征有助于人们对依恋相关心理和行为进行解释和预测。在传统依恋研究中, 研究者多使用依恋类型对个体依恋行为特征进行描述和组织, 如陌生情景测验、Q分类法、故事完成测验、成人依恋访谈、当前关系访谈 (Ainsworth et al., 1972; Ainsworth, Bell, & Stayton, 1971; Bretherton, Ridgeway, & Cassidy, 1990; Crowell & Owens, 1996; Hazan & Shaver, 1987; Waters & Deane, 1985), 研究发现使用依恋维度描述个体依恋特征可能比采用依恋类型更具优势(Fraley, Hundson, Heffernan, & Segal, 2015), 常用测量依恋维度的工具包括亲密关系经历问卷和父母与同伴依恋问卷等(Armsden & Greenberg, 1987; Brennan, Clark, & Shaver, 1998)。但无论类型法还是维度法, 均假设个体存在稳定的依恋模式, 依恋模式作为一种特质具有跨时间和跨情境一致性, 且存在个体差异。个体依恋类型或依恋维度旨在捕捉个体在较长时间内、在不同情境下均会表现出的依恋特征。

状态性依恋是个体特质性依恋与其所处具体情境共同作用所表现出来的心理和行为特征。个体所处情境既包括外源性特征, 如情境中危险线索, 依恋对象的声音或照片等, 也包括内源性特征, 如个体回忆和心境等。因情境特征的复杂、多变, 状态性依恋常表现出不同于特质性依恋的特征。状态性依恋意味着个体嵌套于当前情境中, 个体的依恋反应是灵活且可修正的, 该类特征有助于个体适应当前环境。尽管Bowlby (1969/1982)提出依恋系统具有情境敏感性, 个体依恋特征并非静态、不变的, 但后来研究者仅将情境特征变化作为捕获个体特质性依恋的工具和方法, 如在陌生情境测验中, 研究者通过操纵情境(母婴分离和团聚)引发婴幼儿的依恋行为, 以对母婴依恋关系进行分类(Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978)。随着依恋研究中认知转向的出现, 研究者开始借鉴认知心理学的实验范式, 特别是启动范式, 对情境线索如何影响依恋相关心理和行为进行研究(Bryant & Bali, 2018; Gillath & Karantzas, 2018; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2017)。在依恋启动研究中, 研究者通过操纵刺激材料改变个体所处情境的特征, 探究个体特质性依恋与情境的交互作用。在依恋启动范式中, 启动效应是状态性依恋的表现或其发挥作用的结果, 研究者通过依恋启动效应可以深入了解状态性依恋。

传统社会和人格研究中, 常以“时间”作为特质性和状态性心理和行为划分的标准, 如Gillath等(2009)开发的成人状态依恋问卷(State Adult Attachment Measure, SAAM)即将依恋行为特征的持续时间作为区分特质性依恋和状态性依恋的标准。而本文对特质性依恋和状态性依恋的界定是从信息加工过程的角度进行的。特质性依恋反映了个体长期依恋特征的平均水平, 而状态性依恋因为情境的复杂、变化性, 常表现为对特质性依恋的暂时偏离。

依恋特征的二重性与信息加工中自上而下和自下而上两类加工过程密切相关。从信息加工的视角看, 个体在依恋相关任务中的表现, 既包含自上而下依恋表征驱动的加工过程, 也包括自下而上情境线索驱动的加工过程(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016b), 两者共同决定了个体最终表现出的心理和行为特征。个体生而具有的依恋系统会对当前依恋相关物理和心理线索和依恋对象可用性(availability)进行评估, 并结合内部工作模式设定个体当前依恋目标 (Bretherton, 1985)。依恋目标驱使个体在需要时向重要他人寻求亲密, 以减轻痛苦并保护自己免受威胁(Bowlby, 1969/1982, 1973)。个体最终表现出的依恋特征是由个体内部工作模式和当前情境特征共同决定的(Fraley, 2007; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016a)。个体内部工作模式具有相对稳定性, 但其所处的情境(如是否存在危险, 依恋对象是否在身边等)则是时刻变化的, 这决定了个体依恋在不同情境下既会表现出某些共同特征, 也会表现出情境特异性特征。

应注意, 尽管状态性依恋和纵向研究中的依恋可变性都强调“变化”, 但两者不可混为一谈。前者所强调的变化是指在某一具体情境中依恋特征的暂时性改变; 而后者则是指特质性依恋在较长时期内是可以变化的。从个体发展历程的角度看, 在一段时间内个体依恋模式具有相对稳定性, 而个体发展, 生活环境变化、新的依恋关系形成等均会在一定程度上改变个体原有的依恋模式(Feeney, 2016; Fraley, 2007)。这与Piaget (1954)提出的同化和顺应观点一致, 个体在与环境的交互中, 通过同化过程, 个体依恋模式得以保持相对稳定, 而通过顺应过程, 个体依恋模式又会发生变化, 同化和顺应过程交互作用塑造了个体的依恋模式。尽管传统依恋理论认为在发展过程中个体依恋模式具有相对稳定性(Fraley & Roisman, 2019), 但纵向研究发现儿童养育环境与其成年后的依恋模式平均相关效应值约为0.15 (Fraley, Roisman, Booth-LaForce, Owen, & Holland, 2013; Chopik, Moors, & Edelstein, 2014)。再者, 发展时期也是影响依恋稳定性的因素之一, 依恋模式发展的社会化-选择不对称模型(socialization- selection asymmetries)认为儿童依恋模式会表现出更高的变化性, 而成人则表现出更高的稳定性。

总之, 在个体发展过程中特质性依恋是可变的, 而在较短时间内个体依恋既会表现出相对稳定的特征也会表现出情境特异性特征。个体依恋模式的二重性体现了依恋在人类进化过程中的适应意义, 即为适应不断变化的环境, 个体依恋相关心理和行为需取得稳定性和情境敏感性的动态平衡。

尽管Bowlby (1969/1982)在依恋理论建构时就提出, 个体依恋行为具有情境敏感性, 但受研究方法的限制, 传统研究工具大多旨在测量个体的特质性依恋, 如陌生情境测验、Q分类法和故事完成测验等(Ainsworth et al., 1978; Bretherton et al., 1990; Waters & Deane, 1985), 并不能对状态性依恋及两者之间的关系进行研究。随着启动范式在依恋领域的应用, 研究者可以在同一任务中同时考察特质性依恋和状态性依恋的关系 (Birnbaum, Hirschberger, & Goldenberg, 2011; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Hudson & Fraley, 2018; Mikulincer, Hirschberger, Nachmias, & Gillath, 2001; Stupica, Brett, Woodhouse, & Cassidy, 2018)。研究者通常用依恋维度(依恋焦虑和依恋回避)和依恋类型反映特质性依恋, 用依恋启动效应反映状态性依恋或状态性依恋的结果。依恋启动效应按启动刺激效价可分为安全启动效应和不安全启动效应(Gabriel, Kawakami, Bartak, Kang, & Mann, 2010; Granqvist, Mikulincer, Gewirtz, & Shaver, 2012)。需要注意的是在启动条件下, 状态性依恋与依恋启动效应并不相同。在依恋启动范式中, (外源性和内源性)启动刺激会引起个体依恋特征的状态性改变, 而依恋特征的状态性改变可能影响与依恋并非直接相关的认知加工和行为, 如创造性问题解决、团体认同和抑郁症状等(Carnelley, Bejinaru, Otway, Baldwin, & Rowe, 2018; Mikulincer, Shaver, & Rom, 2011; Rosenthal et al., 2012)。启动刺激作用下, 个体表现出的不同于特质性依恋的、与依恋直接相关的信息加工过程和行为特征才属于状态性依恋。这种改变及由其引起的其他与依恋并非直接相关认知和行为的变化均属于依恋启动效应。这些与依恋并非直接相关的认知和行为的改变在一定程度上也可以反映个体状态性依恋, 因此个体依恋维度得分或依恋类型与依恋启动效应的交互作用为认识个体特质性依恋和状态性依恋的关系提供了窗口。

安全依恋启动通过向被试呈现与依恋相关的刺激(如依恋对象的名字或照片), 激活依恋安全基地(secure base)相关心理表征进而影响个体后续心理和行为反应。安全依恋启动效应与依恋焦虑存在不同的交互作用模式。有研究表明低焦虑个体更容易受安全依恋启动影响, 而高焦虑个体则不易受此影响。安全启动后低焦虑个体对共情记忆的通达性更高(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001), 情绪感受更积极(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018), 而在这些研究中均未发现安全启动对高焦虑个体的显著影响。但也有研究发现了与之相反的模式。安全启动可以增强高焦虑个体对依恋相关词汇的通达性(Gokce & Harma, 2018), 减少对创伤记忆的回忆(Bryant & Foord, 2016), 降低对应激和消极情绪的易感性(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Schoemann, Gillath, & Sesko, 2012), 以及提高共情水平(Cassidy, Stern, Mikulincer, Martin, & Shaver, 2018)。同时, 在人际互动层面, 高焦虑个体在安全启动后更倾向于维持关系, 更少解除关系, 对社会联结强度和关系多重性的评分更高(Gillath, Karantzas, & Selcuk, 2017), 并更少使用自我责备(self-blame)分手策略(Collins & Gillath, 2012)。以上研究均未在低焦虑个体中发现安全启动效应。

与上述发现类似, 安全依恋启动效应与依恋回避间也存在不同的交互作用模式。有研究发现, 低回避个体更容易受安全依恋启动影响。在个体水平, 对于低回避个体, 安全启动会提高其共情记忆的通达性 (Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001), 减少创伤记忆闯入(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Bryant & Foord, 2016), 增强情绪体验的积极性并降低压力易感性(Bryant & Bali, 2018; Bryant & Chan, 2017; Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Schoemann et al., 2012)。在人际互动水平, 安全启动后, 低回避个体更倾向于寻求物质支持和精神支持(Gillath et al., 2006), 维持网络社交关系(Gillath et al., 2017)。但也有研究发现了相反的模式, 即高回避个体更容易受安全依恋启动效应影响。安全启动会降低高回避个体从遗憾中习得教训的感觉(Schoemann et al., 2012), 降低解除关系的倾向(Gillath et al., 2017), 降低其使用回避/退缩分手策略的倾向(Collins & Gillath, 2012), 并提高对他人需要的反应性(Mikulincer, Shaver, Sahdra, & Bar-On, 2013)。

此外, 安全依恋启动对依恋焦虑和依恋回避得分的影响也不同, 研究采用重复启动范式发现, 安全启动会降低个体焦虑维度得分, 而对回避维度得分无影响(Hudson & Fraley, 2018)。研究者还探究了依恋类型与安全依恋启动的交互作用。研究发现焦虑型个体更容易从安全启动中获益, 如安全启动后焦虑型个体对痛苦强度的评分更低(Pan, Zhang, Liu, Ran, & Teng, 2017), 更多向他人寻求安慰(Evraire, Ludmer, & Dozois, 2014), 而对其他不安全依恋类型个体甚至会产生消极影响, 如安全启动会提高恐惧型个体对痛苦强度的评分(Pan et al., 2017), 减少回避型个体向他人寻求安慰的倾向(Evraire et al., 2014)。此外, 其他因素也会调节两者间的交互作用, 如在非压力条件下, 安全启动可以提高恐惧型个体对抽象材料的喜爱程度, 而在威胁情境下, 则对其无显著影响(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001)。

不安全依恋启动可分为依恋威胁启动、依恋焦虑启动和依恋回避启动。威胁启动通过向被试呈现与依恋相关的威胁刺激(如分离相关图片、记忆等)影响个体依恋系统(Gabriel et al., 2010; Marks & Vicary, 2016; Rosenthal et al., 2012)。威胁刺激并未直接激活某一具体的依恋图式, 而是使依恋系统处于激活状态(Bretherton, 1985), 随后个体长期通达性最高的依恋表征或图式将被激活, 被激活图式或表征将驱动接下来的加工过程。依恋焦虑启动和回避启动则旨在激活与依恋焦虑和依恋回避相关的图式, 进而暂时改变个体当前依恋状态(Boag & Carnelley, 2016; Jarvinen & Paulus, 2017; Melen, Pepping, & O'Donovan, 2017)。

威胁启动效应与依恋焦虑和依恋回避之间均存在不同的交互作用模式。对于威胁启动效应与依恋焦虑的关系, 有研究发现, 威胁启动会影响低焦虑个体而不会影响高焦虑个体, 如威胁启动会降低低焦虑个体对浪漫性爱的渴望, 而对高焦虑个体的影响不显著(Birnbaum et al., 2011)。但也有研究发现, 威胁启动会影响高焦虑个体, 而对低焦虑个体则无影响, 如威胁启动会降低高焦虑个体对距离相关词汇的通达性(Marks & Vicary, 2016), 对抽象材料评分的积极程度(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001), 而在低焦虑个体中则无显著效应。对于威胁启动效应与依恋回避的关系, 有研究发现威胁启动会影响低回避个体而不会影响高回避个体, 如威胁启动会提高低回避个体对依恋对象名字的通达性(Mikulincer, Gillath, & Shaver, 2002), 而高回避个体则不然。也有研究发现了与之相反的模式, 威胁启动下男性回避水平越高其对伴侣照片的注意广度越大, 注意越不集中(Dewitte & Koster, 2014), 同时, 威胁启动会降低高回避女性的性欲望, 提高高回避男性的性欲望(Birnbaum et al., 2011), 而对低回避个体无影响。此外, 目标任务性质也会影响威胁启动与依恋回避之间的交互作用, 如个体对不同词汇的反应任务中, 威胁启动后回避水平越高个体对依恋对象相关词汇的通达性越低, 而对中性词和非词, 则不存在交互作用(Granqvist et al., 2012)。

除依恋维度外, 研究者还考察了威胁启动效应与依恋类型的交互作用, 但相关研究较少。研究发现在威胁启动条件下, 安全型个体反应更加开放和激进, 而不安全个体则更加保守, 如威胁启动后安全型个体更倾向于支持自由派候选人, 而不安全个体更倾向于支持保守派候选人(Weise et al., 2008)。此外, 目标任务性质和个体状态等会影响两者间的交互作用。对于目标任务性质, 在威胁启动条件下, 安全型、回避型和焦虑型个体对依恋相关词汇的通达性无差异; 而对于心理距离词汇, 焦虑型和安全型个体显著高于回避型个体。认知负荷也会影响两者的交互作用, 在低认知负荷条件下, 回避型个体对心理词汇的反应与安全型类似, 而在高认知负荷条件下, 回避型与焦虑型个体的反应均快于安全型个体(Mikulincer, Birnbaum, Woddis, & Nachmias, 2000)。

在不安全启动研究中, 对依恋焦虑启动与依恋回避启动与特质性依恋之间交互作用的研究相对较少, 但研究发现焦虑依恋启动与特质性依恋, 特别是与依恋焦虑存在交互作用。研究发现, 焦虑启动会提高低焦虑个体的进食量, 而对高焦虑个体无显著影响(Wilkinson, Rowe, & Heath, 2013)。再者, 依恋焦虑启动会降低高焦虑男性对亲密的渴望, 并使其在性幻想中的自我和他人表征更加消极(Birnbaum, Simpson, Weisberg, Barnea, & Assulin-Simhon, 2012)。值得注意的是, 有研究发现重复焦虑启动会降低高焦虑个体的焦虑水平(Hudson & Fraley, 2018)。这可能是因为该研究中焦虑启动采用了回忆叙事范式, 对消极关系的反思可能帮助焦虑个体修通其与亲密关系相关的负性信念和预期(Fredrickson, Cohn, Coffey, Pek, & Finkel, 2008)。此外, 焦虑启动可能会使回避型个体采用的抑制激活策略失效, 研究发现, 焦虑启动会提高高回避个体在共情情境下体验到的个人压力(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001), 这可能是因为回忆范式下要求回忆与亲密关系相关的消极记忆构成了额外威胁, 损害了其回避策略的使用(Mikulincer & Florian, 2001)。

尽管上述研究均稳健地表明, 特质性依恋与依恋启动引发的状态性依恋之间存在交互作用, 但也有许多研究表明无论在个体层面还是人际层面, 依恋二重特征的效应彼此独立, 即依恋启动效应独立于个体特质性依恋。在个体层面, 研究发现个体对威胁刺激的反应, 无论以心率、皮肤电活动还是以表情为指标, 安全依恋启动与依恋焦虑和回避维度均不存在交互作用(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Stupica et al., 2018), 且安全启动对反应抑制和挫折引起的情绪反应的影响也独立于依恋两维度(Karreman, Vingerhoets, & Bekker, 2019; Li et al., 2016)。同时, 安全依恋启动后, 个体在自传记忆回忆连贯性、具体性, 消极记忆闯入, 积极情绪通达性, 对挫折的情绪反应, 负性情绪管理中的表现均不受依恋维度的影响(Bryant & Bali, 2018; Bryant & Foord, 2016; Clear & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2017; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001)。而在人际互动层面也得到了一致结果, 关于浪漫嫉妒、网络攻击行为、偏见、人际应激、人格化策略、共情、帮助寻求和为他人提供帮助和支持等的研究均发现启动效应独立于个体特质性依恋(Bartz, Tchalova, & Fenerci, 2016; Gillath et al., 2006; Liu, Huo, Chen, & Song, 2018; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer et al., 2013; Pardess, Mikulincer, Dekel, & Shaver, 2014; Saleem et al., 2015; Selterman & Maier, 2013)。如对于他人需要的共情反应, 安全启动效应和特质性依恋分别独立挥发作用, 安全启动会增加个体在共情情境中自我报告的共情反应, 而依恋焦虑和回避会降低共情反应, 且两者之间不存在交互作用(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001)。

除安全启动的研究外, 不安全启动研究也发现特质性依恋与状态性依恋之间不存在交互作用。研究发现威胁启动会提高对依恋对象名字的通达性, 如母亲和离世的亲人, 且该效应独立于依恋焦虑和依恋回避(Carr & Landau, 2012; Mancini & Bonanno, 2012; Mikulincer et al., 2002)。再者, 压力启动会提高个体对亲近相关观念的通达性(Mikulincer et al., 2000)。此外, 关于个体对与上帝相关观念的认知开放性, 研究发现依恋焦虑启动、回避启动和安全启动与依恋回避和焦虑无交互作用(Jarvinen & Paulus, 2017)。可见, 无论安全依恋启动还是不安全依恋启动条件下均有研究发现依恋二重特征间不存在交互作用。

实证研究表明特质性依恋和依恋启动效应之间的关系模式十分复杂, 甚至存在方向相反的交互作用模式, 仅仅将这些不一致结果归因为误差显然并不合适。如何厘清这些复杂的结果, 并用同一理论框架进行解释, 有助于研究者对依恋二重特征的性质、功能及其之间的关系有更清晰、深入的认识。传统依恋理论主要包括两部分：(1)规范部分(normative aspect), 该部分主要是关于依恋系统及其发展的常态和普遍特征; (2)个体差异部分, 该部分主要是关于依恋系统运作的个体差异(Bowlby, 1969/1982)。与之对应, Mikulincer和Shaver (2016a)为解释情境刺激对个体依恋心理和行为的影响提出了依恋系统激活两阶段模型, 该模型为整合和解释上述复杂的交互作用模式提供了框架。

Mikulincer和Shaver (2016a)认为, 一旦个体评估发现情境中存在威胁, 依恋系统就会被自动激活, 该激活过程包括两个阶段。第一阶段, 威胁评估将导致依恋系统的潜意识激活, 并自动化地增强对依恋相关表征、想法和行为倾向的通达性。依恋系统激活的第一阶段与传统依恋理论中规范部分相对应, 该部分的核心观点是个体在感受到威胁时, 无论个体特质性依恋特征如何, 依恋系统均会被激活(Bowlby, 1969/1982)。不安全启动研究为该观点提供了证据, 研究发现在威胁启动或依恋焦虑和依恋回避启动条件下, 个体对依恋对象和亲近相关表征的通达性提高, 且该效应独立于依恋焦虑和回避维度得分(Carr & Landau, 2012; Jarvinen & Paulus, 2017)。既然依恋系统激活第一阶段的结果是激活依恋和亲密相关依恋表征, 提高其通达性, 那么直接激活这些依恋相关表征也应产生类似的效果。研究发现安全启动刺激会提高依恋相关表征的通达性 (Bryant & Bali, 2018), 抑制负性表征和负性情绪的激活, 提高情绪的积极性(Bryant & Foord, 2016; Clear & Zimmer- Gembeck, 2017)。这些被激活的积极表征和情绪将主导个体当前的心智状态, 使个体以更加积极、灵活和开放的方式应对威胁 (Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Stupica et al., 2018), 进行人际互动(Bartz et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Pardess et al., 2014; Saleem et al., 2015; Selterman & Maier, 2013)。无论是威胁刺激激活依恋系统, 提高亲密等依恋表征的通达性, 还是直接激活依恋安全相关表征, 两种方式均能对个体后续的心理和行为产生影响。尽管依恋理论的规范部分认为无论个体依恋特征如何, 个体在感知到威胁时依恋系统均会被自动激活, 但个体对情境刺激的评估可能受个体特质性依恋的影响, 所以Mikulicner和Shaver (2016a)认为该阶段依恋系统激活受过度激活和抑制激活依恋策略相关的兴奋性和抑制性环路影响。该观点也得到了实证研究的支持, 如威胁启动会提高低回避个体对依恋对象名字的通达性, 而对高回避个体无影响(Mikulincer et al., 2002), 还有研究发现, 威胁启动会降低高焦虑个体积极情绪激活, 而对低焦虑个体无影响(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001); 类似地, 研究发现安全启动可以提高低焦虑和低回避个体共情记忆的通达性, 而对高焦虑和高回避个体无影响(Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001)。

第二阶段, 依恋相关心理表征的潜意识激活可以塑造个体当前的心理状态, 甚至在个体意识到之前影响个体的行为计划(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016), 并且这些被激活表征将唤起有意识的、与亲密寻求相关的想法, 主导个体接下来的活动, 并在很多情况下转化为寻求亲密和保护的可见行为。在该阶段个体基于依恋经验形成的特质性依恋将发挥更大作用, 换句话说, 该阶段依恋个体差异将表现得更加明显。特质性依恋与依恋启动效应表现出不同交互作用模式可能与具有不同特质性依恋特征个体偏好的依恋表征和策略有关。依恋安全个体(低焦虑和低回避)通常采用安全基地策略, 并表现出积极的信息加工和人际互动, 而高焦虑和高回避个体则分别偏好过度激活策略和抑制激活策略, 表现出消极的信息加工和人际互动(Dykas & Cassidy, 2011)。

依恋焦虑反映了个体在需要时重要他人可得的程度以及害怕被拒绝和抛弃的程度(Moura- Ramos, Santos, & Canavaro, 2017)。高焦虑个体通常使用过度激活策略, 表现为长期对依恋信息保持高度警觉, 并伴随强烈的忧虑且努力、强迫性地获得依恋对象的爱和支持(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016b)。无论个体依恋焦虑水平如何, 安全启动均可提高个体依恋基地相关表征和情绪通达性(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Gokce & Harma, 2018; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001)。但高焦虑个体依恋表征通达性通常处于较高水平, 故低焦虑个体相对高焦虑个体更容易表现出安全启动效应。再者, 安全启动条件下个体安全基地相关表征激活水平提高, 高焦虑个体将体验到更强的依恋安全感, 进而使其之后的认知和行为表现更加积极(Bryant & Foord, 2016; Cassidy et al., 2018; Schoemann et al., 2012)。而低焦虑个体依恋安全水平相对较高, 安全启动对其影响更小, 所以在这种情况下高焦虑个体更容易出现安全依恋启动效应。研究发现安全启动在高焦虑个体中会产生两种不同结果：(1)安全启动能够给高焦虑个体带来积极效应, 使其无论在信息加工还是人际互动中的表现更加积极、具有适应性(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Cassidy et al., 2018; Gillath et al., 2017; Gokce & Harma, 2018); (2)安全启动并不影响高焦虑个体的表现(Bryant & Hutanamon, 2018; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer et al., 2011)。产生以上两种不同结果可能是因为焦虑型个体的依恋表征网络内既包括与依恋安全、亲密相关的积极表征, 也包括不安全依恋相关的消极表征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007)。因此, 若安全启动刺激激活积极表征, 则会产生安全启动效应, 若安全启动刺激让被试联想到消极经验, 激活消极表征, 则个体不会表现出安全启动效应, 甚至产生消极影响(Mallinckrodt et al., 2013)。在不安全依恋启动, 特别是威胁启动条件下, 高焦虑个体感受到更高的不安全感, 此时个体将采用防御性策略应对威胁, 进而使得之后的认知和行为更加消极, 如情绪体验更加消极(Mikulincer, Hirschberger et al., 2001)。而低焦虑个体安全水平较高, 能够更加积极地应对威胁(Rosenthal et al., 2012), 更少表现出不适应性行为(Birnbaum et al., 2011)。值得注意的是, Hudson和Fraley (2018)研究发现重复焦虑启动会降低高焦虑个体的焦虑水平。这可能是因为研究采用回忆叙事范式, 对消极关系的反思可能帮助焦虑个体修通其与亲密关系相关的负性信念和预期(Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991; Fredrickson et al., 2008)。由此可推断, 在阈上条件下依恋不安全启动的效应在很大程度上取决于个体对启动刺激的主观评估, 这与Mikulincer和Shaver (2016)的观点一致。

依恋回避反映了个体努力维持行为独立及与重要他人维持情绪距离的程度(Moura-Ramos et al., 2017), 高回避个体倾向于使用抑制激活策略, 通过抑制依恋系统激活避免可能产生的痛苦(Dykas & Cassidy, 2011; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016)。当安全启动效应体现为提高个体依恋相关的认知和行为表现时, 低回避个体更容易表现出安全启动效应。低回避个体依恋安全感较高, 在安全启动条件下能够以更开放、积极的方式应对威胁、进行信息加工和人际互动(Bryant & Chan, 2017; Bryant & Foord, 2016; Gillath et al., 2017; Gillath et al., 2006; Mikulincer, Gillath, et al., 2001; Mikulincer et al., 2011)。而高回避个体在面对威胁时, 通常采用抑制激活策略, 抑制对依恋相关刺激的通达性(Dewitte & Koster, 2014; Granqvist et al., 2012), 因此更不容易表现出安全启动效应。当安全启动效应体现为降低个体依恋相关消极行为时, 高回避更容易表现出安全启动效应(Collins & Gillath, 2012; Gillath et al., 2017; Mikulincer et al., 2013)。这可能是因为低回避个体通常能以积极的方式进行依恋相关的信息加工和人际互动, 消极行为相对较少, 因而更不容表现出安全启动效应。应注意, 高回避个体面对的“威胁”是经个体主观评价的结果, 即使客观刺激性质是安全的, 但若个体将其评价为威胁的, 也将驱使其采用抑制激活策略(Evraire et al., 2014)。但抑制激活策略并非在任何情境下均有效, 当该策略需要的认知资源被占用时就会失效, 研究表明该策略在低认知负荷下有效, 而在高认知负荷下则会失效(Mikulincer et al., 2000)。

综上, 安全启动效应主要体现在两个方面, 提高安全依恋个体依恋相关的适应性心理和行为表现, 降低不安全个体与依恋相关的消极认知和行为表现。而对于威胁启动, 依恋安全个体通常可以有效应对威胁刺激, 而高焦虑和高回避个体分别倾向于采用过度激活和抑制激活策略应对威胁。个体特质性依恋特征及启动刺激引起的状态性依恋特征共同影响了个体在具体情境中的表现。

个体在某一情境中表现出的依恋心理和行为是特质性依恋与情境引发状态性依恋相互作用、共同决定的。个体依恋模式处于稳定性与变化性之间张力的平衡中。依恋特征的二重性既保证了个体的同一性, 也使个体对环境的反应具有适应性。特质性依恋与依恋启动效应的多种交互作用模式为理解依恋二重性提供了实证证据, 依恋系统激活两阶段模型为理解、整合这些结果提供了框架。但在该领域仍然存在许多分歧和不足, 需要未来进一步研究。

当前采用依恋启动范式对于依恋二重性关系的研究存在的一个问题是大部分依恋启动研究未提供操作检验, 在这种情况下研究者更多通过结果事后推测依恋启动的有效性, 但并未提供直接证据证明依恋启动的有效性。这是因为操作检验可能引起被试对实验目的的猜测或降低本来就较弱的启动效应, 进而影响实验结果(Birnbaum et al., 2012)。Birnbaum等(2012)在研究中额外招募了一组被试只用于启动有效性的检验, 他们要求被试在启动完成后评价自己害怕被抛弃的程度, 结果表明焦虑启动组评分显著高于安全启动组。Schoemann等(2012)通过对被试在依恋想象启动任务中想象内容进行编码和分析确保被试进行了相应的想象, 但他们也未直接检验启动效应。Deng等(2016)通过实验组与控制组在完成启动任务后对当下感到安全、温暖、支持和想要给别人拥抱的程度的评分检验安全激活程度; 而Pan等(2017)通过启动前后的状态依恋问卷得分比较检验了启动效应。上述方法只可用于阈上依恋启动效应的操作检验, 不适用于阈下启动方法的检验。将来研究者应进一步优化阈上启动效应的检验方法, 同时发展适用于阈下启动效应的检验方法。

当前关于依恋二重性关系的研究多采用依恋焦虑和依恋回避两维度得分作为个体特质性依恋的指标。研究之所以多采用依恋维度描述个体特质性依恋是因其在某些方面更具优势(Fraley et al., 2015)。但当前依恋研究很多研究常分别对焦虑和回避进行单独分析, 而未考虑两者之间的交互作用(Gillath et al., 2015; Marks & Vicary, 2016; Mikulincer et al., 2014)。但有研究发现在依恋启动、依恋焦虑和依恋回避之间存在三者交互作用, 如Pan等(2017)发现对焦虑维度得分较高者, 若其回避维度得分高于一个标准差, 则安全依恋启动会降低其对痛苦图片的评分, 若其回避维度得分低于一个标准差则会提高其评分; 而低焦虑得分个体无论其回避维度得分如何, 均未发现启动效应。Schoemann等(2012)也发现了安全依恋启动与焦虑和回避间的三者交互作用, 安全启动可以降低高焦虑-低回避个体的遗憾感, 而对其他被试无显著影响; 同时安全依恋启动可以提高高焦虑-高回避个体通过错误学习的感觉, 而降低低焦虑-高回避个体通过错误学习的感觉, 并对其他类型的被试无显著影响。将来依恋启动研究中采用依恋维度测量个体特质性依恋时, 应考虑两维度间的交互作用。

目前研究中高焦虑与依恋启动效应存在不同的作用模式。有研究发现不安全启动会给高焦虑个体带来负面影响, 如降低情绪积极性和对同伴团体的认同等(Mikulincer, Hirschberger, et al., 2001; Rosenthal et al., 2012), 增加高焦虑个体的消极情绪体验(Mallinckrodt et al., 2013), 有研究

则表明高焦虑个体不受不安全启动的影响(Birnbaum et al., 2011), 甚至Hudson和Fraley (2018)发现重复焦虑启动会降低高焦虑个体的焦虑水平。这些不一致结果可能与焦虑型个体依恋表征的复杂性有关。焦虑个体的依恋表征可能是双效价的, 既有积极表征, 也有消极表征(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007)。激活不同表征可能会产生不同结果, 将来研究应关注焦虑个体依恋表征的双效价性, 采用更具针对性的启动材料, 进一步揭示高焦虑与依恋启动效应产生不同作用模式的原因。

根据依恋系统激活的两阶段模型, 从激活依恋系统的刺激呈现至个体做出反应存在两个过程(Mikulincer & Shaver, 2016)。第一阶段更多是自动化的, 而第二阶段个体特质性依恋将发挥更大作用。回避型个体倾向于采用抑制策略而焦虑型个体通常采用过度激活策略, 但这些依恋应对策略在信息加工中何时发挥作用仍不清晰。依恋策略是在个体对刺激进行评估时发挥作用, 还是在评估后做出反应时才发挥作用?未来研究应从信息加工时间进程角度对该问题进一步研究。此外, 依恋策略发挥作用是否需要意识参与也值得关注。研究发现阈下启动在创造性问题解决表现中, 启动效应独立于个体依恋特质性, 而在阈上启动条件下, 低焦虑个体表现出更高的创造性问题解决行为, 而对高焦虑个体无影响(Mikulincer et al., 2011), 这似乎说明个体意识参与是高焦虑个体的依恋策略发挥效用的条件, 这一问题也值得将来研究进一步关注。

【以下文章来源于鱼堂主爱思考 ，作者鱼堂主】

迷茫的原因有很多，大部分都是自己面对未来的不确定性不知道以后会过什么样的生活，但心里清楚自己恐惧什么样的未来。

你想努力可是你又不知道自己适合什么方向。

也可能你有自己喜欢的事，但又觉得没办法变成职业。

就这样你开始陷入对自己的怀疑，对未来充满无力感。在面对迷茫的压力时，每个人用不同的方式去应对焦虑。
最常见的方法是“逃避”。
有些人用打游戏来逃避现实，有些人靠刷剧来转移注意力。他们都希望通过这些行为让自己可以短暂地逃避那些需要面对的问题和选择。
虽然玩游戏和刷剧可以让人短暂地忘记迷茫，但每次游戏结束、电影看完后，你又会被一股更大的焦虑和无力感包围。你知道这样的状态对迷茫没有任何帮助，却又不得不一次次靠游戏影剧续命。迷茫在每个人生阶段都会遇到。之所以我们感到迷茫，说明我们开始对自己的生活进行思考，需要重新认识自己、了解自己、探索自己。
不是给你鼓劲，你就可以马上从焦虑迷茫中走出来。这些只能给你带来短期刺激，并不能真正地帮你解决问题，只是通过精神胜利法帮你看开点。
我建议你好好利用好迷茫期，把它当成重新认识自己的机会，学会跟自己相处，重新出发探索未来。
没有经历过迷茫、挣扎、思考做出的选择，都无法真正地指导你的人生。
这里有5个方法帮助你走出迷茫期。
NO.1 过好每一天无论是逃避还是忽视，都不是解决迷茫的好方法，最好的方法是坚定地过好每一天。把每天过好了，那种扎实的生活感觉就会给你带来力量。
给自己一点时间慢慢想，了解自己想要什么，明白自己真正想做什么，不要回避内心的声音。这个过程需要一点时间。其他方法都只能暂时压制。倘若有些问题想不通，迷茫就会一直跟着你走。
我们在迷茫时总会想一些还未发生、感觉很难解决的问题。这些问题都比较空泛，没有一个实在的事情承载。所以你想解决也无从下手。
比如说家里乱糟糟的。家里乱是一个实在的问题。你只要去整理。问题就会被解决。
但是迷茫没办法解决。比如，你担心未来生活不好，担心以后过得不幸福。这些问题没办法马上解决，自然就会让你感觉到无力。
迷茫会让人被巨大的焦虑感所包围。这些压力会打破你本来的生活节奏，而生活一旦变得不规律，就会让人对生活失去掌控感。这个感觉让你进一步觉得生活一团糟。
最好的方法不是幻想马上解决迷茫的问题，而是我们先踏踏实实地活好每一天，放下好高骛远的想法，把心沉下来，把手上的小事开始做好。
你可以尝试着跑跑步，在家做点健身项目，或者学习做饭等。这些看着不起眼、实际很有烟火气息的事情，最能抚慰一个人的内心。
在这个过程中，你会重新找到对生活的掌控感。一件件的小事会重新给你带来生活的希望。
更重要的一点是这些事情都是可以掌控的。对于一个迷茫的人来说，有一些每天可以掌控的事，能帮助自己重拾对生活的信心。
规律的生活、可以掌控的日常都可以减弱你的焦虑感。
NO.2 积累生活中的点点滴滴坚持一件小事，时间久了就可以变成一种心里寄托。
反正没人知道未来会怎么样，我们只能尽量为以后攒下积累、做好准备去面对未知。
可以是读书，可以是跑步，可以是摄影，什么事都可以。前提是要做能积累的事情。虽然这些事情我们短期可能看不到反馈，但你要清楚长期坚持下来，一定会给你带来好的结果。而我在迷茫的时候选择了读书和写作。
迷茫最核心的两个问题：
第一，不知该如何选择。
第二，不知道该怎么办。
这两个问题的本质可以看作是对世界的知之甚少。最好的方法当然是找一位经验丰富的老师，一点点带着你走出迷茫。
这对于普通人来说还是很难的。首先你不一定认识这样的人。其实就算你认识了，别人也很难花大量的时间在你身上。因为这个世界的本质就是交换。
这个时候读书可能是帮助自己、了解世界的最优途径。
面对迷茫我们依然不知该如何面对，如何去解决，但我们可以慢慢做出改变。为自己做事的踏实感也会影响你的心态。
这些看似不起眼的小事，最终会帮助你一点点走出迷茫，找到自己的目标。在迷茫的时候选择做一些长期才能看到结果的事，也可以让你的心态更加平稳。
NO.3 不必跟他人比较天下第一大蠢事，就是跟人比较。天下第一聪明事，就是跟人学习。
别人怎么样，那是他的事，无论好坏跟你没有关系。你可以羡慕别人，但不要陷入盲目的攀比。
其实羡慕也是一种动力。你希望自己过得更好，期待自己同样成功。
就怕你陷入攀比，总是接受不了自己比别人差。
经济学里有个理论叫“比较优势”。意思是每个人跟自己比，发现自己某个方面会更加有优势。
记住是跟自己比的优势，在你的能力范围内，做什么事达到的效果最好，你就去选择做什么事。至于别人在这件事上是否比你厉害并不重要。因为每个人都有自己的比较优势。虽然他比你厉害，但是他跟你竞争可能不划算，因为他有更大优势的工作可以做。
比如，你整理房间特别厉害。马云整理房间可能比你还厉害。虽然马云在整理房间上比你有优势，但并非是他自己的比较优势。他的比较优势是管理公司。不是他不能做整理房间的工作， 只是做这个对他来说收益太低了。
比较优势就是这样的道理，不是从心态上战胜对方，而是通过实实在在的推理得出结论。
NO.4 保持住精神面貌这是个很小的建议，但是对生活的帮助很大。行为真的可以影响心态，只要你自己不放弃，就有机会发生改变。
感觉特别焦虑迷茫的时候，感觉自己坐卧不安的时候，你可以打扫一下房间，做一点不用太多思考的事情，只要手上有实在的事情去做，心里就会产生安全感。
这个建议的核心是不能放任自己，人活着就是为了一口气。无论此刻的生活状况如何，我们都要把自己收拾干净，保持住精神面貌。这样就会改善懒散的个人状态。即使迷茫的时候，也应该以饱满的精神状态去面对生活。
环境可以改变一个人。这个道理大家都懂。因此在日常生活中，我们更加要保持良好的环境。
NO.5 迷茫是了解自己的机会无论是跟自己谈话，还是通过日记记录想法，都是了解自我的好机会。对自己越了解，对决策帮助越大。
对于我而言，写作就是跟自己的对话。我就是在一次次的写作中，逐渐找到方向，慢慢了解自己想做什么的。
如果你感觉迷茫，又不知道问题出在哪里，可以经常记录一下自己的情绪，经常复盘，也是逐渐了解自己的一个过程。
写作还有一个好处。那就是你一旦写出来，便可以用第三视角来看待问题。这样就不会过度地被自我的情绪困扰，你能通过一个更加冷静的视角重新审视自己的生活。
只有了解自己，才能明白自己想做什么。有了目标，你就走出了迷茫。
对于未来，谁都不知道会发生什么，不确定性一直会存在，但是我们已经跟自己达成一致，一起去探索未知的世界。
迷茫最好的解决方法，就是去面对它，而不是去逃避。
你寻找答案的过程，就是你度过一生的历程。
人生每一步都不会浪费，因为每一步都是你的人生。
如果此刻你也在处于迷茫阶段，希望你能有尝试面对迷茫焦虑的勇气。
直面自我，可能是迷茫带来的礼物。本文节选自《智识升级：让你的付出有回报》，欢迎阅读本书来了解如何真正做到“让努力看得见，付出有回报”！

# 工作时迷茫怎么办？这5个方法帮你解决_意义_思考_人生


                        由内容质量、互动评论、分享传播等多维度分值决定，勋章级别越高(
                        
                        )，代表其在平台内的综合表现越好。
                    

人类作为一种自认为拥有独立意志的高级动物，当找不到目标或者意义时就会迷茫，人类需要经常面对“迷茫”这种情绪。

生命本身就很神奇，一个人来到世界上，成长时会迷茫，处理人际关系会迷茫，工作中也会迷茫，面对生老病死更会迷茫。

当然对于现代人来说，最常见的就是工作时的迷茫，在这个复杂的世界上，每时每刻都有无数人在迷茫着。

迷茫是一种很合理很常见的现象，解决的办法有很多，这个过程需要自己去领悟。下面就给出几点建议，希望看到可以有所启发。



01停止过度思考

人的感受非常重要，迷茫很大程度上来讲是一种心理状态。有人说过：“当一个人开始思考的时候，烦恼就开始了”。从某种意义上来说，思考就是烦恼的根源。

在工作时感到迷茫，是不是因为你想得太多了呢？现在手里的工作还没做完，就想到了十年后二十年后甚至自己退休后的事情，现在的外部环境瞬息万变，谁也预测不准，你为什么要想那么远的事呢？

很多人没有过度思考的习惯，他们更关注当下自己的状态，比如下一顿饭怎么吃得更健康，如何才能把今天过好，这样的人都是很失败的人吗？我看未必吧。活在当下，停止思考，专心工作，就不会感到迷茫！



你可以调整自己的心理状态，每天只关心眼前的事，关心现在手里的工作是什么，如何把它干好，关心下一顿饭吃什么，明天早上起来穿什么衣服。

尽量只想眼前的事，别想那么多，或许你会发现幸福感提高了呢。所以，停止过度思考，你的迷茫也会少很多。

02制定计划和目标

如果你本身就是一个焦虑感很强的人，无法停止过度思考，那么你恰恰可以利用这一点，给自己设计一个计划、制定一个目标。

这个目标应该是那种非常远大，但是可以分为一个个小的阶段，并且可以一一实现的那种，这样你的工作就再次有意义了。

这就好比上学期间，面对枯燥乏味的学习，高考就是很多人的远大目标，他们的终极目标就是高考取得好成绩。正是在这种目标的激励下，很多无意义的学习内容变得有意义了。



按理说未成年人是最容易感觉到迷茫的群体，的因为他们承受的压力最小，还在人生的摸索阶段，但是一场场的考试，一节节课充斥了他们的整个少年时期，最终将他们送入社会，其中的道理懂得都懂。

所以现在你加入工作后，如果真的害怕迷茫，找不到意义，可能迷茫本身就是这种教育方式的结果，但是你还是可以从曾经的方法中寻找方案。

自己给自己设置一个“教学计划”吧，重新做回学生，完成一场场“考试”，你就不会再迷茫了，说不定还会因此而取得成功哦！

03在工作之外找到解决办法

不管出于什么原因，如果你必须要去做一份让你自己迷茫的工作，那就把这个前提条件当成一个既定事实，承受这个事实，然后自己调整心理状态，接受这份工作的无意义性。

有句话说过：“人不是生下来就必须工作的，人是逼不得已才去工作的”。

或许为了养家糊口，或许为了别人的认同，但无论如何，如果你想在无意义的工作中坚持住，那就应该在工作之外的时间寻求人生的意义，以此来减少自己迷茫的感受。



一天有24小时，除了工作和通勤还有睡觉的时间，至少还能剩下6-4个小时属于自己，那就从这6-4个小时之中寻求意义吧，健身、跑步、阅读、娱乐、培养兴趣，丰富自己，把这段时间作为自己的可以自由支配的时间，在这段时间寻求人生意义，其他时间用来维持自己的生存。

人对时间的感受是会随着心情变化而变化的，如果你真的找到了自己喜欢并且愿意为之付出的事情，4小时的的收获会比上班8个小时还要大，这样就可以维持自己的健康心态，不再迷茫了。

04做出改变

上面的三种说法都是让你自己与工作妥协，调整自己去适应工作，但是解决问题的方法不只有这些，你还可以改变自己，自己做出选择。

比如说你要是真觉得这个工作迷茫，那就离职，然后去做你想做的事，去干你想干的工作，或者干脆就不去工作，先去寻找人生的意义，等你不迷茫了再回归职场。

总之，你应该找出自己迷茫的根本原因，然后去解决！如果需要心理治疗就去治疗，需要换工作就去换工作，需要离开你的城市就要离开，不要犹豫，做出改变，做出行动！

这个行动不是明年，也不是一段时间后，不要觉得自己没有准备好，做出这种改变之前永远不会感觉已经彻底准备好了。

如果选择了那就是现在，否则你永远不会去行动，但是只有行动了才能从根本上解决问题。不要等到将来无法选择了，再后悔当初没有做出选择。

当然自己做出的选择后果不管好坏都要自己承担，做出了选择后可能你会明白自己想要的究竟什么。



总而言之，人生的终极意义是一个永恒的值得讨论的话题，其中工作的意义也需要咱们自己去寻找，去体会。人生就像一场旅行，工作只是其中的一部分，无论做出什么选择都应该坦然面对，相信你可以找到答案的。返回搜狐，查看更多

# 迷茫无处不在，困惑一直伴随，我们该怎么办？_澎湃号·湃客_澎湃新闻-The Paper

登录

焦虑、困惑和迷茫是我们一生中经常会遇到的问题，我们该怎么办？

“我不确定我的职业生涯。我不知道我对什么充满热情。

“我应该在工作两年后还是马上考硕士？”

“我应该攻读理学硕士还是建筑学硕士？我应该进入哪所大学？

“他喜欢我，还是只是在我的脑海里？我该不该去参加聚会？

这些是我们大部分时间都在脑海中的一些典型想法。当我们遇到时，了解为什么会发生这些困惑，并在我感到困惑时找到该怎么做的答案。

1.坦然接受和面对现实

逃避在任何情况都不可能是一个解决方案，它可能只是一个暂时的答案。但是，从长远来看，这对你没有好处。忽视这种情况会使情况变得更糟。就像止痛药可以在一段时间内减轻疼痛，但不能治愈伤口一样。

当你需要解决任何令人困惑的情况时，第一步就是接受它。我们只是习惯于逃跑，逃避，而不是思考。你可以接受它，而不是逃避。这样，你就可以清楚地了解你现在和以后面临的困惑的生活状况，这将引导你找到解决方案。

2.尽量不要恐慌

当我们试图逃避或找不到解决方案时，人类往往会感到恐慌或焦虑。所以，不要惊慌。想想看，你只是对生活感到困惑，但并没有迷失。试着增强自己，告诉自己你可以面对这一点。想想你认为自己曾经无法处理的情况，但你成功地做到了。

人们经常做出错误的决定。恐慌和焦虑通常会导致消极的想法和消极的结论，这种情况通常发生在我们开始感到害怕或产生一些恐惧时，所以不要让自己走向消极。

3.学会深呼吸

深呼吸有时会很神奇，它不会给你解决方案，但可以放松你困惑的头脑。如果你感到焦虑，无法做出任何决定或找不到方法，那就停下来深呼吸。

停下来，给自己一些时间放松一下。看看周围的环境，或者闭上眼睛，无论什么能让你放松。坐一会儿，告诉自己你可以做到，到目前为止你做得很好。

尽管如此，如果你最喜欢的活动，如绘画、唱歌或写作，并不能帮助你克服困惑的生活状况。然后，让你脑海中出现的任何想法都去思考，分析它们。但是，不要强迫自己在那个低迷的时刻做一些你不感兴趣的事情。

4.找出这种困惑的生活状况的利弊

你现在的生活处境可能很混乱，但是，无论如何，做出一个随机的决定并不是一个好主意。寻找光明的一面，当事情出错时，更愿意保持积极的态度。看，解决这个问题的可能性是什么？分析一下，你有没有办法从这种混乱的情况中受益？做一个笔记，写下这种情况的所有利弊，你可以推测。

找出并写下这种令人困惑的生活状况的利弊，思考未来的各个方面以及你能看到的所有可能性。你的决定会如何影响你的生活，是什么让你停下脚步。一切对你来说可能是好的，也可能是坏的。当你写下所有这些东西时，它会让你对情况非常清楚，并可以帮助你找到许多可能的方法。

5.与他人交流和分享

当你被困惑困住的时候，看不到任何可能的解决方案或希望时，你肯定会感到焦虑或消极。即使是一个充满困惑的特定场景也不会让你思考得更远。这样的事情可能会限制其他各种可能性或良好的解决方案。所以，和你的朋友和家人谈谈这个场景。与他们讨论，寻求帮助来解决这个令人困惑的人生阶段。

你可能不愿意分享，但是还是建议，当你在生活中感到困惑时，试着与关心你的人分享并交谈。与他们交谈，与你觉得舒服的人交谈，与那些你信任的人交谈，他们了解你的性格和你所处的处境。

所以，你不需要对自己做太多解释，你可能在那里找不到解决方案。但你可能会找到一些可能的方法或一些好的建议，帮助你摆脱困惑的生活。

6.学习新技能

人们常说，“如果你停止了学习，你就停止了成长”。

也许这是真的，学习与年龄无关，无论你多大或属于哪个领域。所以永远不要阻止自己每天学习和成长。如果你对生活感到困惑，想转移自己的注意力，你可以随时学习和发展新的技能，这些技能可能会在未来对你有所帮助。

学习新技能可以是任何事情。如果你曾经想过要学一些东西，但没能学会，那么现在就是时候了。也许这项新技能可以让你放松，或者让你找到你想要的东西，它甚至可以让你在生活中获得一些重大的或不同的机会。

当你坐着思考过度时，这对你没有帮助，当你在生活中感到困惑，不知道该做什么，去哪里。相反，你可以开发一些新的东西，这可能会帮助你找到一种新的方式来看待这种情况，并找到可能帮助你重新开始生活的解决方案。

7.阅读书籍

书籍也可以成为你最好的朋友。尤其是在这个困惑的人生阶段，当你找不到任何更安全的方式时，读书可能是一个更好的选择。所以，阅读你喜欢的任何类型的书，而不是目前的情况或最让你兴奋的那本。拿出你以前读过的旧书，如果找不到，那就带上一些儿童漫画。抓住这个机会，重新度过你的童年。

考虑到你目前在生活中的困惑，有些书可以让你大开眼界，有些传记可以给你很大的力量或灵感，让你以新的想法或心态看待问题。一些哲学书籍，对你很有帮助，这些书充满了人类倾向和生活真理的许多方面。你可能会找到一个解决方案或方法来处理你现在面临的这种令人困惑的生活状况。

8.远离任何消极情绪

生活中的困惑大多来自于你无法控制或对你来说很有挑战性的情况。当你的想法和情绪都是消极的时，你很难在生活中做出正确的决定。因此，与这些负面来源断开联系是非常重要的。外部或内部的负面看法只会使事情变得比实际情况更困难和更令人困惑。

休息一下，放松一下。花点时间独处，出去散步，做一些你喜欢的事情，或者听音乐。不要想得太多，让自己从所有困扰你的事情中解脱出来。给它时间，你最终会找到更好的出路。简单地说，匆匆忙忙地寻找解决方案，无论如何都无济于事。

9.设定生活中的优先事项

当你有太多的事情要做，并且在生活中取得了一切成就时，总的来说，你最终会在生活中感到困惑。控制你的欲望，改变你的观点，检查你生活中重要的事情。仅仅因为感觉好或看起来好并不意味着你需要它。不要对自己抱有过高的期望。当然，你可以在生活中做任何事情，但你不能独自做任何事情。

所以，在生活中寻找你想要的东西。发现需求和欲望之间的差异。人生要有远大的目标，但首先要确定接下来要做的事情的优先级，不要一心多用。只有你让你的生活看起来很复杂，而不是其他人。找到你的激情，找到人生的目标。自己找一些你喜欢做的事情。你不能控制一切，最好不要试图控制。

10.不要只是想，去做点什么

我们很多时候面临的主要问题是，我们首先想到的是结果，而不是实际的结果。我们生活在我们想象的世界里。我们是设定目标的人，我们是限制我们的人。不要因为你的消极情绪或过去的事件而让自己停下脚步。你过去失败了，并不意味着你将来也会失败。

从你的想法或过去的遗憾中解脱出来。不要让消极的想法以任何方式控制你。采取行动，做点什么。仅仅通过思考，你永远无法在生活中取得成就，想的太多肯定会限制你自己。所以，不要过度思考和分析情况，自己尝试做点什么。

# 迷茫时的3个选择，决定了你人生的高度（深度好文）_乔布斯

你是不是曾经有一段时间，每天不知道该做什么，总觉得痛苦不堪？

你是不是每周有五天，都不想上班，从周一就觉得日子好黑暗，可是却不知该怎么办？

你有没有发现人到中年，周围人一个个都比你有钱，老婆天天抱怨，而你的事业，永远看不到明天？

嗯，我们把这种状态叫做“迷茫”。有句话说得好，谁的青春不迷茫？

别说青春了，就是中年人，也常常会陷入迷茫之中。

但是，有人在迷茫中迷失了自己；有人从迷茫中走出来，闯出一片新天地。

前一种叫普通人，后一种叫高人。普通人还在继续迷茫，而高人已经攀上人生巅峰，或者正走在通往巅峰的路上。

今天我们讲一讲从3个层次应对迷茫的方法。这3个层次的选择，将决定你人生的高度。

3个层次由易到难，可操作性很强，而且一定对你有用。不管你未来做什么，为此花的时间，都不会浪费。



作者：何加盐

来源： 何加盐（ID：ihejiayan）

01 第一层次：与迷茫为伍

培养好的习惯，重塑底层系统

一个人开始迷茫，往往是由无聊开始，然后慢慢陷入焦虑，接着变得恐慌，最后越来越痛苦。

如果你已经麻木了，那说明你已经迷茫太久，放弃了挣扎，就像那只在温水里的青蛙。

如果你想改变这种状况，那么，下面的内容会对你非常有价值。

当你决定要改变时，不要着急。别指望一下子就能赶走迷茫，那是第三层次的事情。现在，先专注于第一层次，做一些很容易的事。

请你从今天开始，做3件事情：

（1）把闹钟调早10分钟；

（2）睡前做10个俯卧撑（或仰卧起坐）；

（3）每天阅读10页书。

你只要做这三件事情就行了，不必做别的，也不必做更多。不必做很长时间，只要一个月就好。

大多数人在迷茫时，不是没有做出改变的努力，但他们失败了，最大的原因，就是“贪多”两个字。我们不要贪多，就这些就好。

我为什么要你做这三件事，而且只做这三件事呢？

因为， 这三件事，分别代表作息规律、坚持锻炼和持续学习。它们决定了你的时间管理有效性、身体健康程度以及进步的持续性。

早起10分钟，意味着你不用像打仗似的洗脸刷牙化妆吃早餐赶地铁，你完全可以从容很多，妆容化得更精致、早晨吃得更精细。而且提前5-10分钟到公司，比踩着点上班，给老板和同事的感觉完全不同。

每天10个俯卧撑，坚持下去，你的肌肉就会发生改变。而且，你能轻松完成任务，获得愉悦感，而不是制定100个俯卧撑的目标，结果完不成，每天觉得自己罪孽深重。

每天10页书，一个月刚好看完一本，你又获得了新的知识或者启发。而且，只读10页，不累，还可以精读。

请记住，不要太贪。我们做这三件事，不是为了它们本身能带来的多少好处，而是为了一个更重要的目的：

形成良好习惯！



如果第一个月你坚持下来了，就会获得成就感，而且觉得非常简单——因为确实很容易就能做到。

现在，你再尝试第二个月，可以稍微加一点码。例如，晚上提前12分钟放下手机；睡前做12个俯卧撑；每天看12页书。

第二个月坚持下来了，你可以再尝试第三个月，第四个月……

习惯的改变，不在烈度，而在于持续性。

不管多么脱胎换骨的改变，都可以从很小很小的，完全在自己能力范围之内的地方开始。

习惯，就是你身体与思维运行的底层系统。当你形成了一些好的习惯，一切都会慢慢改善。

这一层次的核心要点，就是要循序渐进，别给自己太大的压力，千万要避免那些宏伟的目标。只要小小的就好。



02 第二层次：与迷茫作战

从身体到思维，全方位提升技能

苹果公司创始人乔布斯，年轻时曾经很迷茫，不知道干什么，结果想了一圈，跑去学书法！ 

要知道，乔布斯的国家是美国，他们学的是英语，书法有个鬼用啊。

于是后面10年，这些知识除了能在写情书时凸显格调，其他时间都没啥用。

那么，乔布斯为了打败迷茫，花在练字上的时间浪费了吗？

并没有。

根据乔布斯若干年后在斯坦佛大学演讲时的回忆：“十年之后,当我们在设计第一台麦辛托什电脑的时候，它就回归到我身边。我把当时我学的那些家伙全都设计进了Mac。那是第一台使用了漂亮的印刷字体的电脑。”

实际上，如同乔布斯练书法一样， 有很多事情，现在看起来没用，但是以后肯定会对你有帮助的。

如果你很迷茫，不知道干什么好， 你至少可以先开始干一些绝对不会错的事情。

例如：

1.学一些以后工作用得上的技能：

演讲、写作、书法、PPT、外语、编程、心理学、经济学、财务管理、企业管理、时间管理、思维导图、广告设计、营销技巧、商务礼仪、着装规范、（女生）化妆……

2. 学一些生活用得上的技能：

烹饪、茶道、品酒知识、时尚穿搭、理财知识、营养搭配、养生保健……

3. 也可以学一些纯娱乐调剂性质的技能：

吉他、合唱、民乐、素描、插花、跳舞、陶艺、雕刻、剪纸……

4. 还可以学一些有益身体的技能：

羽毛球、网球、高尔夫、篮球、瑜伽、滑板、跑酷、游泳……

和第一层次的要求一样，不要贪多，先选择其中一两样开始学（1-4类别搭配，每一个类别只选一样）。

而且，要学，就沉下心来，学精、学细，争取学一门，会一门。不要狗熊掰棒子，捡起这个丢掉那个。

当你开始做这些事情时，迷茫看起来已经没那么痛苦了，甚至可能你都已经忘记迷茫这回事了。更重要的是，你的人生方向，或许就藏在这些技能里面。

当你发现你在学习上面某一方面技能时，特别开心，而且进步神速的时候，也许，那就是你未来应该从事的方向。或者你虽然喜欢，但是进步慢，也没关系，就当作一个业余爱好，一直做下去，调剂一下生活，也能让你幸福很多。

在第二层次，我们还需要用到一个 时间管理四象限法则。

不要被“四象限法则”这个名字吓到。其实很简单，就是把你要做的事情列一个清单，然后根据重要性和紧急性，按照四个区间分门别类。



第二层次的事情，主要都涉及到上图第二象限（左上角区域）：重要但不急的事情。

这些事情，对我们未来是非常重要的。但是，由于实在是太久远了，或者短期根本看不见效果，很容易就会被我们的健忘症杀死，或者被拖延症拖死。

按照时间管理法则，对于重要但不急的事情，应该制定明确的计划，按部就班地坚决执行，才能治得住健忘症和拖延症。

这个时候，我们第一层次训练出来的良好习惯，就要派上用场了。

利用你的好习惯，去尽心浇灌几个新技能，让你从身体到思维，从内到外，都焕然一新，准备好迎接更高的挑战。



03 第三层次：与迷茫再见

打破死循环，解决根本问题

第一层次和第二层次，可以让我们在面对迷茫时，知道怎么去应对，活得更好一点，但是不解决根本问题。

如果你不想清楚自己到底想要什么，以及该干什么，迷茫迟早还会来缠绕你。

那么，第三层次，我们来说说怎样根本性地解决迷茫问题。

迷茫的本质，是战略目标不明确，和战略路径缺失。换成人话就是：我要去哪？我怎么去？

第三层次，我们重点解决“我要去哪”这个问题。（“我怎么去”请参考一二层次）

这里，我提供由浅到深的三种办法，你可以综合运用。

人生道路选择方法一：标杆法。

顾名思义，标杆法，就是找一个人生标杆，或者说榜样，你去向他学习。

我们不知道该走什么路，往往有两个原因，一是不知道都有哪些路，二是不知道这些路上都有哪些风景和荆棘。

这时候，我们可以看看那些我们佩服的成功人士。他们都是怎么选择人生道路的？他们的路上究竟是什么状况？他们是怎么走的？

前面说到每天看10页书。 迷茫时，最需要读的书，是名人传记和企业家创业故事。

看名人传记的好处，就是可以看看世界上都有那些路，路上的风景如何，别人是怎么走的。

小米公司创始人雷军，当年正是因为看了《硅谷之火》，几天几夜激动得睡不着觉，立志一定要走上计算机和互联网这条道路。这一走，就是一辈子，越干越起劲，越干越成功。

请现在就到京东、淘宝、亚马逊、孔夫子旧书网，搜索“名人传记”，或者到离你最近的书店去买，选择那些你喜欢的人。如果不知道喜欢谁，就选名气大的人，如乔布斯、马云、雷军、稻盛和夫、巴菲特、马斯克等；或者名气大的公司，如《麦肯锡传奇》、《华为奋斗密码》、《腾讯电竞》等等。

不知道往哪走时，最好的办法：跟着牛人走。



人生道路选择方法二：三维度交叉法。

世界上的专业和职业虽多，但是值得我们选择的，只有三类：我喜欢的，我擅长的，能赚钱的。如果这三个标准都不符合，那你绝对不应该选择。

最好的选择，是三个都符合。如下图：



喜欢又赚钱多，但是你不擅长的，人家不会要你，得等你培养出“擅长”的实力才行。

喜欢又擅长的，可是不赚钱，你只能穷开心，可能连自己也养活不了。

擅长又赚钱多，可是你不喜欢的，你会越做越难受，渐渐开始怀疑人生，怀疑自己存在的价值和意义。

要三个维度都符合的，就更难了。那怎么办呢？

我的建议是六步走：

1. 先把所有的职业（专业）列一个清单；

2. 在里面选出你最喜欢的；

3. 扎进去好好学，让自己变得有点擅长；

4. 凭着“有点擅长”，找到一份这个领域的工作；

5. 继续不断练习，让自己变得很擅长，成为该领域的专家；

6. 凭着专家的实力，赚很多钱。

用这六步走的方法，从短期看，你可能会损失一些当下可以赚到的钱，或者会非常累（假如利用业余时间学习）。

但是从一辈子的角度来看，这样才是最合理的道路，也是最容易一直保持前进动力的道路。

所以，这不是一条适合每个人的路，它只适合能够承受得住短期损失、或者能够吃得起苦的人。

人生道路选择方法三：战略选择法。

有一个最常用的战略选择工具， 叫SWOT分析，也就是从公司或个人的优势、劣势，和外部的机遇、威胁，4个角度来分析问题。 

如果你想知道自己是否适合某一个行业/工作，请拿一张纸、一支笔，写上优势、劣势、机遇、威胁这位四个标题。

然后，分析你自己的情况，和你所在岗位/公司/行业的情况，在标题下面填上你的分析结果。

这个方法，也不一定适合所有人，因为它要求有一定的思维和分析能力。你需要能对自己的优势劣势有准确认知，对市场的机会和风险有较为系统的判断。思维和分析能力较强的朋友们，不妨试一试。

04 总 结

让我们对上面的内容做一个总结：

首先，我们要认识到，迷茫不是你一个人的问题，是社会普遍的问题。当你发现，大家都和你一样的毛病，是不是感觉好一点？

其次，应对迷茫，有三个层次的选择，由易到难分别是：

第一层次：与迷茫为伍。我们要从一些最简单的事情做起，培养良好习惯，重塑底层系统。

第二层次：与迷茫作战。我们可以做一些不管未来做什么，永远都有用、从而也绝对不会错的事情，让自己从身体到思维，全方位提升技能。

第三层次：与迷茫再见。我们要找到困扰自己的终极问题是什么，想明白自己未来的路到底要怎么，打破迷茫的死循环，一次性解决根本问题。

来源：何加盐（ID：ihejiayan）



推荐语：我们无法避免日常工作、生活和亲密关系中的麻烦和问题，以及巨大的悲痛和损失的发生，但是我们可以控制对待这些不顺之事的看法。掌握和运用“反消极”思维，能够促进我们的幸福和身心健康。

在这本书中，桑德森博士提出“反消极”的思维模式，向我们阐述了思维模式是如何对心理和身体健康产生重大影响的。最重要的是，这本书告诉我们无论遇到何种情况和困难，我们都可以掌握和运用积极的成长性思维模式，做出细微的调整来提高生活质量、身心健康水平，成就蓬勃丰盈的人生。返回搜狐，查看更多

# Reasons Behind Feeling Lost in Life and What to Do - Calmerry

Table of Contents

Ever felt stuck or that you’re drifting aimlessly in life and wondering, “I don’t know where my life is going?” Though not often talked about, feeling lost in life is a common occurrence that many people experience at one time or another.

This feeling can make you feel disconnected from the people around you and make you wonder about your purpose in life. These thoughts can lead to feeling confused, anxious, and/or depressed. 

But it’s definitely a normal part of life to feel lost and question your purpose.

Feeling lost in life is an intricate emotional condition. It can feel a lot like depression. Those caught in this whirlwind of uncertainty often grapple with a range of emotions, including sadness, anxiety, and frustration.

Feeling lost can also be accompanied by a sense of isolation, loneliness, and disconnection from those around you. 

Other symptoms of feeling lost might include:

At its core, feeling lost is often rooted in inner conflict. This feeling arises from having conflicting values, beliefs, or desires. Living out of alignment with your own principles and integrity only deepens this sense of disconnection.

There are many reasons for feeling lost in life. A major aspect of feeling lost is the lack of purpose or clear direction in life. This can manifest as uncertainty about the future and an absence of concrete goals or aspirations, leaving you feeling aimless and directionless. 

But it’s not only uncertainty about the future that can contribute to feeling lost in life. These feelings can arise from a variety of factors that vary among individuals.

Life is full of transitions. Major life transitions can challenge your identity and sense of belonging. Graduating from school, starting a new job, moving to a new city, or experiencing the loss of a loved one can upend one’s sense of normalcy and provoke feelings of being lost.

In these instances, you may not have an established routine, know your way around, or have friends yet. 

Having goals gives us something to strive towards and a purpose in life. Without personal goals or benchmarks for success, life can seem like an endless cycle without purpose. 

The absence of clear aspirations can leave a void that contributes to the feeling of being lost and directionless.

If you have a lot of important or life-changing decisions to make, the overwhelming choices can leave you feeling stuck. 

In a world where there are infinite paths to take, making a decisive choice about which direction to go in life can be daunting, leading to paralysis and being unsure of what to do.

Have you ever thought, “I don’t know who I am”? Not knowing oneself deeply – what one wants, values, or finds meaningful – can lead to disorientation and lack of direction. 

Without this self-understanding, it’s easy to feel unanchored. Personal identity crises, such as self-esteem struggles and gender or sexuality issues, can lead to this sense of not knowing oneself. 

A job or lifestyle that doesn’t align with your passions or values can lead to dissatisfaction, prompting questions about your purpose and direction. 

Burnout from chronic stress or overwork can also leave you questioning your life choices and feeling like you have no direction in life.

Unexpected events such as economic downturns, the loss of a loved one, or natural disasters can disrupt your life trajectory and leave you feeling shocked, angry, sad, and lost. 

Aspects of your life and identity may be intertwined with the person or place that may no longer be there or be the same. This may make you unsure of how to move forward.

So, there are many reasons for feeling lost in life. Both negative and positive transitions can upend our sense of self and leave us wondering what to do and where to go next. 

Sometimes, we think of the lack of direction or purpose in life as a midlife crisis. But this feeling can happen at any time in life. In fact, it’s a rather common experience that many people encounter at one point or another. 

As we mentioned previously, any life transition can contribute to this feeling of being lost in life and existential depression. 

Feeling lost is a natural response to change and can indicate personal growth.

Feeling lost in your 20s is not only normal but also quite prevalent. This decade of life is often thought of as a period of exploration, discovery, and excitement, but it’s also a time that’s full of uncertainty and the pressure to figure out one’s life path. 

Your 20s are typically marked by significant life transitions, such as graduating from college, starting a career, and forming long-term relationships.

[4]

Carlsson, J., Wängqvist, M., & Frisén, A. (2015). Identity development in the late twenties: A never ending story. Developmental Psychology, 51(3), 334–345. https://doi.org/10.1037/a0038745


Each of these milestones comes with its own set of challenges and can lead to feelings of being lost as you navigate new responsibilities and expectations.

There’s also societal pressure that by your 20s, you should have your life “together.” Meaning that you should know your career path, be in a serious relationship, and be on track for future success. But that is not often the case for many people. 

When reality doesn’t match these expectations, it can lead to a sense of disorientation and inadequacy.

Despite the belief that everyone should have it figured out by the time they graduate from college, the 20s are a critical time for identity formation.

[5]

Settersten, R. A., Ottusch, T. M., & Schneider, B. (2015). Becoming Adult: Meanings of Markers to Adulthood. Emerging Trends in the Social and Behavioral Sciences, 1–16. https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118900772.etrds0021


It’s a period where many question who they are and who they want to become. This introspection can lead to a deeper understanding of oneself, but it can also be a source of confusion and feeling like you have no direction in life.

Feeling lost in your 20s is a common experience that signifies the struggle of coming to terms with adult responsibilities while trying to maintain one’s sense of self and purpose. 

These feelings are normal and often temporary. They can be an important catalyst for personal development.

Feeling lost in your 30s is also a common and normal experience, though the reasons may differ somewhat from those in your 20s. By the time people reach their 30s, they often face a new set of challenges and life questions that can contribute to feelings of uncertainty or a sense of being adrift.

By the time you reach your 30s, you’ve likely made significant life decisions regarding your career, relationships, and lifestyle. It’s normal to start questioning these choices and whether they align with your true desires and values, which can lead to a sense of feeling lost or the need for change.

There’s also often an internal or societal pressure that by your 30s, you “should be” settled in a career, “should be” married, or “should be” starting a family. If your life doesn’t fit this narrative, it can prompt fears that you’re falling behind your peers.

Some people may find that the career trajectory they’ve been on is no longer fulfilling or that they’ve reached a plateau. The desire to shift careers can lead to uncertainty, particularly as such changes often come with financial and personal risks. 

Financial responsibilities often increase in your 30s, with mortgages, family expenses, and savings for the future becoming more prominent concerns. Thus, these risks can place further stress and strain on one’s life.

Friendships and social circles can change significantly during this decade, as many peers may focus on their family life or career. Those who don’t follow the same path might feel a loss of connection and a need to seek out new social groups, which can be disorienting and make you feel lost and alone.

The 30s are a time when the idealism of youth often meets the practical realities of adult life, sometimes leading to anxieties and confusion. Recognizing these feelings as normal can be the first step in navigating through them.

Feeling lost at this age can spur changes that lead to a more authentic and satisfying life.

Feeling lost in life and career can be disheartening. The thought, “I feel lost,” can make us feel anxious and fearful, but it also presents an opportunity for self-discovery and redirection. 

Here’s what you can do when you feel lost and confused:

Ignoring or denying our emotions can do more harm than good.

[6]

Webb, J., PhD. (2022, February 19). 3 Problems caused by ignoring your emotions. Psychology Today. https://www.psychologytoday.com/3-problems-caused-ignoring-your-emotions


The first step in how to stop feeling lost in life is to accept that it’s okay to feel this way. 

You’re not alone in feeling lost, and it doesn’t mean you’ve failed. Acknowledge your emotions without judgment.

Give yourself permission to take a break from trying to figure everything out. Sometimes, stepping back can provide a fresh perspective.

Take time to consider what really matters to you. What are your core values? What activities make you lose track of time? 

Rediscovering what you are passionate about can help you find direction.

When you’re feeling overwhelmed, setting small goals can help you take steps towards larger aspirations. Completing these can build confidence and a sense of progression.

A counselor or therapist can provide professional guidance. They can help you clarify your thoughts and formulate a plan of action. 

Professional support can help you explore your feelings and teach you tools to be able to manage how you’re feeling. 

For those lacking access to in-person mental health professionals, online therapy on Calmerry can be a great option.

Often, when we feel lost, we neglect our well-being. Ensure you’re getting enough sleep, eating well, exercising, and finding time for relaxation. Engaging in practices like meditation can help you relax and focus better. 

Focus on the aspects of your life that you are thankful for. Gratitude can shift your mindset from what is lacking to what is abundant.

Journaling can be a powerful tool for self-discovery.

Write about your experiences, feelings, and what you’re learning about yourself. Journaling can help you process your thoughts and emotions in a safe space. It can also help you prioritize your concerns and fears. 

Feeling lost is often a temporary state. It’s a sign that you’re questioning, growing, and evolving as a person. With each step, no matter how small, you’re carving out a path that is uniquely yours.

# Feeling Lost: 9 Ways to Cope When You Feel Lost

Feeling lost in life is one of the worst feelings in the world. It’s something that a person will likely experience at some point in their lives. Feeling lost can be caused by several factors, such as a lack of purpose, fulfillment, or direction. Right now, it may seem like life has no meaning. When this happens, though, remember that you need to go easy on yourself instead of blaming yourself for feeling lost. Fortunately, there are still ways you can cope with this challenging situation. In this article, we’ll be sharing some techniques to help you cope with feeling lost.

When you feel lost, you don’t know what to do, how to feel, and which direction to lead yourself. When feeling lost, we tend to question every aspect of our lives, spiraling us out of control. People who feel lost often take one small setback or problem and extend it to other areas. This process is known as catastrophizing. That’s why what starts as a minor problem grows big quickly.

You might begin to lack provision, direction, and purpose. You may even start second-guessing yourself and the things in which you’ve believed. This feeling eventually trickles down to countless areas, such as friendships, relationships, career paths, and personal growth.

Feeling overwhelmed with difficult situations can sometimes cause a sense of feeling lost. One of the most dangerous aspects of feeling lost is when you no longer recognize who you are, which affects your self-image and confidence. This feeling often creates a sense of detachment since you no longer identify with yourself. However, feeling lost is also sometimes necessary since we tend to run away from our painful emotions, complicated relationships, past trauma, and other challenging events. When you feel lost, it can raise an alarm bell that it’s time to pay attention to the truth you’re running away from and make necessary changes in your life.

No matter how difficult the feeling of being lost might seem, realize that it’s not a feeling that will last forever. All suffering in life is temporary. There’s no exception. The more you try to avoid this feeling, the more you likely won’t be able to cope with it. An inability to cope happens because we often tend to extrapolate it, understand it, and, thus, magnify it as a result. People who try to figure out what’s causing the issue instead of letting the feeling be often make the situation worse themselves. Overanalyzing a fleeting feeling often makes the feeling last longer. It’s essential to recognize that sometimes you’re going to feel negative emotions. Instead of dwelling on them, allow yourself to experience the sentiment since it isn’t lasting anyways.

There’s nothing wrong with feeling lost, no matter how difficult it is to sit with your feelings. It would help if you also realized that sometimes feeling lost is the key to making necessary changes in your life to becoming better. You can always use this feeling to your advantage and reflect on your life. Everyone feels lost at some point in their lives, but it’s up to you how you’re going to cope with that feeling.

You have control over your emotions and thoughts – not the other way around. You create your current reality, and you shape your life. Nobody else but you is in charge of how your life turns out, which means you will always have the upper hand. If there’s something in your life you aren’t happy about, the realization that you can turn your life around anytime should be enough to counter the feeling of being lost.

You need to ensure that you’re not developing a victim mindset. While trauma, loss, or a significant setback can make you feel unsteady and drastically change your life. The change can still turn out to be positive. People have lost spouses, children, and even a sense of safety. And many have learned to take their loss and create a beautiful life from it. If a child or spouse dies suddenly and traumatically, you might consider starting an organization to help others in a similar situation cope or prevent it from happening again. If you’ve experienced a trauma, you can use the experience to rebuild yourself up in a new way. Some people choose to do good deeds every day to help put their life on a better path. Allow yourself to get out of your own way.

Avoid focusing on your imperfections and weaknesses. Everyone has flaws, and there’s absolutely nothing you can gain from obsessing about them. When you feel lost in life, the best thing you can do is focus on your best strengths. By shifting your perspective to the things you’re good at, you can gradually move forward. It’s far better to build up your strengths than worrying about weaknesses. Your best traits reflect the best parts of you. If you’re having negative thoughts, it will only bring you down. No matter what, your flaws are not a reflection of your capabilities.

And remember, your personality isn’t permanent. Think of how much you’ve changed since you were a child. You can swap out negative traits and replace them with positive characteristics anytime. Your brain is changeable. You can learn new skills. Pushing yourself in different ways is always possible. If feeling lost has made you reevaluate some aspects of the person you are today, remember you can decide who you want to be tomorrow.

This point might sound a little cliche, but your habits determine the outcome of your life. If you’re having unhealthy habits, such as constantly browsing mindlessly through social media posts, then you need to reevaluate your habits. Your habits can contribute to feeling lost in life, especially when the majority of your habits are unhealthy ones. With habits like social media consumption, it’s not entirely bad, but when it’s causing you to compare your life with everyone else’s, that’s when it becomes unhealthy. Like anything, moderation is key.

You can develop good habits at any time. Starting today, you can begin to do that social media detox, practice good deeds in every interaction, choose a different way to respond to a partner or child or anything else. When we’re feeling lost, it’s normal for there to be an increase in negative behavior. Still, by swapping that with a positive, compassionate, and kind attitude, we can begin to find the meaning that guides us back on track.

We often get stuck in our heads with an inner critic that makes us feel lost. While it’s normal to feel that way sometimes, you don’t want to become stuck in that mindset. When you read regularly, you learn new perspectives, skills, and solutions. The self-help genre is one of the biggest for a reason. Personal development books and articles can help you more than you realize, mainly when authors specialize in a specific topic. If you’re finding it difficult to cope with this feeling and not knowing what to do and where to go, now is the perfect time to read on personal development.

For instance, if you’re struggling to rewire your brain or with trauma, you might read books about how the brain works. Someone who is grieving a loss of a loved one might choose to read books about coping with grief or coping with depression. A person struggling with finding meaning in life might decide to read books about compassion, kindness, or philosophy. There’s a book for every need in life to help you transition from feeling lost to getting back on track.

Whether you realize this or not, it’s easy to dwell on negative emotions when you stay in one place for long periods. Emotions are fleeting. Still, by staying in one place, there’s a possibility to dwell in negativity and let your feelings consume you. Even when feeling lost, you might gain the inspiration you’re looking for by going outside and moving your body. Fresh air can do wonders for someone. Even something as simple as getting out of bed and taking a shower can create a slight improvement in your management of emotions.

If possible, consider going on a mini-vacation. You don’t need to jet-set on a plane to see a mental boost. Even going for a weekend getaway to cottage country, a popular tourist attraction, or a nice long hike in a forest can help you recharge your batteries. Life is meant to be lived out there in the world. So when you find you’re too in your head, get out into nature and explore. Take in all the sights, sounds, and smells that surround you.

Even when you feel lost, confused, and scared out of your mind, acknowledging who you are is the best thing you can do. Acknowledge this phase of your life, no matter how difficult it seems. When you affirm what you feel and everything that comes with it, it will be easier for you to move forward despite feeling lost. As long as you avoid dwelling in that loneliness, then you’ll be fine. Knowing who you are may also require you to look inward, which isn’t easy as it takes a certain level of self-awareness. You’re not a quitter or someone who gives up quickly. You’re able to learn new skills to help yourself out of this moment. Life hasn’t always been easy for you, but you’ve always managed to help yourself out of a tough time. This moment is no exception. You’re going to come out of this moment stronger than you went into it. It’s you. Of course, you can do it.

When you’re feeling lost, you can learn about the feeling more than you realize. We spend so much time with other people that we rarely take time for ourselves. When you’re feeling lost, it can show you that you need to pay more attention to what’s happening to spark a change in your life. As difficult as the feeling of being lost may seem, you need to learn from it and stop avoiding it. When you’re alone, you have no other choice but to face the truth and take the necessary action to make changes.

It’s time to take action. While feeling lost is something to come to terms with for this moment, you also need to set yourself up to move forward. You can’t deal with the feeling of being lost when you don’t do anything but dwell on it further. You will feel lost one way or another in your life, but what matters is what you choose to do about that feeling. If you feel lost because you’re not sure if you’ve taken the career path, ask yourself the question of whether you’re actively doing something that brings you closer to the career you want? Stop making excuses and think about the fact that it’s time to face the truth behind why you’re feeling the way you do.

One way to take action for your next step is to practice meditation. By practicing meditation, you’ll learn how to focus on something other than the wandering thoughts that sometimes lead you astray. Meditation is the first step towards mindful living. And once you start living mindful, you’ll begin to notice some of the negative experiences slip away. You’ll start to live more presently instead of reliving the past a million times or fearing the future. In the present moment, people don’t feel lost, scared, or confused. They’re too busy living, loving, and helping.

In this article, we highlighted ways to help you cope with feeling lost. This emotion is hard to deal with, but sometimes it’s the push we need to pivot in a new direction in life. Using the tips above, you can start taking action to help you transition away from feeling lost. It’s crucial not to catastrophize your feelings as that will only make them worse. Remember, like everything in life, feeling lost is temporary. You won’t feel this way forever. You can practice meditation, compassion, and kindness to help you find meaning in your life and build the confidence to move a step forward.

One of the worst feelings in the world is feeling lost in life. A person will probably go through it at some point in their life. Several things, including a lack of direction, fulfillment, or purpose, can make someone feel lost. It could feel as though life has no purpose right now. When this occurs, though, keep in mind that you should be gentle with yourself rather than criticize yourself for feeling disoriented. Fortunately, there are still strategies you may use to deal with this difficult circumstance. We’ll share some coping mechanisms with you in this article to assist you to deal with feeling lost.

When you’re lost, you’re unsure of what to do, how to feel, and where to go in life. We often start to doubt every area of our lives when we’re feeling lost, which sends us spinning out of control. People who are lost frequently expand a single minor setback or issue to multiple domains. This action is referred to as catastrophizing. This is why a small issue quickly becomes a major one.



1. Accept it:



We can change something that we can’t accept, remember?

Recognize that no matter how challenging it may appear to be lost, the feeling won’t last forever. Life’s sorrow is all transient. No exception exists. The more you try to suppress this emotion, the more likely it is that you won’t be able to handle it.

There’s nothing wrong with feeling lost, no matter how difficult it is to sit with your feelings. It would help if you also realized that sometimes feeling lost is the key to making necessary changes in your life to become better.

2. Realize you have more control than you think:

Your thoughts and emotions are under your control, not the other way around. You mold your life and build your current reality. You alone are responsible for the course of your life, thus you will always be in control. The knowledge that you can change your life at any time should be sufficient to counteract the sense of being lost if there is anything in your life about which you are unhappy.

3. Pay attention to your abilities and skills:

Do not dwell on your flaws and faults. There is nothing to be gained from fixating on someone else’s defects; everyone has them. The best thing you can do when you’re feeling lost in life is to concentrate on your strongest attributes. You can advance gradually by changing your focus to the things you excel.

4. Choose healthy habits:

Your habits can contribute to feeling lost in life, especially when the majority of your habits are unhealthy ones. Habits like social media consumption, it’s not entirely bad, but when it’s causing you to compare your life with everyone else’s, that’s when it becomes unhealthy. Like anything, moderation is key.

5. Have a change of environment

Whether you realize this or not, it’s easy to dwell on negative emotions when you stay in one place for long periods. Emotions are fleeting. Still, by staying in one place, there’s a possibility to dwell in negativity and let your feelings consume you. Even when feeling lost, you might gain the inspiration you’re looking for by going outside and moving your body. Fresh air can do wonders for someone. Even something as simple as getting out of bed and taking a shower can create a slight improvement in your management of emotions.

6. Recognize who you are:

Recognizing who you are is the best thing you can do, even when you’re completely bewildered, baffled, and terrified out of your mind. No matter how challenging this stage of your life looks, acknowledge it. It would be simpler for you to proceed even when you feel lost if you acknowledge how you feel and everything that goes along with it.

7. Feeling lost can help you learn:

You can discover more about the sense of being lost than you might think. We rarely take time for ourselves because we spend so much time with others. Feeling lost can be a sign that you need to pay closer attention to what’s going on to make changes in your life.

8. It’s time to act:

You must prepare yourself to move forward even if accepting that you are lost at this time is necessary. If you do nothing except continue to think about how lost you feel, you will never be able to handle it. You will experience feelings of loss at some point in your life, but what matters is what you decide to do about them. Ask yourself if you’re actively doing anything that moves you closer to the career you desire or if you’re feeling lost because you’re unsure if you’ve chosen the right path. Stop blaming others and consider the idea that it’s time to address the real reasons for your feelings.

Remember always to be kind to yourself and lead with compassion

The Olympics are almost upon us. During every Olympics, we see happy, heartwarming stories portrayed on television, but we also see desperately unhappy ones. We see favorites devastated to win silver, athletes who get fourth or miss making the final by a hundredth of a second, tragic injuries, and mistakes like dropping the baton in a running relay or falling off a beam. Anyone who watched the Olympics trials has already witnessed the extreme disappointment felt by those who didn't make the team.

You may have wondered how these intensely focused (and often competitive) people cope with the emotional fallout of losing. The truth is that pain is pain. All of us, non-athletes included, will cope with similar feelings at points in our lives. Anyone who strives for goals will sometimes experience bitter disappointment, grief, regret, while wondering "what if."

Here are some tips for coping with losing that apply not just to athletes, but to you, too.

When we're disappointed, we sometimes have untrue thoughts that intensify our painful feelings. For example, you might think:

Understand that these exaggerated thoughts are part of our response to feeling very hurt. Having a thought doesn't make it true. A particular performance doesn't sum up everything about you. For example, we saw gold-medal-winning gymnast Laurie Hernandez not make the US team this Olympics. It's not like one version of her is more real or true. Both are. She's both the person who won medals and the person who didn't make the team. 

Even if a painful thought has some truth to it, it's not immutable. For example, if your life has been focused mostly on one goal, then losing can provide freedom for that not to be the case anymore. 

Because the Olympics are once every four years, that is a rough situation compared to people who can try again with their goal shortly after failing or losing. However, at the end of the day, emotions feel the same no matter who is experiencing them or why. Intense disappointment, grief, regret, etc, all feel the same, no matter why we're experiencing them. And most of us will have had the experience of the end of a dream or needing to give up on a goal because we've hit some type of wall. 

The more you see your experience of pain as universally human, the less isolated and lonely you'll feel. When you see your pain as a factor that connects you with others (rather than separates you from others), it will motivate you to cope by reaching out and joining with others, rather than isolating yourself out of shame or a feeling that "no one else can understand."

Personal pain feels worse when it feels like it's the only thing that is going on in the world. I'm an atheist, but my go-to when I'm feeling emotional pain is to learn about nature, the universe, science, and ancient history. These topics take me out of myself, help lengthen my time perspective, and help me recognize that individual achievements are very limited compared to what people and humanity can do together.

Rumination is when you think the same thoughts over and over again. It's usually about events that have occurred, whereas worry is about future events that might occur. When people ruminate after losing, they mentally replay decisions and imagine how things might've worked out if they had made different decisions. For example, I've heard former contestants on competitive reality shows (like Survivor) talk about mentally rehashing their game for years after the fact. 

There are lots of proven strategies for coping with rumination. The first step is noticing when you're doing it. 

You don't have to merely survive emotional pain. You can become a more skilled, more resilient person because of it. A paradox is that it can be easier to get through terrible pain if you aim to grow from it rather than if you aim to merely survive it. In general, just trying to survive any experience is harder than trying to grow through it.

Over the past two years, I've spent an incredible amount of money on failed IVF. Aside from the money, it has also been a huge focus on my life. Other aspects of my life and career have been largely on hold. It's hard not to feel all the bitterness I've talked about throughout this post. It's hard not to think about all the other things I could've spent the money on, or where my career would be at if I hadn't devoted all my energy to unsuccessfully trying to have a baby. 

Yet, I have grown from it. I'm more empathic. Through participating in support groups, I've improved my skills at supporting others generally. My experience has reinforced my strengths as a persistent and tenacious person. And, I've learned that I can attempt goals without being sure I'll succeed at them.

To see how you might experience post-traumatic growth, look to role models. Look to people who are having fulfilling lives without having achieved the goal you failed to achieve. How are they doing it?

Consider a few sessions with a therapist. But don't go in without a clear goal. Specifically, ask your therapist to help you learn how to experience post-traumatic growth. If you need it, and you probably will, you can ask for help to curb rumination too. It's optimal to have a positive goal (to gain something) and not just a negative goal (to stop something), so these are a great combination, especially if you mostly focus on your positive goal. 

You won't be ready to think about post-traumatic growth until you've survived the initial psychological shock of losing or failing. Give yourself the grace to go through that phase, but don't let it last too long. About two weeks is about the maximum you should be in pure survival mode after an enormous shock or devastating disappointment before you start gently thinking about thriving.

Here's what to expect: Initially, after a loss or failure, you'll have a period in which you're only thinking about surviving your experience. Once you begin to emerge from it, you'll experience a mixture of thoughts and emotions, some about surviving, and some about growth and new goals. The balance of those will go up and down.

When you've experienced loss or failure, getting through it shouldn't be a passive experience. There are lots of techniques and skills that you can try that will influence how well you come through it. Start with whatever appeals to you from the suggestions offered here. Good luck!

What does it mean to feel lost?

7 tips for finding your way when you’re feeling lost

Focus on the journey: discovering what’s next

Everyone feels lost sometimes. 

Whether you’re in the midst of a major life transition or questioning a career pivot, feeling lost is a normal part of figuring out your next step. It’s often a sign of impending personal growth—an opportunity to accept new challenges and learn about yourself. 

It can be tricky to navigate making decisions while you’re feeling lost. Let’s take a closer look at what it’s like to feel lost and tips for taking your next step. 

Feeling lost is akin to feeling stagnant, in either your career or personal life. You recognize your current situation no longer serves you, but aren’t sure where to turn. For some individuals, it can feel similar to depression.



These are seven signs that you might be feeling lost:

You often reflect on the past.

You’re less optimistic about the future or questioning your life path.

You struggle to enjoy activities that you used to love.

You’re disinterested in how you’re spending time.

You feel unmotivated.

You feel like you’re in a rut.

You feel as though you’ve lost touch with your true self.

For most of us, feeling lost is a sign our personal values or goals have changed. Perhaps your career aspirations have shifted, so your present role no longer feels fulfilling, or you’ve recently experienced a substantial shift in your personal life that has left you feeling aimless. 

Feeling directionless can be a catalyst to explore new opportunities and grow as an individual. Look at it as a chance to rediscover your purpose and set a new intention for how you live your daily life. 

Many different kinds of live events or experiences can prompt feeling lost. Here are some common reasons, but remember you can still feel lost without having experienced a life-changing event.

Grieving a loved one

Ending a relationship

Starting a new job or making a big career transition

Missed opportunities in your professional or personal life

As we grow and evolve as people, our needs and goals change too. You may feel lost when your current life no longer aligns with your goals, values, or purpose.



Feeling lost is nothing to panic about. 

It’s important to remember that overcoming the sense of feeling lost doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a process of self-discovery filled with curiosity and patience. 

Picture yourself facing several doors, each one a new and exciting opportunity. You’re trying to determine which one to enter to bring more fulfillment to your life. 

Here are our top tips for finding your way when you feel lost. 

When you feel lost, you probably don’t spend much time reflecting on your strengths. This is exactly where you should start when setting out on your professional and personal development journey. 



To help you get started, consider brainstorming the following questions:

Where do you excel in your current role at work? 

What are your favorite parts of your day?

What empowers you?

What skills have helped you thrive?

When are you the most productive?

Make sure to include both hard and soft skills. Do you have incredible project management skills and love to collaborate with colleagues? Are you the person your friends turn to when they need advice or support? Listing your strengths can both encourage you and guide your next steps. 

If you find it useful, it could be helpful to examine your weaknesses as well. What skills would you like to improve? Keep them in mind as you seek opportunities for growth.

Our goals change as we do. It’s a normal and natural occurrence, but can understandably leave you feeling lost. Whether independently or with the support of a life coach, hold a magnifying glass up to your current goals. Ask yourself the following questions:

What are your current goals? Which of them still resonate with you, and which no longer excite you?

What do you care about right now? What passions, hobbies, and interests make you feel fulfilled?

What might it look like to incorporate these passions and interests into your daily life?

Pocket the answers to these questions. You can return to them for further reflection as you learn more about your passions. Look at your goals as things to reevaluate as you grow and change. 

Take extra care to support your body and mind. It’s taxing on your well-being to navigate unchartered territory. Go out of your way to care for yourself. Here are some healthy self-care habits to try:



Journal. If you don’t know what to write about, look up prompts online to guide your writing. A journaling practice is a great way to challenge negative self-talk and rediscover topics that excite you. 

Exercise. Move your body every day. Even going for a 20-minute walk during your lunch break counts. 

Eat the rainbow. Make sure you’re eating three meals a day with some snacks sprinkled in. Incorporate more fruit and veggies, experiment with new recipes, and discover new foods you enjoy. 

Rest. Prioritize time for genuine rest. That could mean spending an afternoon watching movies or hiking—whatever true rest looks like to you. 

Meditation or deep breathing exercises. These habits help regulate your nervous system, so you can calm your mind and feel grounded in the present moment.

Minimize social media use. Young people spend an average of 3.5 hours a day scrolling on social media. Too much time spent “doom scrolling” negatively impacts self-esteem and can contribute to feeling lost. 

Use these healthy habits to build a solid routine. Eventually they will become automatic, and sustaining beneficial activities won’t require as much effort. They can also help you stay well-equipped to handle more challenging situations. 

Trying something new activates the parts of your brain that release dopamine, a “feel good” hormone that makes us feel pleasure and excitement. Engaging in a new activity or pursuing a new interest promotes feelings of well-being.

Trying new things also boosts our brain’s neuroplasticity, its ability to change and be rewired. By putting yourself in new situations, your brain forms new neural connections. Neuroplasticity happens in response to learning new things, and is associated with improved cognitive functioning over the long term. 

Harvard Medical School recommends finding new activities that are challenging and fairly complex. Make sure you set aside dedicated time to practice these new activities. 

While making huge changes all at once might feel like the most productive way to reach a new goal, it’s not the most sustainable. You learn more about yourself and your interests by gradually chipping away at your new goals. Slow, small steps are huge leaps in the long term. 

If you try approaching an objective one way and it doesn’t resonate, you can pivot and try another route. Use each step forward as a chance to better understand what to do next. 

Feeling lost is a unique opportunity to set out on a new path. A professional coach or mentor can shed some light on what you should do next. Support like this can also help you handle complex emotions as they arise. 

Talk with someone you trust and who could view your situation from a new perspective. For example, if it’s time for a career change, seek the support of a career coach who can provide guidance.  

How would you speak to a friend if they were in your position? Odds are, you would tell them to be kind to themselves, create space for rest, and appreciate the process of learning about their new goals. Treat yourself as you would a close friend—be kind and patient. 

When you find yourself feeling anxious or impatient, take a step back and look at the situation objectively. Focus on making progress instead of performing every step perfectly. Keep an open mind, so you’re enabled to learn as you go. 

Feeling lost is an opportunity to explore a new part of yourself and perhaps pursue a new goal. You shouldn’t expect immediate results. Instead, focus on learning from the journey that comes from finding your way.

Take care as you explore your next steps and remember: you’re not alone. Working with a coach can provide guidance on how to rediscover your values and goals.

# Feeling Lost: 9 Ways to Cope When You Feel Lost

Feeling lost in life is one of the worst feelings in the world. It’s something that a person will likely experience at some point in their lives. Feeling lost can be caused by several factors, such as a lack of purpose, fulfillment, or direction. Right now, it may seem like life has no meaning. When this happens, though, remember that you need to go easy on yourself instead of blaming yourself for feeling lost. Fortunately, there are still ways you can cope with this challenging situation. In this article, we’ll be sharing some techniques to help you cope with feeling lost.

When you feel lost, you don’t know what to do, how to feel, and which direction to lead yourself. When feeling lost, we tend to question every aspect of our lives, spiraling us out of control. People who feel lost often take one small setback or problem and extend it to other areas. This process is known as catastrophizing. That’s why what starts as a minor problem grows big quickly.

You might begin to lack provision, direction, and purpose. You may even start second-guessing yourself and the things in which you’ve believed. This feeling eventually trickles down to countless areas, such as friendships, relationships, career paths, and personal growth.

Feeling overwhelmed with difficult situations can sometimes cause a sense of feeling lost. One of the most dangerous aspects of feeling lost is when you no longer recognize who you are, which affects your self-image and confidence. This feeling often creates a sense of detachment since you no longer identify with yourself. However, feeling lost is also sometimes necessary since we tend to run away from our painful emotions, complicated relationships, past trauma, and other challenging events. When you feel lost, it can raise an alarm bell that it’s time to pay attention to the truth you’re running away from and make necessary changes in your life.

No matter how difficult the feeling of being lost might seem, realize that it’s not a feeling that will last forever. All suffering in life is temporary. There’s no exception. The more you try to avoid this feeling, the more you likely won’t be able to cope with it. An inability to cope happens because we often tend to extrapolate it, understand it, and, thus, magnify it as a result. People who try to figure out what’s causing the issue instead of letting the feeling be often make the situation worse themselves. Overanalyzing a fleeting feeling often makes the feeling last longer. It’s essential to recognize that sometimes you’re going to feel negative emotions. Instead of dwelling on them, allow yourself to experience the sentiment since it isn’t lasting anyways.

There’s nothing wrong with feeling lost, no matter how difficult it is to sit with your feelings. It would help if you also realized that sometimes feeling lost is the key to making necessary changes in your life to becoming better. You can always use this feeling to your advantage and reflect on your life. Everyone feels lost at some point in their lives, but it’s up to you how you’re going to cope with that feeling.

You have control over your emotions and thoughts – not the other way around. You create your current reality, and you shape your life. Nobody else but you is in charge of how your life turns out, which means you will always have the upper hand. If there’s something in your life you aren’t happy about, the realization that you can turn your life around anytime should be enough to counter the feeling of being lost.

You need to ensure that you’re not developing a victim mindset. While trauma, loss, or a significant setback can make you feel unsteady and drastically change your life. The change can still turn out to be positive. People have lost spouses, children, and even a sense of safety. And many have learned to take their loss and create a beautiful life from it. If a child or spouse dies suddenly and traumatically, you might consider starting an organization to help others in a similar situation cope or prevent it from happening again. If you’ve experienced a trauma, you can use the experience to rebuild yourself up in a new way. Some people choose to do good deeds every day to help put their life on a better path. Allow yourself to get out of your own way.

Avoid focusing on your imperfections and weaknesses. Everyone has flaws, and there’s absolutely nothing you can gain from obsessing about them. When you feel lost in life, the best thing you can do is focus on your best strengths. By shifting your perspective to the things you’re good at, you can gradually move forward. It’s far better to build up your strengths than worrying about weaknesses. Your best traits reflect the best parts of you. If you’re having negative thoughts, it will only bring you down. No matter what, your flaws are not a reflection of your capabilities.

And remember, your personality isn’t permanent. Think of how much you’ve changed since you were a child. You can swap out negative traits and replace them with positive characteristics anytime. Your brain is changeable. You can learn new skills. Pushing yourself in different ways is always possible. If feeling lost has made you reevaluate some aspects of the person you are today, remember you can decide who you want to be tomorrow.

This point might sound a little cliche, but your habits determine the outcome of your life. If you’re having unhealthy habits, such as constantly browsing mindlessly through social media posts, then you need to reevaluate your habits. Your habits can contribute to feeling lost in life, especially when the majority of your habits are unhealthy ones. With habits like social media consumption, it’s not entirely bad, but when it’s causing you to compare your life with everyone else’s, that’s when it becomes unhealthy. Like anything, moderation is key.

You can develop good habits at any time. Starting today, you can begin to do that social media detox, practice good deeds in every interaction, choose a different way to respond to a partner or child or anything else. When we’re feeling lost, it’s normal for there to be an increase in negative behavior. Still, by swapping that with a positive, compassionate, and kind attitude, we can begin to find the meaning that guides us back on track.

We often get stuck in our heads with an inner critic that makes us feel lost. While it’s normal to feel that way sometimes, you don’t want to become stuck in that mindset. When you read regularly, you learn new perspectives, skills, and solutions. The self-help genre is one of the biggest for a reason. Personal development books and articles can help you more than you realize, mainly when authors specialize in a specific topic. If you’re finding it difficult to cope with this feeling and not knowing what to do and where to go, now is the perfect time to read on personal development.

For instance, if you’re struggling to rewire your brain or with trauma, you might read books about how the brain works. Someone who is grieving a loss of a loved one might choose to read books about coping with grief or coping with depression. A person struggling with finding meaning in life might decide to read books about compassion, kindness, or philosophy. There’s a book for every need in life to help you transition from feeling lost to getting back on track.

Whether you realize this or not, it’s easy to dwell on negative emotions when you stay in one place for long periods. Emotions are fleeting. Still, by staying in one place, there’s a possibility to dwell in negativity and let your feelings consume you. Even when feeling lost, you might gain the inspiration you’re looking for by going outside and moving your body. Fresh air can do wonders for someone. Even something as simple as getting out of bed and taking a shower can create a slight improvement in your management of emotions.

If possible, consider going on a mini-vacation. You don’t need to jet-set on a plane to see a mental boost. Even going for a weekend getaway to cottage country, a popular tourist attraction, or a nice long hike in a forest can help you recharge your batteries. Life is meant to be lived out there in the world. So when you find you’re too in your head, get out into nature and explore. Take in all the sights, sounds, and smells that surround you.

Even when you feel lost, confused, and scared out of your mind, acknowledging who you are is the best thing you can do. Acknowledge this phase of your life, no matter how difficult it seems. When you affirm what you feel and everything that comes with it, it will be easier for you to move forward despite feeling lost. As long as you avoid dwelling in that loneliness, then you’ll be fine. Knowing who you are may also require you to look inward, which isn’t easy as it takes a certain level of self-awareness. You’re not a quitter or someone who gives up quickly. You’re able to learn new skills to help yourself out of this moment. Life hasn’t always been easy for you, but you’ve always managed to help yourself out of a tough time. This moment is no exception. You’re going to come out of this moment stronger than you went into it. It’s you. Of course, you can do it.

When you’re feeling lost, you can learn about the feeling more than you realize. We spend so much time with other people that we rarely take time for ourselves. When you’re feeling lost, it can show you that you need to pay more attention to what’s happening to spark a change in your life. As difficult as the feeling of being lost may seem, you need to learn from it and stop avoiding it. When you’re alone, you have no other choice but to face the truth and take the necessary action to make changes.

It’s time to take action. While feeling lost is something to come to terms with for this moment, you also need to set yourself up to move forward. You can’t deal with the feeling of being lost when you don’t do anything but dwell on it further. You will feel lost one way or another in your life, but what matters is what you choose to do about that feeling. If you feel lost because you’re not sure if you’ve taken the career path, ask yourself the question of whether you’re actively doing something that brings you closer to the career you want? Stop making excuses and think about the fact that it’s time to face the truth behind why you’re feeling the way you do.

One way to take action for your next step is to practice meditation. By practicing meditation, you’ll learn how to focus on something other than the wandering thoughts that sometimes lead you astray. Meditation is the first step towards mindful living. And once you start living mindful, you’ll begin to notice some of the negative experiences slip away. You’ll start to live more presently instead of reliving the past a million times or fearing the future. In the present moment, people don’t feel lost, scared, or confused. They’re too busy living, loving, and helping.

In this article, we highlighted ways to help you cope with feeling lost. This emotion is hard to deal with, but sometimes it’s the push we need to pivot in a new direction in life. Using the tips above, you can start taking action to help you transition away from feeling lost. It’s crucial not to catastrophize your feelings as that will only make them worse. Remember, like everything in life, feeling lost is temporary. You won’t feel this way forever. You can practice meditation, compassion, and kindness to help you find meaning in your life and build the confidence to move a step forward.

# Feeling Lost? Here Are Four Steps to Finding Your Path

In Action •
In Education


In difficult life circumstances, you’re bound to feel anger, sadness, anxiety, or apathy. Whatever your situation is, it can be hard to look it square in the face. It might feel too painful or overwhelming to even know where to begin. 

For example, when you look at your life on paper, you might think you have it pretty good. You’re relatively healthy, have a stable income, a roof over your head and food on the table, and some family and friends whom you keep in touch with and could call if you really needed something. 

And yet, as the days pass and blur into one another, you’re wondering if this is really it? 

Or it might be that you’re going through, or have undergone, a significant life change. Perhaps a medical issue or diagnosis that has long-term implications for what your life will look like. It could be coming to terms with the unexpected death of a loved one, or the ending of a relationship that was the backbone of your being for much of your adult life. 

You feel at a crossroads, wondering how to move your life forward in the face of such change. 

The most common way for us to deal with these difficult or uncomfortable situations? You probably guessed it—through distraction. Finding something, anything, to keep your mind busy and away from any painful or uncomfortable reality. But while distraction can be a great tool to help with emotion regulation, it’s not a long-term solution to helping you see a way forward.   

So whether you have settled into a life situation that has somehow lost its luster or are dealing with a more acute situation, like a medical illness, divorce, or job loss, now is the right time to check in with yourself about where you are in life and the direction you’re headed. Even if you feel things are actually going pretty well, you might be surprised to find that something is missing, if you only stopped to take a peek.

How does one check in about their life direction to see if they’re on the right track? It’s important to say that being on track has to do with how you feel about your life from the inside, not from the outside. And this is where your values come into play. Not value, as in how much you paid for something, but values, as in what gives you purpose or meaning.

It’s important to know the difference here between values and goals. Goals are things that go on your to-do list so that you can eventually cross them off. Values, on the other hand, are never achieved. If you value spending time in nature, you’re not somehow done with being in nature after a weekend of camping. Instead, you did something that was in line with your values, but there are always more ways you can live out, or embody, this value. 

A great metaphor is to imagine your values as your compass or your North Star. If you don’t know if the direction you’re heading in is the right one for you, you can look to your values for guidance. Values help us get unlost by bringing clarity to imbue our life with meaning and help us do important things, even if they are hard.

Here are a few simple steps to help you uncover your values and put them into practice. 

Values can be derived from pretty much any area of life, which means you have a lot to choose from! You can value your physical health, spirituality, friendships, romantic relationships, work, the environment, contributing to your community, etc. The list goes on. 



This graphic provides an overview of different life areas to give you a starting point. The figure also includes some questions you can ask yourself to better understand what you value within each domain, but we’ll come to that in the next step. 

When you look at the graphic, it may be that many of the value areas seem at least somewhat important to you, and it may feel hard to choose. Try not to get caught up in choosing which area is “most important” to you. The good thing is that you can have values across all these different life domains. Valuing one area doesn’t mean that another one is unimportant to you. 

Or you might find the opposite is true, where only a few domains really resonate with you as sources of meaning. This is also completely fine. The goal is not to have as many values as possible, but rather to identify the things that will bring the most meaning into your life. 

Another important point is that your values are freely chosen, not because you think you should value something or because you think it’s expected of you. Being a parent is a good example. If you’re a parent, you might feel pressure to say that parenting is one of your top value areas. It’s not that you don’t love or value your child, but the parenting role itself just might not give you the same satisfaction or joy that it does for other people.  

If this is true for you, then you don’t need to pretend otherwise. You can still eventually identify some values around parenting to inform the way you act as a parent, but it may not be the life area you start with for now to help you find meaningful direction in life. 

With this in mind, for simplicity, start by identifying two or three life areas that really stand out to you and go through the entire exercise with those. You can then come back and work your way through other life domains that you also want to explore.

 

Now that you’ve got a few life areas that you think will bring meaning, it’s time to drill down and see what exactly the sources of meaning are for you. 

Let’s stick with the parenting example. “I want to be a good parent” is something you might say to yourself initially. And this is a great first step. But then you’ll want to take it a step further and ask yourself, “What kind of parent do I want to be? What are the qualities that I want my children to see in me?”

These questions will help you get at what’s important to you in your role as a parent, not to any generic parent. 

For example, one person might say that infusing daily life with fun and celebration is important, for another it’s being dependable, and for someone else it’s approaching parenting with curiosity. Despite all valuing the broad life area of parenting, the specific values themselves are quite different, which means the behaviors chosen to embody these values will also look different. More on that in the next step.

 Take a look at the questions in the graphic for your chosen life domain(s) to help you identify what the underlying values are. Take a few minutes to write out why these values are important to you. The act of writing out and explaining what your values are and why they’re important makes it more likely that your behaviors will follow suit.

If you find you’re still stuck at this point, a little exercise that can help you uncover your values is to imagine your own retirement party or your own funeral. The death part might sound a bit off-putting, but reflecting on one’s own inevitable mortality can help you focus on your personal motivations and live more authentically.

Whichever scenario you choose, imagine that a close colleague or loved one is standing up and saying a few words about you. Sure, they might talk about some of the projects you completed during your life, but mostly they will describe how you went about your work or led your life. 

If you imagine the uncensored version, where you lived your life according to what you stood for and what you cared about, what would the person standing up there say about you and your life? Take a few minutes to really visualize this. 

If any new values came up, be sure to write them down and explain why they’re important to you. If any strong emotions came up, know that that’s normal. Take some deep breaths; you can always return to this at a later time. 

Now that you’ve uncovered and clarified a few values, the next step is to identify activities that are consistent with your values. Remember, you can’t put your values on your to-do list, but you can put actions on your to-do list that are consistent with your values. 

When your self-image takes a hit, reflect on what matters

Let’s say that contributing to your community is important to you and, specifically, supporting young people through hard times. From here, brainstorm different activities that would embody this value. Be creative and don’t limit yourself to things you are already doing. You can decide later which ideas you actually want to put into practice.

In this case, your brainstorming session might lead you to a few different ideas: volunteering at a children’s hospital, agreeing to be a “big sibling” in a youth mentorship program, or tutoring your neighbor’s child who is struggling with math. As you can see, there are lots of different activities that can bring this value to life. 

Also keep in mind that the behaviors themselves do not need to be big things. Let’s say you focus on the domain of recreation, and your specific value is to physically allow your body to relax and let go of its stress. Although a week-long beach vacation might be one example, it’s not realistic to do this all the time. Make sure to have smaller, everyday-type behaviors in your list, as well—things like taking a bath, doing progressive muscle relaxation, or self/partner massage are all good examples that don’t cost much in the way of time or money. 

Now that you have some ideas on hand for what it looks like to embody your values, take a moment to reflect on how this compares to the things you are already doing. You may already be doing some (or many!) things consistent with your values. In which case, feel free to give yourself a well-deserved pat on the back. Living consistent with your values is not always easy. 

On the other hand, you may find that, currently, some important values are not getting the love and attention they deserve. If this describes your situation, know that this is common and may help to explain why you’re not feeling your best. The good news is that you now know the activities or behaviors that are deserving of your energy and, therefore, where to invest your time and resources. 

Like with all behavior change, start small to build a sustainable new practice. Pick one or two activities that are aligned with your values, either new behaviors or things you’re already doing of which you’d like to increase the frequency. Take a look at your calendar and schedule in times to put these activities into practice. If your activity is something that requires a few steps (e.g., volunteering at a children’s hospital), go ahead and find a time to carry out the first step.

If you’re someone for whom valued activities appear very minimally in your life at the moment, start by integrating value-based activities that are within easy reach to build your practice. For example, instead of starting with going back to school to get a master’s degree as an embodiment of valuing lifelong learning, first try attending a public seminar at your local college or university or a free class in an online open course on a topic that excites you. 

The more we engage in behaviors aligned with our values, the less distress, suffering, and depression we tend to feel, and the better we function overall. It’s also easier to do things that are hard or uncomfortable, like leaving a job that provides security but leaves you feeling empty, or bringing a relationship to a close that no longer provides you with fulfillment. 

There’s also some evidence that clarifying your values can lead to a lower biological stress reaction, like lower cortisol levels.

So whether you’re feeling directionless or full of clarity, use this as an opportunity to take stock of your personal values and how your behaviors stack up. Knowing this will help you to keep to the same path or offer an opportunity to course-correct, both of which are valuable insights.

# Why Do I Feel Lost? What it Means and 6 Things to Do About It

If you’re feeling lost in life — stuck, lacking motivation, or aimless — here are some things that might help. 

Though most people don’t talk about it, it’s a feeling many people get. 

You might feel like you don’t know the next step to take in life. You might feel helpless, emotionally numb, or like you’ve lost your spark. 

Many things can make you feel lost, like the end of a relationship, missed opportunities, or an awareness of your life not moving in the direction you imagined. Sometimes, you aren’t sure why you feel lost, but you can’t shake the feeling of being utterly aimless, floating from random task to random task.

There are many reasons why you might feel lost, but there are also many ways you can try to find yourself again. 

“Feeling lost feels a lot like depression,” says Carolyn Ferreira, PsyD, a psychologist who helps people rebuild relationships and recover from trauma and addictions. 

If you feel lost in life, you might feel unmotivated and uninterested in your hobbies, she says. You might feel “like life is meaningless.” You might no longer recognize yourself.

You also might feel like you’ve lost sight of the person you want to be, says Danielle Kepler, a licensed clinical professional counselor based in Chicago who specializes in treating adults with anxiety, depression, and life transitions, as well as couples with relationship issues.

It also can feel like you’ve always felt this lost, and you always will, Kepler says. “You might struggle to remember a time when you felt like your ‘old self.’” You may “see no way out of it.”

But know that there is a way out. In fact, there are many ways. Here are some things you can do when you feel lost: 

Denying our emotions can often do more harm than good.

“When a person acknowledges their feeling of being lost emotionally, they can then attend to it,” says Colleen Mullen, PsyD, a licensed marriage and family therapist, psychotherapist, and founder of the Coaching Through Chaos private practice and podcast in San Diego.

Remind yourself it’s OK to feel sad, disappointed, or helpless, she says. “These are natural consequences when our life path changes abruptly in a direction we did not want.”

It also can help to write about your feelings through journaling. Try writing about how you’re feeling and why you’re feeling this way. Describe your physical sensations. Document your thoughts. Get it all down on paper.

After you’ve acknowledged how you’re feeling, Mullen suggested soothing yourself with practices such as:

Also, try being kind to yourself. For instance, when thoughts like, “Oh, I can’t believe this is happening,” or “I don’t know why I am even trying” arise, you might tell yourself, “I can handle this,” or “If I’m overwhelmed, I can take a break,” she says.

“Remind yourself that although you may feel your circumstances are out of your control, you can still control how you react to them.”

“Any movement you make when you feel lost will feel like progress,” Ferreira says. For instance, you might keep your nourishing bedtime routine and your weekly lunch with your best friend because you always feel better after talking with them.

What matters to you? What’s important? Ferreira suggested working through a values worksheet, which you can find online. 

“Pick one or two values that resonate with you and do something that is in line with that.” She shares this example: One of your values is justice, so you start volunteering at a local nonprofit.

Kepler suggests clients think of someone they admire. This might be a mentor, colleague, or friend. She asks them to identify the specific qualities they admire. 

For instance, maybe you admire your colleague’s friendliness, kindness, and ability to assert themselves, she says. “These are often values that [you] feel are important; it’s just somewhat easier to identify them in other people than [yourself].”

It might help to see a motivational speaker, attend a guest lecture at a university, or check out a business networking event, Ferreira says. 

“Attending an inspirational event can help you remember what you’re passionate about.” It also can help you connect to like-minded people, she said. And “sometimes just the energy in the room from such an event can be enough to get a person going again.”

Consider working with a therapist or joining a support group that focuses on what you’re dealing with, says Mullen. She suggests researching whatever issue you’re trying to navigate. For instance, if you’re dealing with grief, try looking for memoirs and self-help books on the subject.

It’s hard to know what to do when you feel lost. A good place to start is to spend some time acknowledging and understanding why you’re feeling this way.

Even though it might be painful or frustrating, feeling lost can become an opportunity for growth. 

“Feeling lost can redirect us toward what really matters to us,” Ferreira says. It can inspire us to take a trip and savor new experiences. It can inspire us to take a different job, which starts to fulfill us. It can inspire us to join a support group to find our tribe.

Looking for mental health support but not sure where to start? Psych Central’s How to Find Mental Health Support resource can help.

Feeling lost can be the first step in creating a more fulfilling life and be the first step in reconnecting with yourself.

# Why It’s Okay to Feel Lost (And How to Find Your Way Again)



“Feeling lost, crazy and desperate belongs to a good life as much as optimism, certainty and reason.” ~Alain de Botton

Do you feel lost and alone?

Adrift and confused about which way to go?

Do you long for “something more” but have no clue what’s missing?

Maybe you’re not miserable exactly, but you’re not animated and in love with life either.

Your circumstances may even look pretty good on the outside.

But on the inside, where truth resides, you are bored to tears, unfulfilled, and restless.

Or maybe you are miserable, stuck in a painful place, silently suffering.

Trust me; I know what that feels like.

I felt lost as an introverted, highly sensitive soul struggling to conform to my environment.

I felt lost as I endured the shame of a teen pregnancy and years of pent-up grief over the adoption of my baby.

And I felt completely lost when I realized that I had spent over twenty years pursuing work that was utterly wrong for me.

For decades, I tried to just ignore the disturbing aspects of my life. I became good at distracting myself with routines and habits that brought me a sense of peace, however superficial.

Some of these habits even turned into addictions I had to overcome, but that’s another story.

With no real sense of identity or direction, I mostly did as I was told, stayed on the periphery of things, and focused on giving others what I thought they wanted from me.

Until I became so weary with my soul-crushing job and so depleted by not honoring my true nature that I felt like I’d die if I didn’t make a change.

But if I wasn’t going to do this work anymore, what was I going to do?

And how would I honor my true nature when I didn’t even know who I was or what I really wanted?

I sure have lost my way a lot in life.

It’s scary. But it’s okay. Because feeling lost can be a good thing. Let me show you why.

All feelings arise to show you something about yourself and your life.

Feeling lost doesn’t mean you’re doomed or that your life is hopeless. It simply means that something better is waiting for you.

Maybe you’ve been conducting your life based on what others believe is right, and you lost sight of what you really want.

Maybe you’ve been valuing the opinions of others over your own inner knowing.

Maybe you’ve been spending too much time with people who drag you down rather than lift you up.

These are all behaviors that, sooner or later, lead to discomfort. And they are all signs that something new and more suitable will ultimately happen.

Remember the sheer joy of discovery you experienced as a child when you learned things just because you were curious? Well, you can keep doing that as an adult, and it can be just as much fun.

Genuine curiosity—the persistent pursuit of understanding that leads to awareness and improvement—is an invitation to look into something not only with your mind but also with your heart and soul.

Asking lots of questions sparks interesting ideas and creates all kinds of connections; it opens up more options and opportunities.

Many of us have struggled to conform to our environment or life roles and lost sight of who we truly are.

Feeling lost is an opportunity to slow down the hectic busyness of your life, listen to your heart, and discover what matters most to you.

You can take time to rediscover your natural talents, the elements of your personality that have always been there. You can identify your deepest needs, values, and wishes.

The more you understand yourself, the easier you can detect what wants to happen next.

We humans have a strong need to control, fix, and influence everything.

The problem with thinking we know all the answers and trying to manage outcomes is that we end up shrinking, or getting stuck in place, rather than growing.

Feeling lost and confused isn’t meant to stop you in your tracks. It’s meant to beckon you forward along the path intended especially for you.

Venturing into this unknown territory can have an enchanting sense of possibility and freedom to it.

Life is meant to be an adventure in becoming, a blossoming into who you are meant to be. The most excellent adventure of all.

We’ve all struggled at one time or another with not knowing who we are, what we really want, or where we’re headed. Lessen your discomfort by reaching out to a friend you trust for empathy and gentle listening.

A good friend can serve as a sacred container, especially during life’s transitions. Through dialogue and honest sharing, friends can often reach a higher level of insight together.

Also remember that we belong to a larger universe that supports us and is an unwavering source of unconditional love, wisdom, and healing.

Use prayer or any other practice you enjoy to build your personal connection to your higher power. This reliable connection can stabilize you during times of uncertainty.

Meditation, deep breathing, quiet time in nature, yoga, journaling, arts, crafts, and exercise. These are all proven ways to increase well-being. Choose something that works for you, and do it every day.

Stillness and silence are especially nurturing, and you can keep it simple. Try the following short breathing exercise.

Close your eyes and focus your attention on your breath passing in and out through your nostrils. Smile as you breathe, and within a few moments, your whole body will start to relax.

Several times a day, take sixty seconds to do this. That’s all—just sixty seconds. Allow your breath to take you to your quiet, calm center.

“In the attitude of silence, the soul finds the path in a clearer light,” said Mahatma Gandhi, “and what is elusive and deceptive resolves itself into crystal clearness.”

Reawaken your curiosity, your childlike sense of wonder and openness.

The world is a fascinating place, and there are so many interesting things to learn about. Look around for inspiration and new interests.

Stretch out of your comfort zone by trying new things and meeting new people.

Use curiosity for self-understanding too. Ask yourself meaningful questions, and write about, draw, paint, or make a collage around anything that comes to you.

The following questions can get you started:

What does it mean to be a truly powerful human being?

In the words of spiritual teacher Gary Zukaz, “Authentic power is energy that is formed by the intentions of the soul. And, you are only as powerful as that for which you stand.”

So ask yourself, “What do I stand for?” And listen to your heart. You might also ask, “Who do I want to become?”

It’s okay if the answers don’t come right away. Just keep asking and listening for as long as necessary. It will be worth the wait.

Because the answers to those vital questions will reveal the very best you, the strongest, most generous you.

Remember that no matter what your circumstances or how lost you feel, you have the power to choose your direction and how to use your energy.

One fine day you will find your way from confusion to clarity.

Until then, stand tall in your unique personal power, and trust that all will be revealed to you when the timing is right.

You are moving, changing, and growing at the exact right pace.

Stay curious, and be gentle with yourself.

Your something better is right around the corner, inspiring and surprising, just waiting to be found.

# Why It’s Okay to Feel Lost (And How to Find Your Way Again)



“Feeling lost, crazy and desperate belongs to a good life as much as optimism, certainty and reason.” ~Alain de Botton

Do you feel lost and alone?

Adrift and confused about which way to go?

Do you long for “something more” but have no clue what’s missing?

Maybe you’re not miserable exactly, but you’re not animated and in love with life either.

Your circumstances may even look pretty good on the outside.

But on the inside, where truth resides, you are bored to tears, unfulfilled, and restless.

Or maybe you are miserable, stuck in a painful place, silently suffering.

Trust me; I know what that feels like.

I felt lost as an introverted, highly sensitive soul struggling to conform to my environment.

I felt lost as I endured the shame of a teen pregnancy and years of pent-up grief over the adoption of my baby.

And I felt completely lost when I realized that I had spent over twenty years pursuing work that was utterly wrong for me.

For decades, I tried to just ignore the disturbing aspects of my life. I became good at distracting myself with routines and habits that brought me a sense of peace, however superficial.

Some of these habits even turned into addictions I had to overcome, but that’s another story.

With no real sense of identity or direction, I mostly did as I was told, stayed on the periphery of things, and focused on giving others what I thought they wanted from me.

Until I became so weary with my soul-crushing job and so depleted by not honoring my true nature that I felt like I’d die if I didn’t make a change.

But if I wasn’t going to do this work anymore, what was I going to do?

And how would I honor my true nature when I didn’t even know who I was or what I really wanted?

I sure have lost my way a lot in life.

It’s scary. But it’s okay. Because feeling lost can be a good thing. Let me show you why.

All feelings arise to show you something about yourself and your life.

Feeling lost doesn’t mean you’re doomed or that your life is hopeless. It simply means that something better is waiting for you.

Maybe you’ve been conducting your life based on what others believe is right, and you lost sight of what you really want.

Maybe you’ve been valuing the opinions of others over your own inner knowing.

Maybe you’ve been spending too much time with people who drag you down rather than lift you up.

These are all behaviors that, sooner or later, lead to discomfort. And they are all signs that something new and more suitable will ultimately happen.

Remember the sheer joy of discovery you experienced as a child when you learned things just because you were curious? Well, you can keep doing that as an adult, and it can be just as much fun.

Genuine curiosity—the persistent pursuit of understanding that leads to awareness and improvement—is an invitation to look into something not only with your mind but also with your heart and soul.

Asking lots of questions sparks interesting ideas and creates all kinds of connections; it opens up more options and opportunities.

Many of us have struggled to conform to our environment or life roles and lost sight of who we truly are.

Feeling lost is an opportunity to slow down the hectic busyness of your life, listen to your heart, and discover what matters most to you.

You can take time to rediscover your natural talents, the elements of your personality that have always been there. You can identify your deepest needs, values, and wishes.

The more you understand yourself, the easier you can detect what wants to happen next.

We humans have a strong need to control, fix, and influence everything.

The problem with thinking we know all the answers and trying to manage outcomes is that we end up shrinking, or getting stuck in place, rather than growing.

Feeling lost and confused isn’t meant to stop you in your tracks. It’s meant to beckon you forward along the path intended especially for you.

Venturing into this unknown territory can have an enchanting sense of possibility and freedom to it.

Life is meant to be an adventure in becoming, a blossoming into who you are meant to be. The most excellent adventure of all.

We’ve all struggled at one time or another with not knowing who we are, what we really want, or where we’re headed. Lessen your discomfort by reaching out to a friend you trust for empathy and gentle listening.

A good friend can serve as a sacred container, especially during life’s transitions. Through dialogue and honest sharing, friends can often reach a higher level of insight together.

Also remember that we belong to a larger universe that supports us and is an unwavering source of unconditional love, wisdom, and healing.

Use prayer or any other practice you enjoy to build your personal connection to your higher power. This reliable connection can stabilize you during times of uncertainty.

Meditation, deep breathing, quiet time in nature, yoga, journaling, arts, crafts, and exercise. These are all proven ways to increase well-being. Choose something that works for you, and do it every day.

Stillness and silence are especially nurturing, and you can keep it simple. Try the following short breathing exercise.

Close your eyes and focus your attention on your breath passing in and out through your nostrils. Smile as you breathe, and within a few moments, your whole body will start to relax.

Several times a day, take sixty seconds to do this. That’s all—just sixty seconds. Allow your breath to take you to your quiet, calm center.

“In the attitude of silence, the soul finds the path in a clearer light,” said Mahatma Gandhi, “and what is elusive and deceptive resolves itself into crystal clearness.”

Reawaken your curiosity, your childlike sense of wonder and openness.

The world is a fascinating place, and there are so many interesting things to learn about. Look around for inspiration and new interests.

Stretch out of your comfort zone by trying new things and meeting new people.

Use curiosity for self-understanding too. Ask yourself meaningful questions, and write about, draw, paint, or make a collage around anything that comes to you.

The following questions can get you started:

What does it mean to be a truly powerful human being?

In the words of spiritual teacher Gary Zukaz, “Authentic power is energy that is formed by the intentions of the soul. And, you are only as powerful as that for which you stand.”

So ask yourself, “What do I stand for?” And listen to your heart. You might also ask, “Who do I want to become?”

It’s okay if the answers don’t come right away. Just keep asking and listening for as long as necessary. It will be worth the wait.

Because the answers to those vital questions will reveal the very best you, the strongest, most generous you.

Remember that no matter what your circumstances or how lost you feel, you have the power to choose your direction and how to use your energy.

One fine day you will find your way from confusion to clarity.

Until then, stand tall in your unique personal power, and trust that all will be revealed to you when the timing is right.

You are moving, changing, and growing at the exact right pace.

Stay curious, and be gentle with yourself.

Your something better is right around the corner, inspiring and surprising, just waiting to be found.

What does it mean to feel lost?

7 tips for finding your way when you’re feeling lost

Focus on the journey: discovering what’s next

Everyone feels lost sometimes. 

Whether you’re in the midst of a major life transition or questioning a career pivot, feeling lost is a normal part of figuring out your next step. It’s often a sign of impending personal growth—an opportunity to accept new challenges and learn about yourself. 

It can be tricky to navigate making decisions while you’re feeling lost. Let’s take a closer look at what it’s like to feel lost and tips for taking your next step. 

Feeling lost is akin to feeling stagnant, in either your career or personal life. You recognize your current situation no longer serves you, but aren’t sure where to turn. For some individuals, it can feel similar to depression.



These are seven signs that you might be feeling lost:

You often reflect on the past.

You’re less optimistic about the future or questioning your life path.

You struggle to enjoy activities that you used to love.

You’re disinterested in how you’re spending time.

You feel unmotivated.

You feel like you’re in a rut.

You feel as though you’ve lost touch with your true self.

For most of us, feeling lost is a sign our personal values or goals have changed. Perhaps your career aspirations have shifted, so your present role no longer feels fulfilling, or you’ve recently experienced a substantial shift in your personal life that has left you feeling aimless. 

Feeling directionless can be a catalyst to explore new opportunities and grow as an individual. Look at it as a chance to rediscover your purpose and set a new intention for how you live your daily life. 

Many different kinds of live events or experiences can prompt feeling lost. Here are some common reasons, but remember you can still feel lost without having experienced a life-changing event.

Grieving a loved one

Ending a relationship

Starting a new job or making a big career transition

Missed opportunities in your professional or personal life

As we grow and evolve as people, our needs and goals change too. You may feel lost when your current life no longer aligns with your goals, values, or purpose.



Feeling lost is nothing to panic about. 

It’s important to remember that overcoming the sense of feeling lost doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a process of self-discovery filled with curiosity and patience. 

Picture yourself facing several doors, each one a new and exciting opportunity. You’re trying to determine which one to enter to bring more fulfillment to your life. 

Here are our top tips for finding your way when you feel lost. 

When you feel lost, you probably don’t spend much time reflecting on your strengths. This is exactly where you should start when setting out on your professional and personal development journey. 



To help you get started, consider brainstorming the following questions:

Where do you excel in your current role at work? 

What are your favorite parts of your day?

What empowers you?

What skills have helped you thrive?

When are you the most productive?

Make sure to include both hard and soft skills. Do you have incredible project management skills and love to collaborate with colleagues? Are you the person your friends turn to when they need advice or support? Listing your strengths can both encourage you and guide your next steps. 

If you find it useful, it could be helpful to examine your weaknesses as well. What skills would you like to improve? Keep them in mind as you seek opportunities for growth.

Our goals change as we do. It’s a normal and natural occurrence, but can understandably leave you feeling lost. Whether independently or with the support of a life coach, hold a magnifying glass up to your current goals. Ask yourself the following questions:

What are your current goals? Which of them still resonate with you, and which no longer excite you?

What do you care about right now? What passions, hobbies, and interests make you feel fulfilled?

What might it look like to incorporate these passions and interests into your daily life?

Pocket the answers to these questions. You can return to them for further reflection as you learn more about your passions. Look at your goals as things to reevaluate as you grow and change. 

Take extra care to support your body and mind. It’s taxing on your well-being to navigate unchartered territory. Go out of your way to care for yourself. Here are some healthy self-care habits to try:



Journal. If you don’t know what to write about, look up prompts online to guide your writing. A journaling practice is a great way to challenge negative self-talk and rediscover topics that excite you. 

Exercise. Move your body every day. Even going for a 20-minute walk during your lunch break counts. 

Eat the rainbow. Make sure you’re eating three meals a day with some snacks sprinkled in. Incorporate more fruit and veggies, experiment with new recipes, and discover new foods you enjoy. 

Rest. Prioritize time for genuine rest. That could mean spending an afternoon watching movies or hiking—whatever true rest looks like to you. 

Meditation or deep breathing exercises. These habits help regulate your nervous system, so you can calm your mind and feel grounded in the present moment.

Minimize social media use. Young people spend an average of 3.5 hours a day scrolling on social media. Too much time spent “doom scrolling” negatively impacts self-esteem and can contribute to feeling lost. 

Use these healthy habits to build a solid routine. Eventually they will become automatic, and sustaining beneficial activities won’t require as much effort. They can also help you stay well-equipped to handle more challenging situations. 

Trying something new activates the parts of your brain that release dopamine, a “feel good” hormone that makes us feel pleasure and excitement. Engaging in a new activity or pursuing a new interest promotes feelings of well-being.

Trying new things also boosts our brain’s neuroplasticity, its ability to change and be rewired. By putting yourself in new situations, your brain forms new neural connections. Neuroplasticity happens in response to learning new things, and is associated with improved cognitive functioning over the long term. 

Harvard Medical School recommends finding new activities that are challenging and fairly complex. Make sure you set aside dedicated time to practice these new activities. 

While making huge changes all at once might feel like the most productive way to reach a new goal, it’s not the most sustainable. You learn more about yourself and your interests by gradually chipping away at your new goals. Slow, small steps are huge leaps in the long term. 

If you try approaching an objective one way and it doesn’t resonate, you can pivot and try another route. Use each step forward as a chance to better understand what to do next. 

Feeling lost is a unique opportunity to set out on a new path. A professional coach or mentor can shed some light on what you should do next. Support like this can also help you handle complex emotions as they arise. 

Talk with someone you trust and who could view your situation from a new perspective. For example, if it’s time for a career change, seek the support of a career coach who can provide guidance.  

How would you speak to a friend if they were in your position? Odds are, you would tell them to be kind to themselves, create space for rest, and appreciate the process of learning about their new goals. Treat yourself as you would a close friend—be kind and patient. 

When you find yourself feeling anxious or impatient, take a step back and look at the situation objectively. Focus on making progress instead of performing every step perfectly. Keep an open mind, so you’re enabled to learn as you go. 

Feeling lost is an opportunity to explore a new part of yourself and perhaps pursue a new goal. You shouldn’t expect immediate results. Instead, focus on learning from the journey that comes from finding your way.

Take care as you explore your next steps and remember: you’re not alone. Working with a coach can provide guidance on how to rediscover your values and goals.

# Rediscovering Yourself When You Feel Lost and Uninterested With Life

I’ve been so lost lately. For a few months actually. I haven’t known where I’ve wanted to live, what I want to do with my time, or even what I want to do for work. I’ve felt unfulfilled to say the least. I’m the freest I’ve ever been in my life, but I’d also agree I’m the most unfulfilled and lost. I feel stuck in the biggest rut, moving from one place and one thing to another as soon as that doesn't feel right, or lead to happiness. It might sound extreme, but I now feel like I'm having an identity crisis. 

I’ve read every single article over the past month on finding and getting to know yourself. It sounds crazy because you’re supposed to know yourself better than anyone else, right? But I don’t think I know myself at all. Not really. Even when I think I do, it’s probably who I was a few years ago, not now. 

Because of that, I’ve decided to embark on a real journey of self-discovery. I’m fed up with feeling fed up and although I don’t know what I want in life, I do know that I never want to feel this way again. It’s been the lowest point, and something I’ve wanted to shake but haven’t been able to despite trying. 

Something has to change.

Read on for 6 things to remember when you’re feeling lost and uninterested with life, as well as reasons for a self-discovery journey.

Even calling this a self-discovery journey is so woo-woo that it feels ridiculous. But it’s the only thing I’ve never really tried: truly getting to know myself that is. I never want to blame my past for anything, but there were quite a lot of big transitions and life changes over the past three years that I’ve never fully addressed. I’ve always distracted myself and poured positive energy into creating or writing, instead of facing what I needed to, fearing it would lead me into a negative spiral I’d never get out of. 

But now I’m on this journey of doing everything I can to rediscover my passions, dig deep to understand what I want from life and start loving my life again. I’m dedicating a year to myself in the hopes that by the end of it, I’ll feel very different to the way I do now. 

I’ve thought about whether to share this, but you can almost guarantee that the minute I go quiet on here it’s because of personal things I’m dealing with. This blog started as a way of sharing my hardest times, but somehow along the way I've replaced it with the belief that I’m supposed to have it all together by now. As a result, I go quiet when it’s not the case. Like now.

I also know this process will be long and hard, with a lot of tears, patience and new things I need to try. I want to share a little more of that, for those of you that also feel the same; that horrible feeling that you're uninspired and lost but not sure what to do about it.

 It won’t be an overnight fix, I know that. But something about sharing this journey I’m on also gives me motivation to actually do the things I know I need to do to feel better. And it can be exciting too, to think of the possibilities that will come from that. 

If you’re like me and have read almost every article on the topic of getting yourself out of a rut, you’ll notice the obvious things cropping up, those being:

Journaling always helped me through dark times before, but over time I've got out of the habit of it. I'm certain that part of feeling disconnected and lost is because of it's absence. Bringing back the daily practice is my first step. 

Daily journal prompts:

There are questions I’ll be asking myself each day during it, noting down the answers to:

 There are a few other things I’ve made an effort to do, such as:

 

Try out new hobbies to find things you enjoy. Enrol in new classes, meetup events or solo travel in the hopes that something will eventually bring joy through one of them! 

Volunteer your time for perspective. Helping others stops us overthinking about our own lives and forces us to gain empathy for someone else instead.

Dig deep and redefine goals. What do you want from life? Where do you see yourself in 5 or 10 years?

Identify your strengths and weaknesses. What things are you good at? What are you uniquely skilled at? What activities get you in a state of flow?

  

All feelings are. And even though we know it, we still make decisions that can sometimes be permanent. Instead, I’m making an effort to remind myself daily that this feeling is only a result of something happening in my life right now. These situations make us feel sad, frustrated or low… right now. They are only temporary. 

Most of us think that we’ll do something when we feel motivated. But the opposite is true. Taking action is what drives motivation, making us more motivated to do something. Get started and do something, right now, no matter how small. 

This is hard to do when you’re lacking motivation and feeling lost. After all, that lost feeling comes from not having goals or an idea of what you want in life. The way I’m combatting this is to set myself short-term goals. Goals that don’t need much concentration or effort but will make me feel better in the short-term. Hopefully the more we focus on the little things, the more chance we have of discovering the bigger goals that drive us.

Trying new things is hopeful. It gives you the chance to expand yourself and your goals. It might also lead to new opportunities that you haven't previously thought of. Some of those things you will love, others you won’t. But allow this bit to excite you.

Like I mentioned before, this feeling won’t last forever, but I understand that doesn’t help when you’re in the thick of these emotions. Have the courage to find a therapist and talk to someone, even if you only try it for a few weeks. Exploring ourselves on a deeper level is sometimes helped with someone there guiding you to open up and notice parts of you that you’ve suppressed.  

Ask yourself; ‘what would I do now if I felt motivated? How would I dress? What would I eat?’ The simple question of asking myself what I would do if I felt motivated right now, took me from working from home in my lounge wear, not doing a lot, to getting dressed, taking a walk and getting a lovely coffee from a local cafe. It was small but when I returned home I was in a different state of mind. 

 

Can you resonate with any of the above? If you feel the same, I hope these little starters help you to gain a little motivation. Do something small that makes you smile right now and seek the courage to make a change too. 

This article is a game-changer for anyone feeling lost or disconnected. It offers practical, actionable steps to rediscover yourself and reignite your passion for life. The advice on self-reflection, trying new experiences, and setting goals is spot-on. I especially appreciate the emphasis on self-compassion and patience. This is a must-read for anyone seeking to reconnect with their true self and find renewed purpose.

I appreciate this perspective and the vulnerability to talk about being lost.

I think this article is Very Inspiring, and I find the steps you’ve described to be a Motivational process I Excitedly want to try.

Not only do I usually feel lost and uninspired in life – Especially after serving 23 years in prison, and being psychologically evaluated and deemed to have Anxiety, Severe, Major Depression, and PTSD due to my past life and actions – but I have Absolutely No idea as to How on Earth I’m going to Get out of this Undesirable, Self Created reality and Do Something Fantastic with My Self and My Life.

Your Informative, well written article is an Attractive perspective and Amazing Opportunity I am curious to put into action just to see if it’ll bring me a positive, beneficial effect.

Versión en español | Versão em português

This podcast episode was originally released on 30 April, 2023.

Hello and welcome to Episode 177, and thanks so much for joining me as I talk about feeling lost and mental health!

I’m Jeremy Godwin and I share practical tips for improving your mental health based on quality research and my own personal experience of learning how to live with anxiety and depression following a breakdown in late 2011 that completely changed my life. Each week I look at how to improve one specific aspect of your wellbeing. 

In this episode I’ll be talking about what feeling lost means, why dealing with those feelings matters, and how to overcome feeling lost in life. So, let’s talk about feeling lost!

Introduction

A few years ago I found myself feeling completely lost for the second time in a decade — actually, the third, now I think about it — and it ended up changing my life for the better. But it took time. Let me explain. 

My first big ‘feeling lost’ period happened in 2010, when I found myself questioning why I was sticking with an employer who didn’t support me while I was dealing with a major issue at work, even though I’d been there for 9 years at the time. I didn’t know what I wanted to do, other than the fact that I knew I had to get out of that place, and that led me to jump at the first job opportunity that came my way… which ended up making my stress and anxiety much worse, because the job was very high-pressure and the company was so disorganised and erratic that it made it tough to get anything done, and so that ended up as one of several factors that led to my breakdown. 

Then my second ‘feeling lost’ period actually dragged on from 2012 to 2014, after I eventually quit that job because my mental health was so bad, but for most of that period I was severely depressed and highly medicated, so I definitely felt lost but I didn’t have a lot of time to think about what I wanted to do with my life because, well, frankly, I didn’t know that I wanted a life at that time. 

So then my third, and most significant, period of feeling lost came in 2018. I had graduated from university and now I had to decide what to do with myself… and I had absolutely no idea. Zero. I was going to keep on studying counselling but I struggled with the emotional side of it (funnily enough, that’s what I do now, working one-on-one with clients, but I’m in a much better headspace than I was back then). Anyway, then I actually enrolled into study again to become a primary school teacher, but that lasted two weeks when I realised that I just wasn’t going to have the patience necessary to deal with a bunch of kids and that I’d probably end up telling them off and traumatising them for life; I decided long ago not to repeat the damaged patterns of my own parents, which is why I don’t have children, so I thought it would be irresponsible to wind up doing that to someone else’s kids as a job (a choice that I wish some of my own childhood teachers had have made, because I had some really nasty ones!).

So here I was, about to turn 42 at the time, and still with no idea what I wanted to be when I grew up. What a mess! I ended up returning to the familiarity of the business world, and you may be aware that that little experiment didn’t end up lasting too long (I lasted just over a year), because it just wasn’t right for me either, but it’s the thing that led me to creating my podcast and to working for myself as a counsellor/coach, so it ended up being a very-necessary step on my path towards finding purpose and direction in my life.

Here’s the thing: often we can find ourselves feeling lost in life because we just don’t know where we’re heading, and why, and yet it’s the not knowing that actually presents a unique and exciting opportunity… because if you don’t have any preconceived ideas, that means you’re much more open to all of the possibilities that life has to offer you! I’ll talk about this idea in more detail shortly, but first let’s get ourselves on the same page with some definitions and let’s talk about…

What ‘feeling lost’ means

The idea of ‘feeling lost’ is a way to describe when someone feels unsure, mixed-up, or kind of overwhelmed by what’s happening in their life, their emotions, or their thoughts. It can show up in different ways like not knowing what steps to take next, not having a clear purpose, feeling disconnected from themselves or others, or having trouble making choices. 

You can feel lost in different parts of your life, such as in your relationships, at work, in terms of your personal growth, or just your overall path in life. 

Feeling lost is a common experience for a lot of people and it’s something that can happen as a result of different life events like dealing with major life changes, the ending of a relationship, the loss of a job, or having a general sense of dissatisfaction about where you’re at in your life in the present (especially if you had a very specific idea of where you wanted to be or thought you should be). It can often be accompanied by a lack of purpose or direction, a feeling like what you’re doing with yourself doesn’t have a lot of meaning, or general feelings of isolation or loneliness. 

The good news is that feeling lost is a temporary state, and so — with time, effort and perseverance — you can absolutely rediscover your sense of self and find happiness and meaning in your life again. 

It’s important to remember, however, that feeling lost is not a sign that something is wrong with you or that you’re a failure; feeling lost is a perfectly normal human emotion, and a lot of people go through it at various times in their lives. The key to dealing with it is figuring out what’s causing the feeling and dealing with that, as well as talking to friends, family, or even a mental health professional in order to get through the feeling, because it can be demoralising and demotivating.

As you may have noticed from the introduction earlier, I’m a bit of an optimist about the notion of feeling lost (well, a realistic optimist anyway), in the sense that I know from firsthand experience how unpleasant it can feel however I also know that it’s a wonderful opportunity to try new things and discover all of the possibilities that life has to offer; it can either feel like you’re wandering around with no idea what to do with yourself, or it can be a way of giving yourself permission to take your time and figure out what you might want to do with yourself… either way, the choice is yours (and it’s the choice you make that determines whether it’s an unpleasant experience or a much more pleasant one!). 

So now let’s talk about… 

Why dealing with those feelings matters

And it matters because (to state the obvious) feeling like you have no sense of purpose or direction in your life is very likely going to make you feel like complete and utter rubbish! There’s no way around this other than to say that feeling lost can be one of those ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’ things if you’re not careful, in the sense that you may feel a bit lost and then feeling that way can drag you slowly down into a pit of despair that makes you feel more and more lost, unless you deal with the reasons why you feel that way and put in the work to help yourself move forward.  

The thing is that feelings of being lost in life can have a significant impact on your mental health and overall wellbeing, and so it needs to be confronted and dealt with head-on; it’s very unlikely to magically fix itself, and honestly I don’t think it’s worth the risk to just wait and hope that things can only get better (and yes, I did just quote the 1993 song by British group D:Ream, because that’s what I do… you’re welcome!).

Back to the more serious conversation at hand… feeling lost can lead to a lack of motivation and direction which, over time, can lead to issues like anxiety, depression and hopelessness, along with general malaise and melancholy (or, if you’re a bit ‘emo’, an overwhelming desire to dress in black and sigh a lot while listening to The Cure). 

So, if you feel a bit lost (or a lot lost) and you want to be able to find a way forward, it’s about dealing with the reasons why you feel lost in the first place to then start looking at what your options are to move forward and create a sense of purpose, direction and fulfilment in your life.

How do you do that? Well that is a very good question, and coincidentally it just happens to be what I’m going to talk about next in the how-to part of today’s episode! So, let’s talk about… 

How to overcome feeling lost in life

And I’m going to start with one that will probably feel quite tough, and maybe even confronting, which is to acknowledge and accept the feeling of being lost — and I say that this one might be difficult because I think, for a lot of us, we put pressure on ourselves to focus on the positive all or most of the time, and so it can be genuinely confronting and uncomfortable to accept the fact that we feel anything less than the very best version of ourselves… but earlier I mentioned ‘realistic optimism’ (something I covered in Episode 47 about optimism) and the thing is that we all go through tough times every now and then (that’s the ‘realism’ part), and we are all completely capable of getting ourselves out of those tough times as well (which is the ‘optimism’ part). I’m going to sound like a cheesy bumper sticker or Instagram post here, but you have already survived 100% of your worst days so far in your life… so, whatever you’re going through now, you will survive this as well. But in order to heal, you first need to feel. So, be honest with yourself about what you’re feeling and why, and accept things as they are while also recognising that you have the ability to improve things (and I’ll tell you how to do that in a moment); you might find it helpful to write your feelings out, as it’s a great way to release your emotions, and just remember that emotions are better out than in! OK, next… 

Identify why you may feel lost — and this is all about self-awareness, which just so happens to be the foundation of all that is good and lovely when it comes to your wellbeing… because when you know yourself — really know yourself — you can make smarter choices for yourself based on who you are, who you are not, and what you actually need and want. So, to figure out why you might be feeling a bit lost it requires you to be honest with yourself about what’s going on in your life and what areas you might not be happy with. For example, take some time to think about recent changes in your life (such as the end of a relationship, a change of job, family issues, etc.) and how those changes might be impacting on your sense of purpose or direction. Think about what’s important to you in life and whether or not you’re living in alignment with your values and priorities. Reflect on your past experiences, both positive and negative, and consider how they might potentially be influencing your current state of mind. Think about the relationships in your life — family, friends, partner if you have one — and consider whether any of your relationships might be contributing to your feelings of being lost or disconnected. And then also pay attention to your emotions generally; take note of when you feel most lost or uncertain and what emotions you feel during those times, because that can provide you with quite a lot of insight into the underlying factors contributing to the feeling of being lost. The entire point of this exercise is to ask you to take some time to really think things through so that you can better know yourself, and so that you can really get your head around what you’re feeling and why (because, in the words of the ancient philosopher Socrates, “the unexamined life is not worth living”). I mentioned identifying your values before and I covered that in Episode 138, plus I talked about needs in Episode 137. Once you have a clearer picture of why you might be feeling a bit lost (or a lot), then move onto my next point which is… 

Create a plan — now you know what needs to be addressed, it’s time to start thinking about what you could possibly do about it! Depending on what your issues and challenges are, you’ll be able to find lots of different things that you could potentially do. For example, if the issue is boredom and feeling like you’re not being challenged, then maybe learning new skills would be a good way to overcome that… which then begs the question of what new skills?! So that would mean taking time to think about what interests you, as well as what your strengths are, so you can figure out ways to build your capability and knowledge (and I covered learning and capability in Episode 144). If the issue you’re dealing with is to do with your work, then the plan might be focused on finding a new job or maybe even changing career fields entirely. If you’re dealing with relationship issues, then maybe it’s about going to counselling or therapy with the other person (if they agree) to work through things together. If you feel lost because everything just feels a bit same-same, then you might want to focus on exploring your personal interests, trying new experiences, making time for self-care, getting out into nature, improving your self-compassion (which I explored in Episode 153) and more. Whatever the issues are, focus on them one by one and create a list of ideas for how you can tackle the issue, then pick a couple of things from that list that you feel positive and enthusiastic about and make a clear plan of what you’re going to do, when you’ll do it, and how you’ll know if it’s helping you make progress (and I talked about progress in Episode 161). OK, so once you have a plan then the next step is… 

Take action — because we can talk about the idea of doing all these things as much as we like, but it’s only by actually taking action and making things happen that you’re going to see any real results… so it’s time to do something about it! Allocate a little time every day to working on the issues that need to be addressed (and I encourage you to try at least a couple of things, for two reasons: it makes it more interesting if you mix it up, and it gives you a greater chance of success in case one of the things doesn’t pan out the way you might have hoped or expected). You don’t have to try and fix everything all at once; take things one day at a time and one step at a time, and remember that small steps add up over time to enormous progress (plus by not trying to rush yourself to quickly fix things, you actually are more likely of being successful in the long run because slowly changing things is more sustainable as it allows you to build and build over time). I also talked about this stuff recently in Episode 172 about feeling stuck, so you may find that helpful as well. 

OK, so that’s a more step-by-step process for you to consider, now I’m going to give you a bunch of general ideas of how to overcome that lost feeling; have a think about which ones might feel right for you and maybe give a couple a go, then try another couple later, and so on and so forth. OK, first…

Be creative — because engaging in creative activities like writing, painting, playing music, or other creative things can help you to explore your emotions and also gain greater awareness and insight into your inner self. Next… 

Connect with nature — want to feel part of something bigger? Then get outside and be part of something bigger! There is more nature than you can shake a stick at, and spending time doing things outdoors, like hiking or gardening, can help you to feel more grounded and more connected to the world around you. Next… 

Connect with your spirituality — which, again, is about feeling part of something bigger than just yourself because that can help you to find a sense of meaning and purpose; it doesn’t need to have anything to do with religion, but of course it can if that’s what feels right to you, and please bear in mind that ‘spirituality’ and ‘religion’ are two very different things (‘spirituality’ is about focusing on more than just the material and physical world, whereas ‘religion’ is about a specific belief system of faith and worship). OK, next… 

Practice mindfulness — because any kind of mindfulness practice, like meditation or yoga, can help you become more present and focused, which can help you to feel less anxious. I’ve said in many past episodes that I keep this really simple and just spend a few minutes a day with a coffee or tea, watching the clouds pass by; it’s a simple-yet-effective way to anchor myself in the present moment (plus I just happen to be really fascinated by the sky, day or night!). Next…

Change your environment — because sometimes a change of scenery can be exactly the type of change to help you gain perspective on other things in your life and find a new sense of direction. It’s why I go and work from a cafe every now and then, and it’s also why I like to go and spend a day at a museum or gallery sometimes to mix things up and get me out of my day-to-day. You could think about taking a trip somewhere, or if you’re feeling really adventurous then maybe you might want to look into moving to a new city or country; either way, experiencing new cultures and perspectives can broaden your horizons and provide new insights into your own life. OK, next…

Seek out role models or mentors — because finding someone who has been through a similar experience can be really helpful in gaining new insights and perspectives. Next… 

Read books or listen to podcasts — I mean, hey, it’s what you’re doing by listening to me now! Learning from others who have gone through a similar experience can be a source of inspiration and guidance, or maybe you just want to find new ideas for personal growth or perspectives that you hadn’t considered before. Next… 

Move your body — because exercise can help you feel more energised, reduce stress, and increase your sense of wellbeing. If you really want to have fun with it, you could move your body to Move That Body by 90’s band Technotronic, followed by Pump Up The Jam while using jam jars as hand weights, for the ultimate in exercise with a side-dish of meta! That’s a very specific, niche joke that I know I’ve made in an earlier episode and I enjoyed it so much that I’m recycling it here today and adding to it, because I believe in doing my bit for the environment and for reviving the career of obscure 90’s bands. [Laughs] I swear these jokes get dumber every week… you’re welcome! OK, so, moving on… 

Try new things — because just doing the same thing over and over again isn’t going to change anything, it is?! Try a new hobby, maybe join clubs or groups that align with your interests, volunteer your time and contribute to a cause you feel passionate about, try networking with industry groups or attend special interest events; there are lots of different things you can try and I’m sure you’ll find at least a few things that you might never have considered but which help you to feel stimulated and excited about new things. OK, next… 

Talk with a professional — if you’re struggling with persistent feelings of being lost or if you’re experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety, consider seeking help from a mental health professional; it’s one of those things that might feel really tough to talk about, but the more you talk about it the easier it gets over time. I can tell you from my own personal experience that it’s the best thing I ever did, and it played a huge role in helping me to get myself out of that ‘feeling lost’ headspace.

Summary and Close-Out

Because when it comes to feeling lost and mental health, what it all boils down to is this: Life can be a journey full of twists and turns and, at times, it’s easy to feel lost and uncertain about your direction. But remember that feeling lost sometimes is a normal part of life. It’s important to acknowledge those feelings and seek support from others while also focusing on looking after yourself, setting goals, and exploring new experiences. The good news is that feeling lost is actually an opportunity for personal growth and self-discovery; with time, effort, and perseverance, you can find your sense of purpose and direction in life. Keep moving forward, be patient and compassionate with yourself, and trust the journey. You are capable of finding your way and creating a fulfilling and meaningful life for yourself.

The choice is yours, as it is with all things related to your wellbeing… so, what choice will YOU make today? 

Each week I like to finish up by sharing a quote about the week’s topic, and I encourage you to take a few moments to really reflect on it and consider what it means to you. This week’s quote is by an unknown author, and it is:

“Feeling lost is part of the way.”

Alright… that’s nearly it for this week.

Next week I’ll be talking about closure. We all have to deal with issues and difficult times in life, whether that’s with relationships breaking down or being in challenging situations that leave us wondering what the hell just happened. The struggle tends to be afterwards, when we try to figure out how to move forward and keep on hitting walls because we haven’t been able to find any kind of closure or understanding about whatever happened or didn’t happen… and so that’s what I’m going to be talking about next week. I’ll be talking about what closure is (and what it isn’t), why closure isn’t guaranteed, and how to find closure for yourself.

# How to Develop Emotional Intelligence Skills | HBS Online

Stories designed to inspire future business leaders.

Harvard Business School Online's Business Insights Blog provides the career insights you need to achieve your goals and gain confidence in your business skills.

Emotional intelligence is a crucial component of leadership. Your ability to manage your emotions, as well as recognize and influence others’, has been considered one of the strongest indicators of workplace performance. Research shows that 90 percent of top performers are high in emotional intelligence.

Technical skills will only get you so far. If you’re an aspiring or current leader, you need to build your emotional intelligence to bring out the best in others and cultivate high-performing teams.

“Leaders prime the emotional state of the organization,” said Travis Bradberry, president of emotional intelligence provider TalentSmart, to the Society for Human Resource Management. “When they’re ineffective, when they set poor examples of how they treat other people, that trickles down throughout the company.”

Emotional intelligence, also known as emotional quotient or EQ, is the ability to understand and manage your emotions and the emotions of others. 

Similar to IQ, emotional intelligence can be measured through various assessments, but IQ represents cognitive abilities while EQ is a measure of one’s emotional capabilities. 

While emotional intelligence is beneficial for everyone, it’s especially important for those in leadership positions. Emotionally intelligent leaders can empathize with others, communicate effectively, and manage conflict. All of these abilities are qualities of effective leaders.

If you want to enhance your leadership capabilities, here are five emotional intelligence skills you need and ways you can develop them.

Self-awareness is having a clear understanding of your strengths, limitations, emotions, beliefs, and motivations. It sounds simple enough, yet 79 percent of executives surveyed by organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry had at least one blind spot—or a skill they ranked among their strongest that others reported as a weakness.

Leaders who are adept at recognizing and managing their emotions are better equipped to perceive others’ feelings and know how to motivate employees. Those who don’t could see a slip in performance: Research in the  Harvard Business Review found that teams with individuals who lack self-awareness make worse decisions and are less effective at conflict management.

By acknowledging your weaknesses, you can build trust and transparency among your team. You can also own your professional development by knowing the areas in which you need to improve in order to advance your career.

Self-regulation refers to how you manage your emotions, behaviors, and impulses. The more self-aware you are, the easier this becomes; if you can recognize what you’re feeling and why, you can respond appropriately.

“In my experience, I’ve never seen the tendency toward radical outbursts to surface as an indicator of strong leadership,” writes Daniel Goleman, the psychologist who popularized emotional intelligence, on his website.

If prone to emotional outbursts or overreacting, there are tactics you can use to improve your self-regulation, such as:

If you acknowledge your emotions and give yourself time to process them, you can carefully craft how you respond and avoid doing anything that could jeopardize the goodwill you’ve worked hard to build.

Empathy is the capability of understanding another person’s experiences and emotions, and has been ranked as the top leadership skill needed today by global consulting firm DDI. According to DDI's research, leaders who excel at listening and responding with empathy perform more than 40 percent higher in coaching, planning, and decision-making.

According to a separate survey by Businessolver, 96 percent of employees rank empathy as important, but 92 percent say it’s undervalued. It shouldn’t be, though: Companies that prioritize empathy experience an increase in revenue, retention, and productivity.

By actively listening to your employees and taking the time to understand their wants and needs, you can boost engagement, build trust, and more effectively coach them through challenges. The more your team feels appreciated, the more invested they’ll be, which, in turn, leads to higher morale and stronger company culture.

Motivation refers to your ability to inspire both yourself and others to action. Here, it’s essential to lead by example. Self-motivated leaders care more about hitting organizational milestones than monetary awards. They set goals, take initiative, rise to the challenge, and stay optimistic during turbulent times.

The more positive you are, the more confident your team will feel. Your intrinsic motivation will permeate the organization, and you’ll have a better understanding of how to empower employees.

Social skills are all about how you perceive emotions and interact and communicate with others. For example, emotionally intelligent leaders can walk into a room of employees with pursed lips and clenched fists and not only sense the tension, but know how to address and resolve the conflict before it escalates.

The more in tune you are with your emotions, the easier it will be to assess others’. And if you can assess others’ feelings, you can more easily build and maintain relationships. Leaders with strong social skills know they can’t achieve success alone. Surpassing goals and reaching milestones requires collaboration, communication, and a shared vision.

Related: How to Give Feedback Effectively

If you have gaps in your current skill set, there are actions you can take to boost your emotional intelligence. Methods include:

At the end of the workday, reflect on how your meetings, projects, and interactions went—whether positive or negative. By writing your thoughts down, you can spot specific patterns about your behaviors and reactions, as well as others’.

Where did you excel? How are your employees feeling? Are there certain people or situations that frustrated you and, if so, why? The more introspective you are, the better. For example, you’ll become more aware of what upsets you, so that you can avoid a future outburst, or mimic actions that have proven to boost employee morale.

In a 360-degree assessment, you solicit feedback from your manager, colleagues, and peers, while also undergoing an individual self-assessment. Through the process, you can gain valuable insights into what your co-workers perceive as your strengths and weaknesses, as well as uncover any blind spots you might have.

According to Jack Zenger, CEO of leadership development firm Zenger Folkman, more than 85 percent of all Fortune 500 companies use 360-degree feedback. It can help improve leaders’ self-awareness, which, in turn, can result in improved workplace effectiveness, less stress, and stronger relationships.

According to Psychology Today, only about 10 percent of people listen effectively. It’s easy to get distracted by technology, background noise, and your own thoughts. Yet, to be an effective communicator and emotionally intelligent leader, you need to be a good listener. 

To become more emotionally intelligent, practice active listening. Try to focus on what the speaker is saying and show that you’re engaged by paraphrasing and using other non-verbal cues like nodding. By actively listening at work, it will be easier to connect with others and truly understand their thoughts and feelings.

To understand the emotions of others, you need to understand your own first.

When you catch yourself feeling a particularly strong emotion, whether it’s a positive or negative one, make a conscious effort to think about what you’re feeling. Take a second and consider why you’re feeling this way and what might have triggered such a strong emotional response.

This will help you become more aware of your own emotions and better understand your colleagues’. As an empathetic leader, you’ll be able to cultivate a high-performing team.





If you’re interested in diving deeper into emotional intelligence and enhancing your leadership capabilities, taking an online leadership course or training could be the best next step.

Online courses offer working professionals the flexibility to complete coursework on their schedule and connect with a global community of like-minded peers, all while gaining new skills and knowledge.

One program to consider is Harvard Business School Online’s Leadership Principles course, which provides a 360-degree assessment to help you better understand who you are as a leader and how others perceive you.



Building your emotional intelligence skills can not only help you grow as a leader but enable you to motivate and coach teams more effectively. In turn, you can make a greater impact on your organization by boosting morale, productivity, and communication—enabling you to advance your business and career simultaneously.

          An overview of the importance of Emotional Intelligence for your own success and the success of your organization.
        

Blog

Today’s in-demand skills are increasingly technical in nature. However, there’s a corresponding need for the uniquely human ability to work with and through others to accomplish important goals.

Enter emotional intelligence (EI), a set of skills that help us recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions as well as recognize, understand and influence the emotions of others.

We recently spoke with Margaret Andrews, instructor of Emotional Intelligence in Leadership, about how people can build EI for better interpersonal relations. Andrews is the former associate dean at Harvard University’s Division of Continuing Education and executive director at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

“Emotional intelligence is critical in building and maintaining relationships and influencing others — key skills that help people throughout their career and wherever they sit in an organizational structure,” says Andrews.

Additionally, research suggests that people with a high emotional quotient (EQ) are more innovative and have higher job satisfaction than those with lower EQs.

Let’s dive into what exactly EI entails, and how you can improve on this essential component of successful relationships.

Emotional intelligence is a set of skills and behaviors. While some people will be naturally more adept at certain aspects, EI can be learned, developed, and enhanced.

The four main components of EI are self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness, and social skills:

Self-awareness is the ability to identify and understand your own emotions and the impact we have on others. It’s the cornerstone of emotional intelligence and the other components of EI depend on this self-awareness.

“It all starts with self-awareness, which is foundation of EI, and it builds from there. If you’re aware of your own emotions and the behaviors they trigger, you can begin to manage these emotions and behaviors,” says Andrews.

Our emotions impact our mood, behaviors, performance, and interactions with other people. “We are all having emotions all the time,” says Andrews, “the question is whether you are aware of these emotions and the impact they have on your behavior — and other people.”

According to Tasha Eurich, an organizational psychologist, researcher, and author of Insight, people who are self-aware tend to be more confident and more creative. They also make better decisions, build stronger relationships, and communicate more effectively.

Self-awareness opens the door to self-regulation, which is the ability to manage these emotions and behaviors. Once we’re aware of our emotions, we can begin to manage them and keep the disruptive emotions and impulses under control.

“People with strong self-regulation can pause and take a deep breath in tense and stressful situations, explains Andrews, “which helps them remain calm and think before they speak or act.”

These people tend toward a positive outlook and are adaptable to a variety of situations and circumstances. “On the flip side,” she says, “those that cannot contain their negative emotions and impulses often set off a chain reaction of negative emotions in others.”

“There’s an old adage that people join organizations and leave managers,” says Andrews, “and it’s true. So, companies — or managers — that have high turnover rates should take a look in the mirror.”

Social awareness is our ability to understand the emotions of others and a key component of this is empathy.

Jamil Zaki, a Stanford professor and author of The War for Kindness, describes empathy as having three components — identifying what others feel, sharing this emotion, and wishing to improve their experience.

“It’s not about how you would feel in their situation, but rather, how they actually feel,” says Andrews.

People with strong social awareness tend toward kindness. However, this doesn’t mean they cannot give others difficult feedback — in fact, they may be better at delivering this ‘tough love’ because they understand the other person and want to help them improve.

“Social skills are what separate a great manager from a good one,” says Andrews.

These skills, which include influence, conflict management, teamwork, and the ability to inspire others, make it possible to build and maintain healthy relationships in all parts of your life.

People with strong social skills can make an enormous difference on a team and in organizations because they understand others and act on this knowledge to move people toward a common goal.

To improve your emotional intelligence, you need to start at the beginning, with self-awareness. However, gauging your self-awareness is innately difficult because, as Andrews puts it, “you don’t know what you don’t know.”

Without an objective sense of who you are and what drives you, it’s nearly impossible to be emotionally intelligent. Andrews cites a study by Tasha Eurich which found that 95 percent of participants gave themselves high marks in self-awareness.

However, using more empirical measures of self-awareness, the study found that only 10-15 percent of the cohort was truly self-aware.

That’s a pretty big gap, and one that suggests most of us aren’t very self-aware. What’s worse, research also shows that managers and CEOs may be the least self-aware of all. This is not despite their authority, but quite possibly because of it.

Eurich wrote in the Harvard Business Review that the more power someone obtains, the more likely they are to be overconfident about how well they know themselves. After all, those at the top of the chain have fewer people giving them feedback.

Often, when managers do receive feedback from employees, it isn’t as honest as it might be because subordinates are afraid of incurring negative consequences. Managers are insulated from criticism, and as a result, self-awareness sinks.

Receiving honest, constructive feedback is key to becoming self-aware. Andrews notes that a 360-degree emotional intelligence assessment can be a very effective way to gain insight into your EI-components and the impact you have on others.

“Many people shrug off differences in how they rate themselves versus how others rate them on EI competencies by saying that they’re too hard on themselves or that others don’t really understand their intent,” says Andrews, “but really it shows a lack of self-awareness.”

Emotional intelligence is a set of skills and behaviors that can be learned and developed. Here are some telltale signs of people with low EQ and those with high EQ.

People with low EQ:

People with high EQ:

Developing emotional intelligence is an ongoing process. The journey differs from person to person. Nonetheless, according to Andrews, the following actions may lead you to better self-awareness, empathy, and social skills.

What emotions are you feeling right now? Can you name them? When in a stressful situation, what emotions typically arise? How would you like to respond in these situations? Can you stop to pause and reconsider your response? Taking a moment to name your feelings and temper your reactivity is an integral step toward EI.

Audit your self-perception by asking managers, colleagues, friends, or family how they would rate your emotional intelligence. For example, ask them about how you respond to difficult situations, how adaptable or empathetic you are, and/or how well you handle conflict. It may not always be what you want to hear, but it will often be what you need to hear.

Studies show that reading literature with complex characters can improve empathy. Reading stories from other people’s perspectives helps us gain insight into their thoughts, motivations, and actions and may help enhance your social awareness.

Building E.I. in yourself is one thing, but influencing others to adopt a more empathetic mindset can be a challenge. To create a culture of high EQ, managers and supervisors must model emotionally intelligent behavior.

“If you want to change how your organization does in EI, you can set norms for how people communicate and how they disagree,” says Andrews.

In addition, you need to recognize and celebrate those that exhibit emotional intelligence.;

“Start making heroes of people who help other people,” says Andrews. “It’s not just the person who got to the top of the mountain first — it’s all the people who helped them. If you want to encourage good team behavior, recognize it, and call it out for what it is.”

        Emotional Intelligence


Emotional intelligence fuels your performance both in the workplace and in your personal life, but it starts with you. From your confidence, empathy and optimism to your social skills and self-control, understanding and managing your own emotions can accelerate success in all areas of your life.

No matter what professional field you are in, whether you manage a team of two or 20, or even just yourself, realising how effective you are at controlling your own emotional energy is a great starting point. Absent from the curriculum, emotional intelligence isn’t something we are taught or tested on, so where did it come from, what is it, do you have it and is it really that important?

Fortunately, it is something you can learn and we’ve compiled a comprehensive list of tips to help you explore your own level of emotional intelligence and gain important emotional intelligence skills that can be implemented into everyday life. Some of these tips we follow ourselves and others have been revealed to us by our amazing clients and partners who know how to motivate and inspire their teams but first and foremost, themselves.

1. Emotional Intelligence2. Self-awareness3. Self-management4. Motivation5. Empathy6. Social skills7. What to avoid

 

Put simply, Emotional Intelligence is how well individuals identify and manage their own emotions and react to the emotions of others. It’s understanding how those emotions shape your thoughts and actions so you can have greater control over your behaviour and develop the skills to manage yourself more effectively. Becoming more emotionally conscious allows us to grow and gain a deeper understanding of who we are, enabling us to communicate better with others and build stronger relationships.

We suggest starting with these initial 8 tips, they provide a good starting point to discovering the foundations of your emotional intelligence.

#1) Practice observing how you feelOften we lead hectic, busy lifestyles and it’s all too easy for us to lose touch with our emotions. To reconnect, try setting a timer for various points during the day. When the timer goes off, take a few deep breaths and notice how you’re feeling emotionally. Pay attention to where that emotion is showing up as a physical feeling in your body and what the sensation feels like. The more you practice, the more it will become second nature.

#2) Pay attention to how you behaveWhile you’re practising your emotional awareness, take the time to notice your behaviour too. Observe how you act when you’re experiencing certain emotions, and how that affects your day-to-day life. Managing our emotions becomes easier once we become more conscious of how we react to them.

#3) Question your own opinionsIn this hyper-connected world, it is easy to fall into an ‘opinion bubble’. This is a state of existence where your own opinions are constantly re-enforced by people with similar viewpoints. Take time to read the other side of the story and have your views challenged (even if you still feel they are right). This will help you understand other people and be more receptive to new ideas.

#4) Take responsibility for your feelingsYour emotions and behaviour come from you, they don’t come from anyone else and once you start accepting responsibility for how you feel and how you behave it will have a positive impact on all areas of your life.



#5) Take time to celebrate the positiveA key part emotional intelligence is celebrating and reflecting on the positive moments in life. People who experience positive emotions are generally more resilient and more likely to have fulfilling relationships, which will help them move past adversity.

#6) But don’t ignore the negative

Reflecting on negative feelings is just as important as reflecting on the positive. Understanding why you feel negative is key to becoming a fully-rounded individual, who is more able to deal with negative issues in the future.

#7) Don’t forget to breathe

Life throws various situations our way, with most of us experiencing some sort of stress on a regular basis. To manage your emotions when this happens and to avoid outbursts, don’t forget to breathe. Call a time out and go put some cold water on your face, go outside and get some fresh air or make a drink – anything to keep your cool and give yourself a chance to get a hold on what’s happening and how you should respond.

#8) A lifetime processUnderstand and remember that emotional intelligence is something you develop and requires continual improvement; it’s very much a lifetime practice.

A key component of emotional intelligence, self-awareness is the ability to recognise and understand your own character, moods and emotions and their effect on others. It includes a realistic self-assessment of what you’re capable of – your strengths and weaknesses – and knowing how others perceive you. It can help highlight areas for self-improvement, make you better at adapting and can limit wrongful decisions.

#9) Learn to look at yourself objectivelyKnowing yourself completely is difficult and it’s almost impossible to look at yourself objectively, so input from those who know you is vital. Ask them where your strengths and weaknesses lie, write down what they say and compare it. Look out for any patterns and remember not to argue with them – it doesn’t mean they’re right – they’re just trying to help you gauge your perception from another’s point of view.

#10) Keep a diaryA great way to get an accurate gauge of yourself is to keep a diary. Start by writing down what happened to you at the end of every day, how it made you feel and how you dealt with it. Documenting details like these will make you more aware of what you’re doing and will highlight where problems might be coming from. Periodically, look back over your comments and take note of any trends.

#11) Understand what motivates youEveryone has a core motivation when they begin a project. The difficulty is keeping this driving force in mind when adversity appears. All too often people start a project but fail to complete it because they lose their motivation to do so. Take time to understand what motivates you and use it to push you across the finish line.

#12) Take it easy

Sometimes emotional outbreaks occur because we don’t take the time out to slow down and process how we’re feeling. Give yourself a break and make a conscious effort to meditate, do yoga or read – a little escapism works wonders. And then the next time you have an emotional reaction to something, try to pause before you react.

#13) Acknowledge your emotional triggers

Self-aware individuals are able to recognise their emotions as they occur. It’s important to be flexible with your emotions and adapt them to your situation. Don’t deny your emotions stage time but don’t be rigid with them either, take the time to process your emotions before communicating them.

#14) Predict how you will feelThink about a situation you’re going into and predict how you will feel. Practice naming and accepting the feelings – naming the feeling puts you in control. Try to choose an appropriate reaction to the feeling rather than just reacting to it.



#15) Trust your intuitionIf you are still unsure about which path to take, trust your intuition. After all, your subconscious has been learning which path to take throughout your entire life.

Once you’ve gotten to grips with self-awareness and how your emotions work, you can get a handle on self-management. Which means taking responsibility for your own behaviour and well-being as well as controlling emotional outbursts.

#16) Snap out of itOne key way to keep your emotions in check is to change your sensory input – motion dictates emotion as the old saying goes. So jolt your physical body out of routine by attending an exercise class or try channelling a busy mind with a puzzle or a book – anything to break your existing routine.

#17) Maintain a schedule (and stick to it!)Ensuring that you create a schedule and stick to it is extremely important if you want to complete tasks effectively.

Paul Minors of Productivityist writes “When you schedule appointments in your calendar, you’re saying to yourself: “I’m going to do A, B and C by X date and it’s going to take Y hours. Once you make this promise, it becomes harder to procrastinate.”

#18) Eat well

This sounds like an easy one but regulating what you eat and drink can have a massive effect on your emotional state, so try your best to maintain a balanced diet.

#19) Don’t get mad

Funnel your emotional energy into something productive. It’s okay to keep overwhelming emotions inside, especially if it’s not an appropriate time to let them out. However, when you do, rather than vent it on something futile, turn it into motivation instead. Don’t get mad, get better.

#20) Be interestedA key factor in managing yourself and your emotions is consciously taken the time to be interested in the subject matter, whether it be business or personal.

#21) Don’t expect people to trust you (if you can’t trust them)

Establishing trust with a person can be difficult, and once it’s lost it’s very hard to regain. Try to be mindful that people are only human and will make mistakes. By offering your trust, you are inviting people to offer their trust in return.

#22) It’s your choiceYou have the ability to choose how you react to a situation – you can either overreact or remain calm. But it’s your choice.

A personal skills aspect of emotional intelligence, self-motivation refers to our inner drive to achieve and improve our commitment to our goals, our readiness to act on opportunities and our overall optimism.

#23) Personal goalsPersonal goals can provide long-term direction and short-term motivation. So grab a pen and paper and have a think about where you want to be and set some targets for yourself. Base them on your strengths and make them relevant to you and ultimately, make them exciting and achievable. This task alone is enough to get you instantly motivated!

#24) Be realisticWhen you’ve set a new goal, be sure to give yourself realistic and clear aims to achieving that goal and understand that change is an inevitable part of life. Achievement boosts confidence and as self-confidence rises so does the ability to achieve more, see how it works?

#25) Positive thinkingTo keep motivated it’s important to maintain a positive and optimistic mindset. See problems and setbacks as learning opportunities instead of failings and try to avoid negative people and opt to surround yourself with positive, well-motivated people – they’ll have a great effect on you.



#26) Lifelong learningBoth knowledge and information are key for feeding your mind and keeping you curious and motivated. And with information so easily accessible, you have the opportunity to fuel your values and passions at the click of a button!

#27) Be prepared to leave your comfort zoneThe biggest barrier to achieving your full potential is not challenging yourself frequently enough. Great things can happen to you if you’re willing to leave your comfort zone, so do so as often as you can.

#28) Help

Don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it, and vice versa. If others need help, don’t hold back in giving it to them. Seeing other people succeed will only help to motivate yourself.

#29) Stand and stretchFor an instant short term boost to your motivation, take a stand and stretch out as far as you can for 10 seconds. When you return to your desk, you’ll be in the correct frame of mind and ready to work.

Quite simply, empathy is the ability to understand other people’s emotions. Understanding that everyone has their own set of feelings, desires, triggers and fears. To be empathetic you’re allowing their experiences to resonate with your own in order to respond in an emotionally appropriate way. It’s a lifelong skill and the most important one for navigating relationships, and whilst it may not come naturally, there are a few ways it can be nurtured.

#30) Listen

Before you’re able to empathise with someone you first need to understand what it is they’re saying, which means listening is at the very epicentre of empathy. It involves letting them talk without interruption, preconceptions, scepticism and putting your own issues on pause to allow yourself to absorb their situation and consider how they are feeling before you react.

#31) Try to be approachableWhether you’re the leader of a team or working on a project with others, try to remain accessible and approachable.

#32) PerspectiveWe’re all familiar with the phrase “put yourself in their shoes”, and this is exactly that. The simplest way of gaining a little perspective the next time an issue or situation arises is to switch places with the other person and really think about what’s happening from their point of view. Sometimes there’s no right or wrong but at least you’ll understand enough to come to a resolve or offer some useful advice.

#33) Open yourself upOne of the quickest ways to offer a sincere exchange or sign of empathy is to listen to someone’s experiences and connect to it with a similar experience of your own. Don’t be afraid to open yourself up, it might just be the start of a great and lasting friendship.



#34) Immerse yourself in a new cultureThe old saying ‘travel broadens the mind’ is still true, even in this ever shrinking world. Sometimes the best way to open your mind is to jump on a plane and go somewhere completely different.

#35) Cultivate a curiosity about strangers

Highly empathetic people have an insatiable curiosity about strangers. When we talk to people outside of our usual social circle we learn about and begin to understand opinions, views and lives that are different to our own. So next time you’re sat on a bus you know just what to do…

#36) Acknowledge what people are sayingAnother useful tip is, whilst listening to what a person has to say, use acknowledgement words such as ‘I understand’ and ‘I see’ to show a person you’re listening (but of course only say these things if you are actually listening!).

In emotional intelligence terms, social skills refer to the skills needed to handle and influence other people’s emotions effectively. It covers a wide range of abilities, from communication and conflict management to dealing with change, meeting new people and building relationships and plays a part in almost every part of our lives, from work life to our romantic life. It’s complex and requires utilising almost every point we have already mentioned, but here are a few pointers for you.

#37) Get startedA good way to get started on improving your social skills is to isolate one skill you know you’d like to develop, this narrows it down and gives you focus. Internationally known psychologist, Daniel Goleman, suggests highlighting someone you know to be good at that particular skill, observing how they act and how they control their emotions and then implementing and applying that knowledge to yourself.

#38) Wear somebody else’s shoesNot literally of course! Everyone has heard the phrase ‘walk a mile in somebody else’s shoes’, but how many people actually practice this advice? Give it a try, you never know.

#39) Practice makes perfectThe idea of practising your social skills might sound strange, but like everything in life, practice makes perfect.

#40) Social media cold turkeyWe don’t mean to sound old, but taking your social life offline and engaging face-to-face with people will open up so many opportunities for you to gain and develop your social skills. So next time instead of instant messaging your best friend, meet up for a drink! Emotional intelligence doesn’t expand within the confines of (un) social media…

#41) Get networkingA good way to practise your social acumen is to attend local networking events. The great thing about these events is that everyone attending has a shared reason for attending.

#42) It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it

We’re talking about the importance of nonverbal communication and how that can affect a person’s opinion of you. Body language, tone of voice and eye contact is key to letting others know how you feel emotionally. So once you’ve got your emotions intact, think about how you’re physically coming across.

#43) The unknownThe ultimate method to building your social skills is to get out there and be sociable. It sounds simple, but you can’t strengthen your social skills without being social! Join a group or network outside of your usual circle; it’s the perfect way to put all of our tips into play.

Those with a high EQ very rarely display the following traits, something for you to be mindful of.

#44) DramaEmotionally intelligent people listen, offer sound advice and extend empathy to those who need it but they don’t permit others’ lives and emotions to effect or rule their own.

#45) ComplainingComplaining implies two things – one, that we are victims, and two, that there are no solutions to our problems. Rarely does an emotionally intelligent person feel victimised, and even more infrequently do they feel that a solution is beyond their grasp. So instead of looking for someone or something to blame, they think constructively and dissolve the solution in private.



#46) NegativityEmotionally intelligent people have the ability to kerb cynical thoughts. They acknowledge that negative thoughts are just that – thoughts – and rely on facts to come to conclusions as well as being able to silence or zone out any negativity.

#47) Dwelling on the pastThose with high emotional intelligence choose to learn from the mistakes and choices they have made and instead of dwelling on the past are mindful to live in the now.

#48) SelfishnessWhilst a degree of selfishness is required to get ahead in life, too much can fracture relationships and cause disharmony. Try to avoid being overly selfish and consider others needs.

#49) Giving in to peer pressureJust because everyone else does something, they don’t feel compelled to follow suit if they don’t want to. They think independently, and never conform just to please other people.

#50) Being overly criticalNothing destroys a person’s morale faster than being overly critical. Remember that people are only human and have the same motivations (and limitations) as you. Take the time to understand another person then communicate the change you want to see.

By understanding and successfully applying emotional intelligence, you too can reach your full potential and achieve your goals.

Harvard Business School Online's Business Insights Blog provides the career insights you need to achieve your goals and gain confidence in your business skills.

Emotional intelligence is a crucial component of leadership. Your ability to manage your emotions, as well as recognize and influence others’, has been considered one of the strongest indicators of workplace performance. Research shows that 90 percent of top performers are high in emotional intelligence.

Technical skills will only get you so far. If you’re an aspiring or current leader, you need to build your emotional intelligence to bring out the best in others and cultivate high-performing teams.

“Leaders prime the emotional state of the organization,” said Travis Bradberry, president of emotional intelligence provider TalentSmart, to the Society for Human Resource Management. “When they’re ineffective, when they set poor examples of how they treat other people, that trickles down throughout the company.”

Emotional intelligence, also known as emotional quotient or EQ, is the ability to understand and manage your emotions and the emotions of others. 

Similar to IQ, emotional intelligence can be measured through various assessments, but IQ represents cognitive abilities while EQ is a measure of one’s emotional capabilities. 

While emotional intelligence is beneficial for everyone, it’s especially important for those in leadership positions. Emotionally intelligent leaders can empathize with others, communicate effectively, and manage conflict. All of these abilities are qualities of effective leaders.

If you want to enhance your leadership capabilities, here are five emotional intelligence skills you need and ways you can develop them.

Access your free e-book today.

Self-awareness is having a clear understanding of your strengths, limitations, emotions, beliefs, and motivations. It sounds simple enough, yet 79 percent of executives surveyed by organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry had at least one blind spot—or a skill they ranked among their strongest that others reported as a weakness.

Leaders who are adept at recognizing and managing their emotions are better equipped to perceive others’ feelings and know how to motivate employees. Those who don’t could see a slip in performance: Research in the  Harvard Business Review found that teams with individuals who lack self-awareness make worse decisions and are less effective at conflict management.

By acknowledging your weaknesses, you can build trust and transparency among your team. You can also own your professional development by knowing the areas in which you need to improve in order to advance your career.

Self-regulation refers to how you manage your emotions, behaviors, and impulses. The more self-aware you are, the easier this becomes; if you can recognize what you’re feeling and why, you can respond appropriately.

“In my experience, I’ve never seen the tendency toward radical outbursts to surface as an indicator of strong leadership,” writes Daniel Goleman, the psychologist who popularized emotional intelligence, on his website.

If prone to emotional outbursts or overreacting, there are tactics you can use to improve your self-regulation, such as:

If you acknowledge your emotions and give yourself time to process them, you can carefully craft how you respond and avoid doing anything that could jeopardize the goodwill you’ve worked hard to build.

Empathy is the capability of understanding another person’s experiences and emotions, and has been ranked as the top leadership skill needed today by global consulting firm DDI. According to DDI's research, leaders who excel at listening and responding with empathy perform more than 40 percent higher in coaching, planning, and decision-making.

According to a separate survey by Businessolver, 96 percent of employees rank empathy as important, but 92 percent say it’s undervalued. It shouldn’t be, though: Companies that prioritize empathy experience an increase in revenue, retention, and productivity.

By actively listening to your employees and taking the time to understand their wants and needs, you can boost engagement, build trust, and more effectively coach them through challenges. The more your team feels appreciated, the more invested they’ll be, which, in turn, leads to higher morale and stronger company culture.

Motivation refers to your ability to inspire both yourself and others to action. Here, it’s essential to lead by example. Self-motivated leaders care more about hitting organizational milestones than monetary awards. They set goals, take initiative, rise to the challenge, and stay optimistic during turbulent times.

The more positive you are, the more confident your team will feel. Your intrinsic motivation will permeate the organization, and you’ll have a better understanding of how to empower employees.

Social skills are all about how you perceive emotions and interact and communicate with others. For example, emotionally intelligent leaders can walk into a room of employees with pursed lips and clenched fists and not only sense the tension, but know how to address and resolve the conflict before it escalates.

The more in tune you are with your emotions, the easier it will be to assess others’. And if you can assess others’ feelings, you can more easily build and maintain relationships. Leaders with strong social skills know they can’t achieve success alone. Surpassing goals and reaching milestones requires collaboration, communication, and a shared vision.

Related: How to Give Feedback Effectively

If you have gaps in your current skill set, there are actions you can take to boost your emotional intelligence. Methods include:

At the end of the workday, reflect on how your meetings, projects, and interactions went—whether positive or negative. By writing your thoughts down, you can spot specific patterns about your behaviors and reactions, as well as others’.

Where did you excel? How are your employees feeling? Are there certain people or situations that frustrated you and, if so, why? The more introspective you are, the better. For example, you’ll become more aware of what upsets you, so that you can avoid a future outburst, or mimic actions that have proven to boost employee morale.

In a 360-degree assessment, you solicit feedback from your manager, colleagues, and peers, while also undergoing an individual self-assessment. Through the process, you can gain valuable insights into what your co-workers perceive as your strengths and weaknesses, as well as uncover any blind spots you might have.

According to Jack Zenger, CEO of leadership development firm Zenger Folkman, more than 85 percent of all Fortune 500 companies use 360-degree feedback. It can help improve leaders’ self-awareness, which, in turn, can result in improved workplace effectiveness, less stress, and stronger relationships.

According to Psychology Today, only about 10 percent of people listen effectively. It’s easy to get distracted by technology, background noise, and your own thoughts. Yet, to be an effective communicator and emotionally intelligent leader, you need to be a good listener. 

To become more emotionally intelligent, practice active listening. Try to focus on what the speaker is saying and show that you’re engaged by paraphrasing and using other non-verbal cues like nodding. By actively listening at work, it will be easier to connect with others and truly understand their thoughts and feelings.

To understand the emotions of others, you need to understand your own first.

When you catch yourself feeling a particularly strong emotion, whether it’s a positive or negative one, make a conscious effort to think about what you’re feeling. Take a second and consider why you’re feeling this way and what might have triggered such a strong emotional response.

This will help you become more aware of your own emotions and better understand your colleagues’. As an empathetic leader, you’ll be able to cultivate a high-performing team.





If you’re interested in diving deeper into emotional intelligence and enhancing your leadership capabilities, taking an online leadership course or training could be the best next step.

Online courses offer working professionals the flexibility to complete coursework on their schedule and connect with a global community of like-minded peers, all while gaining new skills and knowledge.

One program to consider is Harvard Business School Online’s Leadership Principles course, which provides a 360-degree assessment to help you better understand who you are as a leader and how others perceive you.



Building your emotional intelligence skills can not only help you grow as a leader but enable you to motivate and coach teams more effectively.

          An overview of the importance of Emotional Intelligence for your own success and the success of your organization.
        

Blog

Today’s in-demand skills are increasingly technical in nature. However, there’s a corresponding need for the uniquely human ability to work with and through others to accomplish important goals.

Enter emotional intelligence (EI), a set of skills that help us recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions as well as recognize, understand and influence the emotions of others.

We recently spoke with Margaret Andrews, instructor of Emotional Intelligence in Leadership, about how people can build EI for better interpersonal relations. Andrews is the former associate dean at Harvard University’s Division of Continuing Education and executive director at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

“Emotional intelligence is critical in building and maintaining relationships and influencing others — key skills that help people throughout their career and wherever they sit in an organizational structure,” says Andrews.

Additionally, research suggests that people with a high emotional quotient (EQ) are more innovative and have higher job satisfaction than those with lower EQs.

Let’s dive into what exactly EI entails, and how you can improve on this essential component of successful relationships.

Emotional intelligence is a set of skills and behaviors. While some people will be naturally more adept at certain aspects, EI can be learned, developed, and enhanced.

The four main components of EI are self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness, and social skills:

Self-awareness is the ability to identify and understand your own emotions and the impact we have on others. It’s the cornerstone of emotional intelligence and the other components of EI depend on this self-awareness.

“It all starts with self-awareness, which is foundation of EI, and it builds from there. If you’re aware of your own emotions and the behaviors they trigger, you can begin to manage these emotions and behaviors,” says Andrews.

Our emotions impact our mood, behaviors, performance, and interactions with other people. “We are all having emotions all the time,” says Andrews, “the question is whether you are aware of these emotions and the impact they have on your behavior — and other people.”

According to Tasha Eurich, an organizational psychologist, researcher, and author of Insight, people who are self-aware tend to be more confident and more creative. They also make better decisions, build stronger relationships, and communicate more effectively.

Self-awareness opens the door to self-regulation, which is the ability to manage these emotions and behaviors. Once we’re aware of our emotions, we can begin to manage them and keep the disruptive emotions and impulses under control.

“People with strong self-regulation can pause and take a deep breath in tense and stressful situations, explains Andrews, “which helps them remain calm and think before they speak or act.”

These people tend toward a positive outlook and are adaptable to a variety of situations and circumstances. “On the flip side,” she says, “those that cannot contain their negative emotions and impulses often set off a chain reaction of negative emotions in others.”

“There’s an old adage that people join organizations and leave managers,” says Andrews, “and it’s true. So, companies — or managers — that have high turnover rates should take a look in the mirror.”

Social awareness is our ability to understand the emotions of others and a key component of this is empathy.

Jamil Zaki, a Stanford professor and author of The War for Kindness, describes empathy as having three components — identifying what others feel, sharing this emotion, and wishing to improve their experience.

“It’s not about how you would feel in their situation, but rather, how they actually feel,” says Andrews.

People with strong social awareness tend toward kindness. However, this doesn’t mean they cannot give others difficult feedback — in fact, they may be better at delivering this ‘tough love’ because they understand the other person and want to help them improve.

“Social skills are what separate a great manager from a good one,” says Andrews.

These skills, which include influence, conflict management, teamwork, and the ability to inspire others, make it possible to build and maintain healthy relationships in all parts of your life.

People with strong social skills can make an enormous difference on a team and in organizations because they understand others and act on this knowledge to move people toward a common goal.

To improve your emotional intelligence, you need to start at the beginning, with self-awareness. However, gauging your self-awareness is innately difficult because, as Andrews puts it, “you don’t know what you don’t know.”

Without an objective sense of who you are and what drives you, it’s nearly impossible to be emotionally intelligent. Andrews cites a study by Tasha Eurich which found that 95 percent of participants gave themselves high marks in self-awareness.

However, using more empirical measures of self-awareness, the study found that only 10-15 percent of the cohort was truly self-aware.

That’s a pretty big gap, and one that suggests most of us aren’t very self-aware. What’s worse, research also shows that managers and CEOs may be the least self-aware of all. This is not despite their authority, but quite possibly because of it.

Eurich wrote in the Harvard Business Review that the more power someone obtains, the more likely they are to be overconfident about how well they know themselves. After all, those at the top of the chain have fewer people giving them feedback.

Often, when managers do receive feedback from employees, it isn’t as honest as it might be because subordinates are afraid of incurring negative consequences. Managers are insulated from criticism, and as a result, self-awareness sinks.

Receiving honest, constructive feedback is key to becoming self-aware. Andrews notes that a 360-degree emotional intelligence assessment can be a very effective way to gain insight into your EI-components and the impact you have on others.

“Many people shrug off differences in how they rate themselves versus how others rate them on EI competencies by saying that they’re too hard on themselves or that others don’t really understand their intent,” says Andrews, “but really it shows a lack of self-awareness.”

Emotional intelligence is a set of skills and behaviors that can be learned and developed. Here are some telltale signs of people with low EQ and those with high EQ.

People with low EQ:

People with high EQ:

Developing emotional intelligence is an ongoing process. The journey differs from person to person. Nonetheless, according to Andrews, the following actions may lead you to better self-awareness, empathy, and social skills.

What emotions are you feeling right now? Can you name them? When in a stressful situation, what emotions typically arise? How would you like to respond in these situations? Can you stop to pause and reconsider your response? Taking a moment to name your feelings and temper your reactivity is an integral step toward EI.

Audit your self-perception by asking managers, colleagues, friends, or family how they would rate your emotional intelligence. For example, ask them about how you respond to difficult situations, how adaptable or empathetic you are, and/or how well you handle conflict. It may not always be what you want to hear, but it will often be what you need to hear.

Studies show that reading literature with complex characters can improve empathy. Reading stories from other people’s perspectives helps us gain insight into their thoughts, motivations, and actions and may help enhance your social awareness.

Building E.I. in yourself is one thing, but influencing others to adopt a more empathetic mindset can be a challenge. To create a culture of high EQ, managers and supervisors must model emotionally intelligent behavior.

“If you want to change how your organization does in EI, you can set norms for how people communicate and how they disagree,” says Andrews.

In addition, you need to recognize and celebrate those that exhibit emotional intelligence.;

“Start making heroes of people who help other people,” says Andrews. “It’s not just the person who got to the top of the mountain first — it’s all the people who helped them. If you want to encourage good team behavior, recognize it, and call it out for what it is.”

Learn about our Editorial Process

Emotional intelligence (EI or EQ) is the ability to identify and regulate our own emotions as well as recognize, understand, and engage with the emotions of others (Goleman, 1996). 

It is a critical skill to build stronger and empathetic relationships, and it helps connect with our deepest feelings, allowing us to make decisions that are more aligned with our values and personal goals. 

Emotional intelligence is a flexible skill that can be learned. 

Even though some individuals might naturally be more emotionally intelligent than others, high EI can be developed with time through regular practice.

Below are some ways which may help to increase emotional intelligence.

Active listening is about hearing beyond people’s words. It involves fully attuning to what is being communicated, including the content of the message and the attitude that underlies it (Rogers and Farson, 1957). 

Paying attention to another’s body language, as well as the tone and speed of their voice, can help identify the speaker’s emotional state in that moment and any messages beyond what they are saying. 

To practice active listening, it is important to let the other person’s train of thought flow without interruptions, as this will facilitate open communication and create a climate of trust and acceptance. 

Secondly, controlling external and internal distractions can help facilitate active listening. In particular, the internal chatter in our minds and the need to plan our responses will allow us to be fully present in the moment and sharpen our listening skills (Lunenburg, 2010).   

When experiencing uncomfortable emotions, we might have the tendency to ignore them or bottle them up rather than accept them as a normal and sometimes useful part of our life.

Leaning into our uncomfortable emotions can give us the opportunity to deal with our feelings productively, increasing our self-awareness and ability to introduce positive changes in our lives (Bradberry and Greaves, 2009). 

By exploring with curiosity our full range of emotions, we can gain a more objective view of the person we are and how our feelings are influencing our actions. To see things from a wider perspective, we can also open up to feedback from others, asking about specific situations where we acted with poor emotional awareness.

Learning to label emotions with more specific vocabulary can help identify more precisely the type of emotional state we are experiencing and feel more in control of our responses (David, 2016). 

Beyond the six core emotions – happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise – there is a vast spectrum that can be explored through the emotions wheel (Figure 2). 

By recognizing, for example, that sadness differs from boredom or a sense of loneliness; we can become better able to pinpoint our emotions and manage them effectively. 

An additional strategy to develop emotional awareness might be keeping a diary, where we write a description of our emotions and how these are brought up by specific circumstances. 

After a few weeks, we may begin to see patterns. We may come to understand which emotions are most difficult for us to tolerate, which ones are triggering, and which ones contribute to feeling more connected with our own values and satisfaction with our lives.

Knowing what situations are triggering is critical for developing the ability to manage our emotional reactions and maintain calm. 

We can use a diary to also identify the sources of stress or write down a list that includes a) specific situations – when we are most likely to feel frightened, disempowered, or not in control b) people – for example, those who appear to be toxic, friends not respecting boundaries or work colleagues trying to impose their opinions c) conditions in the environment – such as crowded or noisy places. 

This will help us anticipate our stressors and then think about ways to put in place strategies to handle our emotions more appropriately (Bradberry and Greaves, 2009).  

Once we develop greater openness towards our emotions, it is also important to learn how to use them to our advantage rather than letting them control us. 

The first step is to avoid judging our emotions and labeling them as good or bad. Instead, we should recognize them as powerful sources of information which can be used to drive our actions toward what matters to us (Bradberry and Greaves, 2009). 

Refocusing our attention on things that are under our control and can be improved also allows us to not feel trapped in a downward emotional spiral and engage in more committed actions. 

To give our minds a break, we should also prioritize scheduling activities in our routines that make us feel mentally recharged. These may include exercise, yoga, meditation, or other relaxing activities for the mind.

Developing emotional competencies is not only important at the personal level. 

Encouraging emotional intelligence in others, including children, students, romantic partners, and work teams, can help increase sensitivity to emotional cues that are often missed within oneself and the environment and ultimately boost the quality of interpersonal relationships (Nagarjuna Nagar, 2020). 

There are a few tips we can follow to enhance EI in others:

Creating opportunities to share opinions can help build trust in both dyadic and group interactions, reinforcing the importance of self-expression and promoting transparent communication between individuals. 

For example, in a work setting, we might start by asking our team how they are feeling about a particular decision rather than appointing a quick solution to a problem without explaining the rationale behind it. 

We might also try to engage in conversations by asking our co-workers about things that disappoint them at work, what motivates them the most, and how they deal with emotional stress related to work.

To encourage self-expression in others, such as in children, we might ask them to name an emotion matching their present state. If they find this exercise difficult or give flat answers like “I feel fine/good,” we can ask them to rate an emotion on a 1-10 scale or make use of the emotions wheel.

For example, you could ask: ‘How worried do you feel on a scale of 1-10?’

This technique can even work for adults who may struggle with identifying their emotions. 

It may be useful to give some constructive feedback to others about situations where they acted with poor emotional awareness. 

Did they not show enough care or support to people who needed their help? Did they say something that could be perceived as disrespectful or inconsiderate of others’ feelings? Are they often adopting unclear or inconsistent communication of tasks? 

Ensure this feedback is not confrontational or using blaming language but expressed in a kind manner so as to encourage open, healthy discussion. 

Encouraging cooperation within groups facilitates sharing of objectives, values, and concerns, which can ultimately result in an increased sense of group identity and commitment to tasks. 

To enhance a team’s EI, we can highlight participants’ strengths and weaknesses, build a team spirit to spark passion and motivation and constantly provide a space to reflect on personal progress and ways to improve existing skills.

“What really matters for success, character, happiness and life long achievements is a definite set of emotional skills – your EQ — not just purely cognitive abilities that are measured by conventional IQ tests.”

In accordance with Goleman’s statement, emotional intelligence can benefit our personal and professional life in several ways. 

It is a valuable tool to utilize when handling unpredictable and emotionally charged situations, it promotes better clarity of our motivations and goals, and it is an integral part of developing more satisfying relationships with others. 

EI is also a significant predictor of professional success, believed to account for 58% of performance in all types of jobs (Bradberry and Greaves, 2006).

Overall, EI has been found to subsume a variety of skills that are critical in our day-to-day life (Figure 1).

Increased sensitivity to the feelings of others allows more effective communication and prevents the escalation of tension and conflicts. 

As we are more aware of the emotional needs of the people we interact with, we are more likely to adopt a collaborative attitude and be open to compromise (Petrovici and Dobrescu, 2014).

Recognizing how specific situations can trigger stressful emotions can help us feel more in control of our reactions, replacing negative feelings with appropriate coping skills to deal with them. 

Neglecting how emotional stress drives our behaviors can lead to irrational decisions and ultimately exacerbate mental health outcomes (Ciarrochi, Deane, and Anderson, 2002).

Understanding how emotions influence our thoughts can prevent us from making misguided decisions, both in our personal lives and in the workplace. 

As we are able to identify emotions that are superfluous or unrelated to a problem, we can form more objective judgments and enhance the quality of decision-making (Hess and Bacigalupo, 2011).

Changes in our personal and professional life are constant and can sometimes be emotionally intense. 

Reflecting on the emotional reactions that make us resistant to change as well as the interpretations and preconceptions associated with them, can help us assume a more positive outlook and think more optimistically about opportunities that can derive from change (Lin et al., 2016).

With high EI, we can better understand the meaning of our aspirations and the motivational skills required to achieve goals in relation to our work, personal life, and health (Magnano, Craparo, and Paolillo, 2016). 

In addition, with the capacity to recognize emotions, we can also impact other people’s motivations, encouraging positive attitudes towards shared goals when working in teams.

Since EI is a skill that can be continuously developed and refined over time, it makes sense that our ability to deal with emotional challenges might increase with age. 

Indeed, research suggests that older adults are better able to balance emotions and cognition when problem-solving and making decisions compared to their younger counterparts. 

In addition, older adults seem to be better able to regulate emotions and minimize the intensity and duration of negative affect (Carstensen et al., 2000). 

At the same time, it is important to acknowledge that a person’s age does not always mirror their level of emotional maturity, and some EI competencies might require more consistent practice and training (Fariselli, Ghini, and Freedman, 2008).

Low EI manifests with difficulty dealing with our own feelings and relating to the emotional experiences of others (Goleman, 1996). 

Being emotionally disconnected may result in uncontrolled and impulsive behaviors, such as emotional outbursts, insensitive responses, or blaming others, all of which can compromise the quality of our relationships. 

Ignoring other people’s feelings can also increase the risk of conflicts if the conversations are too closed, self-centered and foster misunderstandings (Hansen, 2015). 

Ultimately, low EI may result in a reduction of a person’s social circle and level of emotional support, with detrimental effects on mental health and well-being.

Though IQ and EI are sometimes related, they represent two separate constructs that might present with different levels of development in the same person. 

Having a strong ability to analyze and interpret situations (often associated with a high IQ) does not necessarily translate into the ability to read other people’s emotions or attend to emotional cues. 

Similarly, the ability to find rational solutions to problems might not manifest in social situations where strong EI skills are needed to manage conflict and reach a compromise (Goleman, 2020).

Considering the increasingly important role of EI in academic and work success, as well as in managing stress and life transitions, there is a growing interest in teaching emotional intelligence to teenagers and students. 

In a classroom environment, incorporating training focused on enhancing assertive communication and managing negative self-talk can result in an improvement in EI skills (Chang, 2006). 

In addition, students who show the greatest benefit from EI programs are also more likely to persist with their studies in the future (Qualter et al., 2009). 

In practice, introducing behaviors in classrooms that are informed by EI principles, such as promoting collaboration between students and practicing self-reflection exercises, can help students gradually assimilate this skill.

# How to Develop Emotional Intelligence Skills | HBS Online

Stories designed to inspire future business leaders.

Harvard Business School Online's Business Insights Blog provides the career insights you need to achieve your goals and gain confidence in your business skills.

Emotional intelligence is a crucial component of leadership. Your ability to manage your emotions, as well as recognize and influence others’, has been considered one of the strongest indicators of workplace performance. Research shows that 90 percent of top performers are high in emotional intelligence.

Technical skills will only get you so far. If you’re an aspiring or current leader, you need to build your emotional intelligence to bring out the best in others and cultivate high-performing teams.

“Leaders prime the emotional state of the organization,” said Travis Bradberry, president of emotional intelligence provider TalentSmart, to the Society for Human Resource Management. “When they’re ineffective, when they set poor examples of how they treat other people, that trickles down throughout the company.”

Emotional intelligence, also known as emotional quotient or EQ, is the ability to understand and manage your emotions and the emotions of others. 

Similar to IQ, emotional intelligence can be measured through various assessments, but IQ represents cognitive abilities while EQ is a measure of one’s emotional capabilities. 

While emotional intelligence is beneficial for everyone, it’s especially important for those in leadership positions. Emotionally intelligent leaders can empathize with others, communicate effectively, and manage conflict. All of these abilities are qualities of effective leaders.

If you want to enhance your leadership capabilities, here are five emotional intelligence skills you need and ways you can develop them.

Access your free e-book today.

Self-awareness is having a clear understanding of your strengths, limitations, emotions, beliefs, and motivations. It sounds simple enough, yet 79 percent of executives surveyed by organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry had at least one blind spot—or a skill they ranked among their strongest that others reported as a weakness.

Leaders who are adept at recognizing and managing their emotions are better equipped to perceive others’ feelings and know how to motivate employees. Those who don’t could see a slip in performance: Research in the  Harvard Business Review found that teams with individuals who lack self-awareness make worse decisions and are less effective at conflict management.

By acknowledging your weaknesses, you can build trust and transparency among your team. You can also own your professional development by knowing the areas in which you need to improve in order to advance your career.

Self-regulation refers to how you manage your emotions, behaviors, and impulses. The more self-aware you are, the easier this becomes; if you can recognize what you’re feeling and why, you can respond appropriately.

“In my experience, I’ve never seen the tendency toward radical outbursts to surface as an indicator of strong leadership,” writes Daniel Goleman, the psychologist who popularized emotional intelligence, on his website.

If prone to emotional outbursts or overreacting, there are tactics you can use to improve your self-regulation, such as:

If you acknowledge your emotions and give yourself time to process them, you can carefully craft how you respond and avoid doing anything that could jeopardize the goodwill you’ve worked hard to build.

Empathy is the capability of understanding another person’s experiences and emotions, and has been ranked as the top leadership skill needed today by global consulting firm DDI. According to DDI's research, leaders who excel at listening and responding with empathy perform more than 40 percent higher in coaching, planning, and decision-making.

According to a separate survey by Businessolver, 96 percent of employees rank empathy as important, but 92 percent say it’s undervalued. It shouldn’t be, though: Companies that prioritize empathy experience an increase in revenue, retention, and productivity.

By actively listening to your employees and taking the time to understand their wants and needs, you can boost engagement, build trust, and more effectively coach them through challenges. The more your team feels appreciated, the more invested they’ll be, which, in turn, leads to higher morale and stronger company culture.

Motivation refers to your ability to inspire both yourself and others to action. Here, it’s essential to lead by example. Self-motivated leaders care more about hitting organizational milestones than monetary awards. They set goals, take initiative, rise to the challenge, and stay optimistic during turbulent times.

The more positive you are, the more confident your team will feel. Your intrinsic motivation will permeate the organization, and you’ll have a better understanding of how to empower employees.

Social skills are all about how you perceive emotions and interact and communicate with others. For example, emotionally intelligent leaders can walk into a room of employees with pursed lips and clenched fists and not only sense the tension, but know how to address and resolve the conflict before it escalates.

The more in tune you are with your emotions, the easier it will be to assess others’. And if you can assess others’ feelings, you can more easily build and maintain relationships. Leaders with strong social skills know they can’t achieve success alone. Surpassing goals and reaching milestones requires collaboration, communication, and a shared vision.

Related: How to Give Feedback Effectively

If you have gaps in your current skill set, there are actions you can take to boost your emotional intelligence. Methods include:

At the end of the workday, reflect on how your meetings, projects, and interactions went—whether positive or negative. By writing your thoughts down, you can spot specific patterns about your behaviors and reactions, as well as others’.

Where did you excel? How are your employees feeling? Are there certain people or situations that frustrated you and, if so, why? The more introspective you are, the better. For example, you’ll become more aware of what upsets you, so that you can avoid a future outburst, or mimic actions that have proven to boost employee morale.

In a 360-degree assessment, you solicit feedback from your manager, colleagues, and peers, while also undergoing an individual self-assessment. Through the process, you can gain valuable insights into what your co-workers perceive as your strengths and weaknesses, as well as uncover any blind spots you might have.

According to Jack Zenger, CEO of leadership development firm Zenger Folkman, more than 85 percent of all Fortune 500 companies use 360-degree feedback. It can help improve leaders’ self-awareness, which, in turn, can result in improved workplace effectiveness, less stress, and stronger relationships.

According to Psychology Today, only about 10 percent of people listen effectively. It’s easy to get distracted by technology, background noise, and your own thoughts. Yet, to be an effective communicator and emotionally intelligent leader, you need to be a good listener. 

To become more emotionally intelligent, practice active listening. Try to focus on what the speaker is saying and show that you’re engaged by paraphrasing and using other non-verbal cues like nodding. By actively listening at work, it will be easier to connect with others and truly understand their thoughts and feelings.

To understand the emotions of others, you need to understand your own first.

When you catch yourself feeling a particularly strong emotion, whether it’s a positive or negative one, make a conscious effort to think about what you’re feeling. Take a second and consider why you’re feeling this way and what might have triggered such a strong emotional response.

This will help you become more aware of your own emotions and better understand your colleagues’. As an empathetic leader, you’ll be able to cultivate a high-performing team.





If you’re interested in diving deeper into emotional intelligence and enhancing your leadership capabilities, taking an online leadership course or training could be the best next step.

Online courses offer working professionals the flexibility to complete coursework on their schedule and connect with a global community of like-minded peers, all while gaining new skills and knowledge.

One program to consider is Harvard Business School Online’s Leadership Principles course, which provides a 360-degree assessment to help you better understand who you are as a leader and how others perceive you.



Building your emotional intelligence skills can not only help you grow as a leader but enable you to motivate and coach teams more effectively. In turn, you can make a greater impact on your organization by boosting morale, productivity, and communication—enabling you to advance your business and career simultaneously.

        Emotional Intelligence


Emotional intelligence fuels your performance both in the workplace and in your personal life, but it starts with you. From your confidence, empathy and optimism to your social skills and self-control, understanding and managing your own emotions can accelerate success in all areas of your life.

No matter what professional field you are in, whether you manage a team of two or 20, or even just yourself, realising how effective you are at controlling your own emotional energy is a great starting point. Absent from the curriculum, emotional intelligence isn’t something we are taught or tested on, so where did it come from, what is it, do you have it and is it really that important?

Fortunately, it is something you can learn and we’ve compiled a comprehensive list of tips to help you explore your own level of emotional intelligence and gain important emotional intelligence skills that can be implemented into everyday life. Some of these tips we follow ourselves and others have been revealed to us by our amazing clients and partners who know how to motivate and inspire their teams but first and foremost, themselves.

1. Emotional Intelligence2. Self-awareness3. Self-management4. Motivation5. Empathy6. Social skills7. What to avoid

 

Put simply, Emotional Intelligence is how well individuals identify and manage their own emotions and react to the emotions of others. It’s understanding how those emotions shape your thoughts and actions so you can have greater control over your behaviour and develop the skills to manage yourself more effectively. Becoming more emotionally conscious allows us to grow and gain a deeper understanding of who we are, enabling us to communicate better with others and build stronger relationships.

We suggest starting with these initial 8 tips, they provide a good starting point to discovering the foundations of your emotional intelligence.

#1) Practice observing how you feelOften we lead hectic, busy lifestyles and it’s all too easy for us to lose touch with our emotions. To reconnect, try setting a timer for various points during the day. When the timer goes off, take a few deep breaths and notice how you’re feeling emotionally. Pay attention to where that emotion is showing up as a physical feeling in your body and what the sensation feels like. The more you practice, the more it will become second nature.

#2) Pay attention to how you behaveWhile you’re practising your emotional awareness, take the time to notice your behaviour too. Observe how you act when you’re experiencing certain emotions, and how that affects your day-to-day life. Managing our emotions becomes easier once we become more conscious of how we react to them.

#3) Question your own opinionsIn this hyper-connected world, it is easy to fall into an ‘opinion bubble’. This is a state of existence where your own opinions are constantly re-enforced by people with similar viewpoints. Take time to read the other side of the story and have your views challenged (even if you still feel they are right). This will help you understand other people and be more receptive to new ideas.

#4) Take responsibility for your feelingsYour emotions and behaviour come from you, they don’t come from anyone else and once you start accepting responsibility for how you feel and how you behave it will have a positive impact on all areas of your life.



#5) Take time to celebrate the positiveA key part emotional intelligence is celebrating and reflecting on the positive moments in life. People who experience positive emotions are generally more resilient and more likely to have fulfilling relationships, which will help them move past adversity.

#6) But don’t ignore the negative

Reflecting on negative feelings is just as important as reflecting on the positive. Understanding why you feel negative is key to becoming a fully-rounded individual, who is more able to deal with negative issues in the future.

#7) Don’t forget to breathe

Life throws various situations our way, with most of us experiencing some sort of stress on a regular basis. To manage your emotions when this happens and to avoid outbursts, don’t forget to breathe. Call a time out and go put some cold water on your face, go outside and get some fresh air or make a drink – anything to keep your cool and give yourself a chance to get a hold on what’s happening and how you should respond.

#8) A lifetime processUnderstand and remember that emotional intelligence is something you develop and requires continual improvement; it’s very much a lifetime practice.

A key component of emotional intelligence, self-awareness is the ability to recognise and understand your own character, moods and emotions and their effect on others. It includes a realistic self-assessment of what you’re capable of – your strengths and weaknesses – and knowing how others perceive you. It can help highlight areas for self-improvement, make you better at adapting and can limit wrongful decisions.

#9) Learn to look at yourself objectivelyKnowing yourself completely is difficult and it’s almost impossible to look at yourself objectively, so input from those who know you is vital. Ask them where your strengths and weaknesses lie, write down what they say and compare it. Look out for any patterns and remember not to argue with them – it doesn’t mean they’re right – they’re just trying to help you gauge your perception from another’s point of view.

#10) Keep a diaryA great way to get an accurate gauge of yourself is to keep a diary. Start by writing down what happened to you at the end of every day, how it made you feel and how you dealt with it. Documenting details like these will make you more aware of what you’re doing and will highlight where problems might be coming from. Periodically, look back over your comments and take note of any trends.

#11) Understand what motivates youEveryone has a core motivation when they begin a project. The difficulty is keeping this driving force in mind when adversity appears. All too often people start a project but fail to complete it because they lose their motivation to do so. Take time to understand what motivates you and use it to push you across the finish line.

#12) Take it easy

Sometimes emotional outbreaks occur because we don’t take the time out to slow down and process how we’re feeling. Give yourself a break and make a conscious effort to meditate, do yoga or read – a little escapism works wonders. And then the next time you have an emotional reaction to something, try to pause before you react.

#13) Acknowledge your emotional triggers

Self-aware individuals are able to recognise their emotions as they occur. It’s important to be flexible with your emotions and adapt them to your situation. Don’t deny your emotions stage time but don’t be rigid with them either, take the time to process your emotions before communicating them.

#14) Predict how you will feelThink about a situation you’re going into and predict how you will feel. Practice naming and accepting the feelings – naming the feeling puts you in control. Try to choose an appropriate reaction to the feeling rather than just reacting to it.



#15) Trust your intuitionIf you are still unsure about which path to take, trust your intuition. After all, your subconscious has been learning which path to take throughout your entire life.

Once you’ve gotten to grips with self-awareness and how your emotions work, you can get a handle on self-management. Which means taking responsibility for your own behaviour and well-being as well as controlling emotional outbursts.

#16) Snap out of itOne key way to keep your emotions in check is to change your sensory input – motion dictates emotion as the old saying goes. So jolt your physical body out of routine by attending an exercise class or try channelling a busy mind with a puzzle or a book – anything to break your existing routine.

#17) Maintain a schedule (and stick to it!)Ensuring that you create a schedule and stick to it is extremely important if you want to complete tasks effectively.

Paul Minors of Productivityist writes “When you schedule appointments in your calendar, you’re saying to yourself: “I’m going to do A, B and C by X date and it’s going to take Y hours. Once you make this promise, it becomes harder to procrastinate.”

#18) Eat well

This sounds like an easy one but regulating what you eat and drink can have a massive effect on your emotional state, so try your best to maintain a balanced diet.

#19) Don’t get mad

Funnel your emotional energy into something productive. It’s okay to keep overwhelming emotions inside, especially if it’s not an appropriate time to let them out. However, when you do, rather than vent it on something futile, turn it into motivation instead. Don’t get mad, get better.

#20) Be interestedA key factor in managing yourself and your emotions is consciously taken the time to be interested in the subject matter, whether it be business or personal.

#21) Don’t expect people to trust you (if you can’t trust them)

Establishing trust with a person can be difficult, and once it’s lost it’s very hard to regain. Try to be mindful that people are only human and will make mistakes. By offering your trust, you are inviting people to offer their trust in return.

#22) It’s your choiceYou have the ability to choose how you react to a situation – you can either overreact or remain calm. But it’s your choice.

A personal skills aspect of emotional intelligence, self-motivation refers to our inner drive to achieve and improve our commitment to our goals, our readiness to act on opportunities and our overall optimism.

#23) Personal goalsPersonal goals can provide long-term direction and short-term motivation. So grab a pen and paper and have a think about where you want to be and set some targets for yourself. Base them on your strengths and make them relevant to you and ultimately, make them exciting and achievable. This task alone is enough to get you instantly motivated!

#24) Be realisticWhen you’ve set a new goal, be sure to give yourself realistic and clear aims to achieving that goal and understand that change is an inevitable part of life. Achievement boosts confidence and as self-confidence rises so does the ability to achieve more, see how it works?

#25) Positive thinkingTo keep motivated it’s important to maintain a positive and optimistic mindset. See problems and setbacks as learning opportunities instead of failings and try to avoid negative people and opt to surround yourself with positive, well-motivated people – they’ll have a great effect on you.



#26) Lifelong learningBoth knowledge and information are key for feeding your mind and keeping you curious and motivated. And with information so easily accessible, you have the opportunity to fuel your values and passions at the click of a button!

#27) Be prepared to leave your comfort zoneThe biggest barrier to achieving your full potential is not challenging yourself frequently enough. Great things can happen to you if you’re willing to leave your comfort zone, so do so as often as you can.

#28) Help

Don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it, and vice versa. If others need help, don’t hold back in giving it to them. Seeing other people succeed will only help to motivate yourself.

#29) Stand and stretchFor an instant short term boost to your motivation, take a stand and stretch out as far as you can for 10 seconds. When you return to your desk, you’ll be in the correct frame of mind and ready to work.

Quite simply, empathy is the ability to understand other people’s emotions. Understanding that everyone has their own set of feelings, desires, triggers and fears. To be empathetic you’re allowing their experiences to resonate with your own in order to respond in an emotionally appropriate way. It’s a lifelong skill and the most important one for navigating relationships, and whilst it may not come naturally, there are a few ways it can be nurtured.

#30) Listen

Before you’re able to empathise with someone you first need to understand what it is they’re saying, which means listening is at the very epicentre of empathy. It involves letting them talk without interruption, preconceptions, scepticism and putting your own issues on pause to allow yourself to absorb their situation and consider how they are feeling before you react.

#31) Try to be approachableWhether you’re the leader of a team or working on a project with others, try to remain accessible and approachable.

#32) PerspectiveWe’re all familiar with the phrase “put yourself in their shoes”, and this is exactly that. The simplest way of gaining a little perspective the next time an issue or situation arises is to switch places with the other person and really think about what’s happening from their point of view. Sometimes there’s no right or wrong but at least you’ll understand enough to come to a resolve or offer some useful advice.

#33) Open yourself upOne of the quickest ways to offer a sincere exchange or sign of empathy is to listen to someone’s experiences and connect to it with a similar experience of your own. Don’t be afraid to open yourself up, it might just be the start of a great and lasting friendship.



#34) Immerse yourself in a new cultureThe old saying ‘travel broadens the mind’ is still true, even in this ever shrinking world. Sometimes the best way to open your mind is to jump on a plane and go somewhere completely different.

#35) Cultivate a curiosity about strangers

Highly empathetic people have an insatiable curiosity about strangers. When we talk to people outside of our usual social circle we learn about and begin to understand opinions, views and lives that are different to our own. So next time you’re sat on a bus you know just what to do…

#36) Acknowledge what people are sayingAnother useful tip is, whilst listening to what a person has to say, use acknowledgement words such as ‘I understand’ and ‘I see’ to show a person you’re listening (but of course only say these things if you are actually listening!).

In emotional intelligence terms, social skills refer to the skills needed to handle and influence other people’s emotions effectively. It covers a wide range of abilities, from communication and conflict management to dealing with change, meeting new people and building relationships and plays a part in almost every part of our lives, from work life to our romantic life. It’s complex and requires utilising almost every point we have already mentioned, but here are a few pointers for you.

#37) Get startedA good way to get started on improving your social skills is to isolate one skill you know you’d like to develop, this narrows it down and gives you focus. Internationally known psychologist, Daniel Goleman, suggests highlighting someone you know to be good at that particular skill, observing how they act and how they control their emotions and then implementing and applying that knowledge to yourself.

#38) Wear somebody else’s shoesNot literally of course! Everyone has heard the phrase ‘walk a mile in somebody else’s shoes’, but how many people actually practice this advice? Give it a try, you never know.

#39) Practice makes perfectThe idea of practising your social skills might sound strange, but like everything in life, practice makes perfect.

#40) Social media cold turkeyWe don’t mean to sound old, but taking your social life offline and engaging face-to-face with people will open up so many opportunities for you to gain and develop your social skills. So next time instead of instant messaging your best friend, meet up for a drink! Emotional intelligence doesn’t expand within the confines of (un) social media…

#41) Get networkingA good way to practise your social acumen is to attend local networking events. The great thing about these events is that everyone attending has a shared reason for attending.

#42) It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it

We’re talking about the importance of nonverbal communication and how that can affect a person’s opinion of you. Body language, tone of voice and eye contact is key to letting others know how you feel emotionally. So once you’ve got your emotions intact, think about how you’re physically coming across.

#43) The unknownThe ultimate method to building your social skills is to get out there and be sociable. It sounds simple, but you can’t strengthen your social skills without being social! Join a group or network outside of your usual circle; it’s the perfect way to put all of our tips into play.

Those with a high EQ very rarely display the following traits, something for you to be mindful of.

#44) DramaEmotionally intelligent people listen, offer sound advice and extend empathy to those who need it but they don’t permit others’ lives and emotions to effect or rule their own.

#45) ComplainingComplaining implies two things – one, that we are victims, and two, that there are no solutions to our problems. Rarely does an emotionally intelligent person feel victimised, and even more infrequently do they feel that a solution is beyond their grasp. So instead of looking for someone or something to blame, they think constructively and dissolve the solution in private.



#46) NegativityEmotionally intelligent people have the ability to kerb cynical thoughts. They acknowledge that negative thoughts are just that – thoughts – and rely on facts to come to conclusions as well as being able to silence or zone out any negativity.

#47) Dwelling on the pastThose with high emotional intelligence choose to learn from the mistakes and choices they have made and instead of dwelling on the past are mindful to live in the now.

#48) SelfishnessWhilst a degree of selfishness is required to get ahead in life, too much can fracture relationships and cause disharmony. Try to avoid being overly selfish and consider others needs.

#49) Giving in to peer pressureJust because everyone else does something, they don’t feel compelled to follow suit if they don’t want to. They think independently, and never conform just to please other people.

#50) Being overly criticalNothing destroys a person’s morale faster than being overly critical. Remember that people are only human and have the same motivations (and limitations) as you. Take the time to understand another person then communicate the change you want to see.

By understanding and successfully applying emotional intelligence, you too can reach your full potential and achieve your goals.

Learn about our Editorial Process

Emotional intelligence (EI or EQ) is the ability to identify and regulate our own emotions as well as recognize, understand, and engage with the emotions of others (Goleman, 1996). 

It is a critical skill to build stronger and empathetic relationships, and it helps connect with our deepest feelings, allowing us to make decisions that are more aligned with our values and personal goals. 

Emotional intelligence is a flexible skill that can be learned. 

Even though some individuals might naturally be more emotionally intelligent than others, high EI can be developed with time through regular practice.

Below are some ways which may help to increase emotional intelligence.

Active listening is about hearing beyond people’s words. It involves fully attuning to what is being communicated, including the content of the message and the attitude that underlies it (Rogers and Farson, 1957). 

Paying attention to another’s body language, as well as the tone and speed of their voice, can help identify the speaker’s emotional state in that moment and any messages beyond what they are saying. 

To practice active listening, it is important to let the other person’s train of thought flow without interruptions, as this will facilitate open communication and create a climate of trust and acceptance. 

Secondly, controlling external and internal distractions can help facilitate active listening. In particular, the internal chatter in our minds and the need to plan our responses will allow us to be fully present in the moment and sharpen our listening skills (Lunenburg, 2010).   

When experiencing uncomfortable emotions, we might have the tendency to ignore them or bottle them up rather than accept them as a normal and sometimes useful part of our life.

Leaning into our uncomfortable emotions can give us the opportunity to deal with our feelings productively, increasing our self-awareness and ability to introduce positive changes in our lives (Bradberry and Greaves, 2009). 

By exploring with curiosity our full range of emotions, we can gain a more objective view of the person we are and how our feelings are influencing our actions. To see things from a wider perspective, we can also open up to feedback from others, asking about specific situations where we acted with poor emotional awareness.

Learning to label emotions with more specific vocabulary can help identify more precisely the type of emotional state we are experiencing and feel more in control of our responses (David, 2016). 

Beyond the six core emotions – happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise – there is a vast spectrum that can be explored through the emotions wheel (Figure 2). 

By recognizing, for example, that sadness differs from boredom or a sense of loneliness; we can become better able to pinpoint our emotions and manage them effectively. 

An additional strategy to develop emotional awareness might be keeping a diary, where we write a description of our emotions and how these are brought up by specific circumstances. 

After a few weeks, we may begin to see patterns. We may come to understand which emotions are most difficult for us to tolerate, which ones are triggering, and which ones contribute to feeling more connected with our own values and satisfaction with our lives.

Knowing what situations are triggering is critical for developing the ability to manage our emotional reactions and maintain calm. 

We can use a diary to also identify the sources of stress or write down a list that includes a) specific situations – when we are most likely to feel frightened, disempowered, or not in control b) people – for example, those who appear to be toxic, friends not respecting boundaries or work colleagues trying to impose their opinions c) conditions in the environment – such as crowded or noisy places. 

This will help us anticipate our stressors and then think about ways to put in place strategies to handle our emotions more appropriately (Bradberry and Greaves, 2009).  

Once we develop greater openness towards our emotions, it is also important to learn how to use them to our advantage rather than letting them control us. 

The first step is to avoid judging our emotions and labeling them as good or bad. Instead, we should recognize them as powerful sources of information which can be used to drive our actions toward what matters to us (Bradberry and Greaves, 2009). 

Refocusing our attention on things that are under our control and can be improved also allows us to not feel trapped in a downward emotional spiral and engage in more committed actions. 

To give our minds a break, we should also prioritize scheduling activities in our routines that make us feel mentally recharged. These may include exercise, yoga, meditation, or other relaxing activities for the mind.

Developing emotional competencies is not only important at the personal level. 

Encouraging emotional intelligence in others, including children, students, romantic partners, and work teams, can help increase sensitivity to emotional cues that are often missed within oneself and the environment and ultimately boost the quality of interpersonal relationships (Nagarjuna Nagar, 2020). 

There are a few tips we can follow to enhance EI in others:

Creating opportunities to share opinions can help build trust in both dyadic and group interactions, reinforcing the importance of self-expression and promoting transparent communication between individuals. 

For example, in a work setting, we might start by asking our team how they are feeling about a particular decision rather than appointing a quick solution to a problem without explaining the rationale behind it. 

We might also try to engage in conversations by asking our co-workers about things that disappoint them at work, what motivates them the most, and how they deal with emotional stress related to work.

To encourage self-expression in others, such as in children, we might ask them to name an emotion matching their present state. If they find this exercise difficult or give flat answers like “I feel fine/good,” we can ask them to rate an emotion on a 1-10 scale or make use of the emotions wheel.

For example, you could ask: ‘How worried do you feel on a scale of 1-10?’

This technique can even work for adults who may struggle with identifying their emotions. 

It may be useful to give some constructive feedback to others about situations where they acted with poor emotional awareness. 

Did they not show enough care or support to people who needed their help? Did they say something that could be perceived as disrespectful or inconsiderate of others’ feelings? Are they often adopting unclear or inconsistent communication of tasks? 

Ensure this feedback is not confrontational or using blaming language but expressed in a kind manner so as to encourage open, healthy discussion. 

Encouraging cooperation within groups facilitates sharing of objectives, values, and concerns, which can ultimately result in an increased sense of group identity and commitment to tasks. 

To enhance a team’s EI, we can highlight participants’ strengths and weaknesses, build a team spirit to spark passion and motivation and constantly provide a space to reflect on personal progress and ways to improve existing skills.

“What really matters for success, character, happiness and life long achievements is a definite set of emotional skills – your EQ — not just purely cognitive abilities that are measured by conventional IQ tests.”

In accordance with Goleman’s statement, emotional intelligence can benefit our personal and professional life in several ways. 

It is a valuable tool to utilize when handling unpredictable and emotionally charged situations, it promotes better clarity of our motivations and goals, and it is an integral part of developing more satisfying relationships with others. 

EI is also a significant predictor of professional success, believed to account for 58% of performance in all types of jobs (Bradberry and Greaves, 2006).

Overall, EI has been found to subsume a variety of skills that are critical in our day-to-day life (Figure 1).

Increased sensitivity to the feelings of others allows more effective communication and prevents the escalation of tension and conflicts. 

As we are more aware of the emotional needs of the people we interact with, we are more likely to adopt a collaborative attitude and be open to compromise (Petrovici and Dobrescu, 2014).

Recognizing how specific situations can trigger stressful emotions can help us feel more in control of our reactions, replacing negative feelings with appropriate coping skills to deal with them. 

Neglecting how emotional stress drives our behaviors can lead to irrational decisions and ultimately exacerbate mental health outcomes (Ciarrochi, Deane, and Anderson, 2002).

Understanding how emotions influence our thoughts can prevent us from making misguided decisions, both in our personal lives and in the workplace. 

As we are able to identify emotions that are superfluous or unrelated to a problem, we can form more objective judgments and enhance the quality of decision-making (Hess and Bacigalupo, 2011).

Changes in our personal and professional life are constant and can sometimes be emotionally intense. 

Reflecting on the emotional reactions that make us resistant to change as well as the interpretations and preconceptions associated with them, can help us assume a more positive outlook and think more optimistically about opportunities that can derive from change (Lin et al., 2016).

With high EI, we can better understand the meaning of our aspirations and the motivational skills required to achieve goals in relation to our work, personal life, and health (Magnano, Craparo, and Paolillo, 2016). 

In addition, with the capacity to recognize emotions, we can also impact other people’s motivations, encouraging positive attitudes towards shared goals when working in teams.

Since EI is a skill that can be continuously developed and refined over time, it makes sense that our ability to deal with emotional challenges might increase with age. 

Indeed, research suggests that older adults are better able to balance emotions and cognition when problem-solving and making decisions compared to their younger counterparts. 

In addition, older adults seem to be better able to regulate emotions and minimize the intensity and duration of negative affect (Carstensen et al., 2000). 

At the same time, it is important to acknowledge that a person’s age does not always mirror their level of emotional maturity, and some EI competencies might require more consistent practice and training (Fariselli, Ghini, and Freedman, 2008).

Low EI manifests with difficulty dealing with our own feelings and relating to the emotional experiences of others (Goleman, 1996). 

Being emotionally disconnected may result in uncontrolled and impulsive behaviors, such as emotional outbursts, insensitive responses, or blaming others, all of which can compromise the quality of our relationships. 

Ignoring other people’s feelings can also increase the risk of conflicts if the conversations are too closed, self-centered and foster misunderstandings (Hansen, 2015). 

Ultimately, low EI may result in a reduction of a person’s social circle and level of emotional support, with detrimental effects on mental health and well-being.

Though IQ and EI are sometimes related, they represent two separate constructs that might present with different levels of development in the same person. 

Having a strong ability to analyze and interpret situations (often associated with a high IQ) does not necessarily translate into the ability to read other people’s emotions or attend to emotional cues. 

Similarly, the ability to find rational solutions to problems might not manifest in social situations where strong EI skills are needed to manage conflict and reach a compromise (Goleman, 2020).

Considering the increasingly important role of EI in academic and work success, as well as in managing stress and life transitions, there is a growing interest in teaching emotional intelligence to teenagers and students. 

In a classroom environment, incorporating training focused on enhancing assertive communication and managing negative self-talk can result in an improvement in EI skills (Chang, 2006). 

In addition, students who show the greatest benefit from EI programs are also more likely to persist with their studies in the future (Qualter et al., 2009). 

In practice, introducing behaviors in classrooms that are informed by EI principles, such as promoting collaboration between students and practicing self-reflection exercises, can help students gradually assimilate this skill.

Harvard Business School Online's Business Insights Blog provides the career insights you need to achieve your goals and gain confidence in your business skills.

Emotional intelligence is a crucial component of leadership. Your ability to manage your emotions, as well as recognize and influence others’, has been considered one of the strongest indicators of workplace performance. Research shows that 90 percent of top performers are high in emotional intelligence.

Technical skills will only get you so far. If you’re an aspiring or current leader, you need to build your emotional intelligence to bring out the best in others and cultivate high-performing teams.

“Leaders prime the emotional state of the organization,” said Travis Bradberry, president of emotional intelligence provider TalentSmart, to the Society for Human Resource Management. “When they’re ineffective, when they set poor examples of how they treat other people, that trickles down throughout the company.”

Emotional intelligence, also known as emotional quotient or EQ, is the ability to understand and manage your emotions and the emotions of others. 

Similar to IQ, emotional intelligence can be measured through various assessments, but IQ represents cognitive abilities while EQ is a measure of one’s emotional capabilities. 

While emotional intelligence is beneficial for everyone, it’s especially important for those in leadership positions. Emotionally intelligent leaders can empathize with others, communicate effectively, and manage conflict. All of these abilities are qualities of effective leaders.

If you want to enhance your leadership capabilities, here are five emotional intelligence skills you need and ways you can develop them.

Access your free e-book today.

Self-awareness is having a clear understanding of your strengths, limitations, emotions, beliefs, and motivations. It sounds simple enough, yet 79 percent of executives surveyed by organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry had at least one blind spot—or a skill they ranked among their strongest that others reported as a weakness.

Leaders who are adept at recognizing and managing their emotions are better equipped to perceive others’ feelings and know how to motivate employees. Those who don’t could see a slip in performance: Research in the  Harvard Business Review found that teams with individuals who lack self-awareness make worse decisions and are less effective at conflict management.

By acknowledging your weaknesses, you can build trust and transparency among your team. You can also own your professional development by knowing the areas in which you need to improve in order to advance your career.

Self-regulation refers to how you manage your emotions, behaviors, and impulses. The more self-aware you are, the easier this becomes; if you can recognize what you’re feeling and why, you can respond appropriately.

“In my experience, I’ve never seen the tendency toward radical outbursts to surface as an indicator of strong leadership,” writes Daniel Goleman, the psychologist who popularized emotional intelligence, on his website.

If prone to emotional outbursts or overreacting, there are tactics you can use to improve your self-regulation, such as:

If you acknowledge your emotions and give yourself time to process them, you can carefully craft how you respond and avoid doing anything that could jeopardize the goodwill you’ve worked hard to build.

Empathy is the capability of understanding another person’s experiences and emotions, and has been ranked as the top leadership skill needed today by global consulting firm DDI. According to DDI's research, leaders who excel at listening and responding with empathy perform more than 40 percent higher in coaching, planning, and decision-making.

According to a separate survey by Businessolver, 96 percent of employees rank empathy as important, but 92 percent say it’s undervalued. It shouldn’t be, though: Companies that prioritize empathy experience an increase in revenue, retention, and productivity.

By actively listening to your employees and taking the time to understand their wants and needs, you can boost engagement, build trust, and more effectively coach them through challenges. The more your team feels appreciated, the more invested they’ll be, which, in turn, leads to higher morale and stronger company culture.

Motivation refers to your ability to inspire both yourself and others to action. Here, it’s essential to lead by example. Self-motivated leaders care more about hitting organizational milestones than monetary awards. They set goals, take initiative, rise to the challenge, and stay optimistic during turbulent times.

The more positive you are, the more confident your team will feel. Your intrinsic motivation will permeate the organization, and you’ll have a better understanding of how to empower employees.

Social skills are all about how you perceive emotions and interact and communicate with others. For example, emotionally intelligent leaders can walk into a room of employees with pursed lips and clenched fists and not only sense the tension, but know how to address and resolve the conflict before it escalates.

The more in tune you are with your emotions, the easier it will be to assess others’. And if you can assess others’ feelings, you can more easily build and maintain relationships. Leaders with strong social skills know they can’t achieve success alone. Surpassing goals and reaching milestones requires collaboration, communication, and a shared vision.

Related: How to Give Feedback Effectively

If you have gaps in your current skill set, there are actions you can take to boost your emotional intelligence. Methods include:

At the end of the workday, reflect on how your meetings, projects, and interactions went—whether positive or negative. By writing your thoughts down, you can spot specific patterns about your behaviors and reactions, as well as others’.

Where did you excel? How are your employees feeling? Are there certain people or situations that frustrated you and, if so, why? The more introspective you are, the better. For example, you’ll become more aware of what upsets you, so that you can avoid a future outburst, or mimic actions that have proven to boost employee morale.

In a 360-degree assessment, you solicit feedback from your manager, colleagues, and peers, while also undergoing an individual self-assessment. Through the process, you can gain valuable insights into what your co-workers perceive as your strengths and weaknesses, as well as uncover any blind spots you might have.

According to Jack Zenger, CEO of leadership development firm Zenger Folkman, more than 85 percent of all Fortune 500 companies use 360-degree feedback. It can help improve leaders’ self-awareness, which, in turn, can result in improved workplace effectiveness, less stress, and stronger relationships.

According to Psychology Today, only about 10 percent of people listen effectively. It’s easy to get distracted by technology, background noise, and your own thoughts. Yet, to be an effective communicator and emotionally intelligent leader, you need to be a good listener. 

To become more emotionally intelligent, practice active listening. Try to focus on what the speaker is saying and show that you’re engaged by paraphrasing and using other non-verbal cues like nodding. By actively listening at work, it will be easier to connect with others and truly understand their thoughts and feelings.

To understand the emotions of others, you need to understand your own first.

When you catch yourself feeling a particularly strong emotion, whether it’s a positive or negative one, make a conscious effort to think about what you’re feeling. Take a second and consider why you’re feeling this way and what might have triggered such a strong emotional response.

This will help you become more aware of your own emotions and better understand your colleagues’. As an empathetic leader, you’ll be able to cultivate a high-performing team.





If you’re interested in diving deeper into emotional intelligence and enhancing your leadership capabilities, taking an online leadership course or training could be the best next step.

Online courses offer working professionals the flexibility to complete coursework on their schedule and connect with a global community of like-minded peers, all while gaining new skills and knowledge.

One program to consider is Harvard Business School Online’s Leadership Principles course, which provides a 360-degree assessment to help you better understand who you are as a leader and how others perceive you.



Building your emotional intelligence skills can not only help you grow as a leader but enable you to motivate and coach teams more effectively. In turn, you can make a greater impact on your organization by boosting morale, productivity, and communication—enabling you to advance your business and career simultaneously.

          An overview of the importance of Emotional Intelligence for your own success and the success of your organization.

Today’s in-demand skills are increasingly technical in nature. However, there’s a corresponding need for the uniquely human ability to work with and through others to accomplish important goals.

Enter emotional intelligence (EI), a set of skills that help us recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions as well as recognize, understand and influence the emotions of others.

We recently spoke with Margaret Andrews, instructor of Emotional Intelligence in Leadership, about how people can build EI for better interpersonal relations. Andrews is the former associate dean at Harvard University’s Division of Continuing Education and executive director at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

“Emotional intelligence is critical in building and maintaining relationships and influencing others — key skills that help people throughout their career and wherever they sit in an organizational structure,” says Andrews.

Additionally, research suggests that people with a high emotional quotient (EQ) are more innovative and have higher job satisfaction than those with lower EQs.

Let’s dive into what exactly EI entails, and how you can improve on this essential component of successful relationships.

Emotional intelligence is a set of skills and behaviors. While some people will be naturally more adept at certain aspects, EI can be learned, developed, and enhanced.

The four main components of EI are self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness, and social skills:

Self-awareness is the ability to identify and understand your own emotions and the impact we have on others. It’s the cornerstone of emotional intelligence and the other components of EI depend on this self-awareness.

“It all starts with self-awareness, which is foundation of EI, and it builds from there. If you’re aware of your own emotions and the behaviors they trigger, you can begin to manage these emotions and behaviors,” says Andrews.

Our emotions impact our mood, behaviors, performance, and interactions with other people. “We are all having emotions all the time,” says Andrews, “the question is whether you are aware of these emotions and the impact they have on your behavior — and other people.”

According to Tasha Eurich, an organizational psychologist, researcher, and author of Insight, people who are self-aware tend to be more confident and more creative. They also make better decisions, build stronger relationships, and communicate more effectively.

Self-awareness opens the door to self-regulation, which is the ability to manage these emotions and behaviors. Once we’re aware of our emotions, we can begin to manage them and keep the disruptive emotions and impulses under control.

“People with strong self-regulation can pause and take a deep breath in tense and stressful situations, explains Andrews, “which helps them remain calm and think before they speak or act.”

These people tend toward a positive outlook and are adaptable to a variety of situations and circumstances. “On the flip side,” she says, “those that cannot contain their negative emotions and impulses often set off a chain reaction of negative emotions in others.”

“There’s an old adage that people join organizations and leave managers,” says Andrews, “and it’s true. So, companies — or managers — that have high turnover rates should take a look in the mirror.”

Social awareness is our ability to understand the emotions of others and a key component of this is empathy.

Jamil Zaki, a Stanford professor and author of The War for Kindness, describes empathy as having three components — identifying what others feel, sharing this emotion, and wishing to improve their experience.

“It’s not about how you would feel in their situation, but rather, how they actually feel,” says Andrews.

People with strong social awareness tend toward kindness. However, this doesn’t mean they cannot give others difficult feedback — in fact, they may be better at delivering this ‘tough love’ because they understand the other person and want to help them improve.

“Social skills are what separate a great manager from a good one,” says Andrews.

These skills, which include influence, conflict management, teamwork, and the ability to inspire others, make it possible to build and maintain healthy relationships in all parts of your life.

People with strong social skills can make an enormous difference on a team and in organizations because they understand others and act on this knowledge to move people toward a common goal.

To improve your emotional intelligence, you need to start at the beginning, with self-awareness. However, gauging your self-awareness is innately difficult because, as Andrews puts it, “you don’t know what you don’t know.”

Without an objective sense of who you are and what drives you, it’s nearly impossible to be emotionally intelligent. Andrews cites a study by Tasha Eurich which found that 95 percent of participants gave themselves high marks in self-awareness.

However, using more empirical measures of self-awareness, the study found that only 10-15 percent of the cohort was truly self-aware.

That’s a pretty big gap, and one that suggests most of us aren’t very self-aware. What’s worse, research also shows that managers and CEOs may be the least self-aware of all. This is not despite their authority, but quite possibly because of it.

Eurich wrote in the Harvard Business Review that the more power someone obtains, the more likely they are to be overconfident about how well they know themselves. After all, those at the top of the chain have fewer people giving them feedback.

Often, when managers do receive feedback from employees, it isn’t as honest as it might be because subordinates are afraid of incurring negative consequences. Managers are insulated from criticism, and as a result, self-awareness sinks.

Receiving honest, constructive feedback is key to becoming self-aware. Andrews notes that a 360-degree emotional intelligence assessment can be a very effective way to gain insight into your EI-components and the impact you have on others.

“Many people shrug off differences in how they rate themselves versus how others rate them on EI competencies by saying that they’re too hard on themselves or that others don’t really understand their intent,” says Andrews, “but really it shows a lack of self-awareness.”

Emotional intelligence is a set of skills and behaviors that can be learned and developed. Here are some telltale signs of people with low EQ and those with high EQ.

People with low EQ:

People with high EQ:

Developing emotional intelligence is an ongoing process. The journey differs from person to person. Nonetheless, according to Andrews, the following actions may lead you to better self-awareness, empathy, and social skills.

What emotions are you feeling right now? Can you name them? When in a stressful situation, what emotions typically arise? How would you like to respond in these situations? Can you stop to pause and reconsider your response? Taking a moment to name your feelings and temper your reactivity is an integral step toward EI.

Audit your self-perception by asking managers, colleagues, friends, or family how they would rate your emotional intelligence. For example, ask them about how you respond to difficult situations, how adaptable or empathetic you are, and/or how well you handle conflict. It may not always be what you want to hear, but it will often be what you need to hear.

Studies show that reading literature with complex characters can improve empathy. Reading stories from other people’s perspectives helps us gain insight into their thoughts, motivations, and actions and may help enhance your social awareness.

Building E.I. in yourself is one thing, but influencing others to adopt a more empathetic mindset can be a challenge. To create a culture of high EQ, managers and supervisors must model emotionally intelligent behavior.

“If you want to change how your organization does in EI, you can set norms for how people communicate and how they disagree,” says Andrews.

In addition, you need to recognize and celebrate those that exhibit emotional intelligence.;

“Start making heroes of people who help other people,” says Andrews. “It’s not just the person who got to the top of the mountain first — it’s all the people who helped them. If you want to encourage good team behavior, recognize it, and call it out for what it is.”

        Emotional Intelligence


Emotional intelligence fuels your performance both in the workplace and in your personal life, but it starts with you. From your confidence, empathy and optimism to your social skills and self-control, understanding and managing your own emotions can accelerate success in all areas of your life.

No matter what professional field you are in, whether you manage a team of two or 20, or even just yourself, realising how effective you are at controlling your own emotional energy is a great starting point. Absent from the curriculum, emotional intelligence isn’t something we are taught or tested on, so where did it come from, what is it, do you have it and is it really that important?

Fortunately, it is something you can learn and we’ve compiled a comprehensive list of tips to help you explore your own level of emotional intelligence and gain important emotional intelligence skills that can be implemented into everyday life. Some of these tips we follow ourselves and others have been revealed to us by our amazing clients and partners who know how to motivate and inspire their teams but first and foremost, themselves.

1. Emotional Intelligence2. Self-awareness3. Self-management4. Motivation5. Empathy6. Social skills7. What to avoid

 

Put simply, Emotional Intelligence is how well individuals identify and manage their own emotions and react to the emotions of others. It’s understanding how those emotions shape your thoughts and actions so you can have greater control over your behaviour and develop the skills to manage yourself more effectively. Becoming more emotionally conscious allows us to grow and gain a deeper understanding of who we are, enabling us to communicate better with others and build stronger relationships.

We suggest starting with these initial 8 tips, they provide a good starting point to discovering the foundations of your emotional intelligence.

#1) Practice observing how you feelOften we lead hectic, busy lifestyles and it’s all too easy for us to lose touch with our emotions. To reconnect, try setting a timer for various points during the day. When the timer goes off, take a few deep breaths and notice how you’re feeling emotionally. Pay attention to where that emotion is showing up as a physical feeling in your body and what the sensation feels like. The more you practice, the more it will become second nature.

#2) Pay attention to how you behaveWhile you’re practising your emotional awareness, take the time to notice your behaviour too. Observe how you act when you’re experiencing certain emotions, and how that affects your day-to-day life. Managing our emotions becomes easier once we become more conscious of how we react to them.

#3) Question your own opinionsIn this hyper-connected world, it is easy to fall into an ‘opinion bubble’. This is a state of existence where your own opinions are constantly re-enforced by people with similar viewpoints. Take time to read the other side of the story and have your views challenged (even if you still feel they are right). This will help you understand other people and be more receptive to new ideas.

#4) Take responsibility for your feelingsYour emotions and behaviour come from you, they don’t come from anyone else and once you start accepting responsibility for how you feel and how you behave it will have a positive impact on all areas of your life.



#5) Take time to celebrate the positiveA key part emotional intelligence is celebrating and reflecting on the positive moments in life. People who experience positive emotions are generally more resilient and more likely to have fulfilling relationships, which will help them move past adversity.

#6) But don’t ignore the negative

Reflecting on negative feelings is just as important as reflecting on the positive. Understanding why you feel negative is key to becoming a fully-rounded individual, who is more able to deal with negative issues in the future.

#7) Don’t forget to breathe

Life throws various situations our way, with most of us experiencing some sort of stress on a regular basis. To manage your emotions when this happens and to avoid outbursts, don’t forget to breathe. Call a time out and go put some cold water on your face, go outside and get some fresh air or make a drink – anything to keep your cool and give yourself a chance to get a hold on what’s happening and how you should respond.

#8) A lifetime processUnderstand and remember that emotional intelligence is something you develop and requires continual improvement; it’s very much a lifetime practice.

A key component of emotional intelligence, self-awareness is the ability to recognise and understand your own character, moods and emotions and their effect on others. It includes a realistic self-assessment of what you’re capable of – your strengths and weaknesses – and knowing how others perceive you. It can help highlight areas for self-improvement, make you better at adapting and can limit wrongful decisions.

#9) Learn to look at yourself objectivelyKnowing yourself completely is difficult and it’s almost impossible to look at yourself objectively, so input from those who know you is vital. Ask them where your strengths and weaknesses lie, write down what they say and compare it. Look out for any patterns and remember not to argue with them – it doesn’t mean they’re right – they’re just trying to help you gauge your perception from another’s point of view.

#10) Keep a diaryA great way to get an accurate gauge of yourself is to keep a diary. Start by writing down what happened to you at the end of every day, how it made you feel and how you dealt with it. Documenting details like these will make you more aware of what you’re doing and will highlight where problems might be coming from. Periodically, look back over your comments and take note of any trends.

#11) Understand what motivates youEveryone has a core motivation when they begin a project. The difficulty is keeping this driving force in mind when adversity appears. All too often people start a project but fail to complete it because they lose their motivation to do so. Take time to understand what motivates you and use it to push you across the finish line.

#12) Take it easy

Sometimes emotional outbreaks occur because we don’t take the time out to slow down and process how we’re feeling. Give yourself a break and make a conscious effort to meditate, do yoga or read – a little escapism works wonders. And then the next time you have an emotional reaction to something, try to pause before you react.

#13) Acknowledge your emotional triggers

Self-aware individuals are able to recognise their emotions as they occur. It’s important to be flexible with your emotions and adapt them to your situation. Don’t deny your emotions stage time but don’t be rigid with them either, take the time to process your emotions before communicating them.

#14) Predict how you will feelThink about a situation you’re going into and predict how you will feel. Practice naming and accepting the feelings – naming the feeling puts you in control. Try to choose an appropriate reaction to the feeling rather than just reacting to it.



#15) Trust your intuitionIf you are still unsure about which path to take, trust your intuition. After all, your subconscious has been learning which path to take throughout your entire life.

Once you’ve gotten to grips with self-awareness and how your emotions work, you can get a handle on self-management. Which means taking responsibility for your own behaviour and well-being as well as controlling emotional outbursts.

#16) Snap out of itOne key way to keep your emotions in check is to change your sensory input – motion dictates emotion as the old saying goes. So jolt your physical body out of routine by attending an exercise class or try channelling a busy mind with a puzzle or a book – anything to break your existing routine.

#17) Maintain a schedule (and stick to it!)Ensuring that you create a schedule and stick to it is extremely important if you want to complete tasks effectively.

Paul Minors of Productivityist writes “When you schedule appointments in your calendar, you’re saying to yourself: “I’m going to do A, B and C by X date and it’s going to take Y hours. Once you make this promise, it becomes harder to procrastinate.”

#18) Eat well

This sounds like an easy one but regulating what you eat and drink can have a massive effect on your emotional state, so try your best to maintain a balanced diet.

#19) Don’t get mad

Funnel your emotional energy into something productive. It’s okay to keep overwhelming emotions inside, especially if it’s not an appropriate time to let them out. However, when you do, rather than vent it on something futile, turn it into motivation instead. Don’t get mad, get better.

#20) Be interestedA key factor in managing yourself and your emotions is consciously taken the time to be interested in the subject matter, whether it be business or personal.

#21) Don’t expect people to trust you (if you can’t trust them)

Establishing trust with a person can be difficult, and once it’s lost it’s very hard to regain. Try to be mindful that people are only human and will make mistakes. By offering your trust, you are inviting people to offer their trust in return.

#22) It’s your choiceYou have the ability to choose how you react to a situation – you can either overreact or remain calm. But it’s your choice.

A personal skills aspect of emotional intelligence, self-motivation refers to our inner drive to achieve and improve our commitment to our goals, our readiness to act on opportunities and our overall optimism.

#23) Personal goalsPersonal goals can provide long-term direction and short-term motivation. So grab a pen and paper and have a think about where you want to be and set some targets for yourself. Base them on your strengths and make them relevant to you and ultimately, make them exciting and achievable. This task alone is enough to get you instantly motivated!

#24) Be realisticWhen you’ve set a new goal, be sure to give yourself realistic and clear aims to achieving that goal and understand that change is an inevitable part of life. Achievement boosts confidence and as self-confidence rises so does the ability to achieve more, see how it works?

#25) Positive thinkingTo keep motivated it’s important to maintain a positive and optimistic mindset. See problems and setbacks as learning opportunities instead of failings and try to avoid negative people and opt to surround yourself with positive, well-motivated people – they’ll have a great effect on you.



#26) Lifelong learningBoth knowledge and information are key for feeding your mind and keeping you curious and motivated. And with information so easily accessible, you have the opportunity to fuel your values and passions at the click of a button!

#27) Be prepared to leave your comfort zoneThe biggest barrier to achieving your full potential is not challenging yourself frequently enough. Great things can happen to you if you’re willing to leave your comfort zone, so do so as often as you can.

#28) Help

Don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it, and vice versa. If others need help, don’t hold back in giving it to them. Seeing other people succeed will only help to motivate yourself.

#29) Stand and stretchFor an instant short term boost to your motivation, take a stand and stretch out as far as you can for 10 seconds. When you return to your desk, you’ll be in the correct frame of mind and ready to work.

Quite simply, empathy is the ability to understand other people’s emotions. Understanding that everyone has their own set of feelings, desires, triggers and fears. To be empathetic you’re allowing their experiences to resonate with your own in order to respond in an emotionally appropriate way. It’s a lifelong skill and the most important one for navigating relationships, and whilst it may not come naturally, there are a few ways it can be nurtured.

#30) Listen

Before you’re able to empathise with someone you first need to understand what it is they’re saying, which means listening is at the very epicentre of empathy. It involves letting them talk without interruption, preconceptions, scepticism and putting your own issues on pause to allow yourself to absorb their situation and consider how they are feeling before you react.

#31) Try to be approachableWhether you’re the leader of a team or working on a project with others, try to remain accessible and approachable.

#32) PerspectiveWe’re all familiar with the phrase “put yourself in their shoes”, and this is exactly that. The simplest way of gaining a little perspective the next time an issue or situation arises is to switch places with the other person and really think about what’s happening from their point of view. Sometimes there’s no right or wrong but at least you’ll understand enough to come to a resolve or offer some useful advice.

#33) Open yourself upOne of the quickest ways to offer a sincere exchange or sign of empathy is to listen to someone’s experiences and connect to it with a similar experience of your own. Don’t be afraid to open yourself up, it might just be the start of a great and lasting friendship.



#34) Immerse yourself in a new cultureThe old saying ‘travel broadens the mind’ is still true, even in this ever shrinking world. Sometimes the best way to open your mind is to jump on a plane and go somewhere completely different.

#35) Cultivate a curiosity about strangers

Highly empathetic people have an insatiable curiosity about strangers. When we talk to people outside of our usual social circle we learn about and begin to understand opinions, views and lives that are different to our own. So next time you’re sat on a bus you know just what to do…

#36) Acknowledge what people are sayingAnother useful tip is, whilst listening to what a person has to say, use acknowledgement words such as ‘I understand’ and ‘I see’ to show a person you’re listening (but of course only say these things if you are actually listening!).

In emotional intelligence terms, social skills refer to the skills needed to handle and influence other people’s emotions effectively. It covers a wide range of abilities, from communication and conflict management to dealing with change, meeting new people and building relationships and plays a part in almost every part of our lives, from work life to our romantic life. It’s complex and requires utilising almost every point we have already mentioned, but here are a few pointers for you.

#37) Get startedA good way to get started on improving your social skills is to isolate one skill you know you’d like to develop, this narrows it down and gives you focus. Internationally known psychologist, Daniel Goleman, suggests highlighting someone you know to be good at that particular skill, observing how they act and how they control their emotions and then implementing and applying that knowledge to yourself.

#38) Wear somebody else’s shoesNot literally of course! Everyone has heard the phrase ‘walk a mile in somebody else’s shoes’, but how many people actually practice this advice? Give it a try, you never know.

#39) Practice makes perfectThe idea of practising your social skills might sound strange, but like everything in life, practice makes perfect.

#40) Social media cold turkeyWe don’t mean to sound old, but taking your social life offline and engaging face-to-face with people will open up so many opportunities for you to gain and develop your social skills. So next time instead of instant messaging your best friend, meet up for a drink! Emotional intelligence doesn’t expand within the confines of (un) social media…

#41) Get networkingA good way to practise your social acumen is to attend local networking events. The great thing about these events is that everyone attending has a shared reason for attending.

#42) It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it

We’re talking about the importance of nonverbal communication and how that can affect a person’s opinion of you. Body language, tone of voice and eye contact is key to letting others know how you feel emotionally. So once you’ve got your emotions intact, think about how you’re physically coming across.

#43) The unknownThe ultimate method to building your social skills is to get out there and be sociable. It sounds simple, but you can’t strengthen your social skills without being social! Join a group or network outside of your usual circle; it’s the perfect way to put all of our tips into play.

Those with a high EQ very rarely display the following traits, something for you to be mindful of.

#44) DramaEmotionally intelligent people listen, offer sound advice and extend empathy to those who need it but they don’t permit others’ lives and emotions to effect or rule their own.

#45) ComplainingComplaining implies two things – one, that we are victims, and two, that there are no solutions to our problems. Rarely does an emotionally intelligent person feel victimised, and even more infrequently do they feel that a solution is beyond their grasp. So instead of looking for someone or something to blame, they think constructively and dissolve the solution in private.



#46) NegativityEmotionally intelligent people have the ability to kerb cynical thoughts. They acknowledge that negative thoughts are just that – thoughts – and rely on facts to come to conclusions as well as being able to silence or zone out any negativity.

#47) Dwelling on the pastThose with high emotional intelligence choose to learn from the mistakes and choices they have made and instead of dwelling on the past are mindful to live in the now.

#48) SelfishnessWhilst a degree of selfishness is required to get ahead in life, too much can fracture relationships and cause disharmony. Try to avoid being overly selfish and consider others needs.

#49) Giving in to peer pressureJust because everyone else does something, they don’t feel compelled to follow suit if they don’t want to. They think independently, and never conform just to please other people.

#50) Being overly criticalNothing destroys a person’s morale faster than being overly critical. Remember that people are only human and have the same motivations (and limitations) as you. Take the time to understand another person then communicate the change you want to see.

By understanding and successfully applying emotional intelligence, you too can reach your full potential and achieve your goals.

Harvard Business School Online's Business Insights Blog provides the career insights you need to achieve your goals and gain confidence in your business skills.

Emotional intelligence is a crucial component of leadership. Your ability to manage your emotions, as well as recognize and influence others’, has been considered one of the strongest indicators of workplace performance. Research shows that 90 percent of top performers are high in emotional intelligence.

Technical skills will only get you so far. If you’re an aspiring or current leader, you need to build your emotional intelligence to bring out the best in others and cultivate high-performing teams.

“Leaders prime the emotional state of the organization,” said Travis Bradberry, president of emotional intelligence provider TalentSmart, to the Society for Human Resource Management. “When they’re ineffective, when they set poor examples of how they treat other people, that trickles down throughout the company.”

Emotional intelligence, also known as emotional quotient or EQ, is the ability to understand and manage your emotions and the emotions of others. 

Similar to IQ, emotional intelligence can be measured through various assessments, but IQ represents cognitive abilities while EQ is a measure of one’s emotional capabilities. 

While emotional intelligence is beneficial for everyone, it’s especially important for those in leadership positions. Emotionally intelligent leaders can empathize with others, communicate effectively, and manage conflict. All of these abilities are qualities of effective leaders.

If you want to enhance your leadership capabilities, here are five emotional intelligence skills you need and ways you can develop them.

Self-awareness is having a clear understanding of your strengths, limitations, emotions, beliefs, and motivations. It sounds simple enough, yet 79 percent of executives surveyed by organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry had at least one blind spot—or a skill they ranked among their strongest that others reported as a weakness.

Leaders who are adept at recognizing and managing their emotions are better equipped to perceive others’ feelings and know how to motivate employees. Those who don’t could see a slip in performance: Research in the  Harvard Business Review found that teams with individuals who lack self-awareness make worse decisions and are less effective at conflict management.

By acknowledging your weaknesses, you can build trust and transparency among your team. You can also own your professional development by knowing the areas in which you need to improve in order to advance your career.

Self-regulation refers to how you manage your emotions, behaviors, and impulses. The more self-aware you are, the easier this becomes; if you can recognize what you’re feeling and why, you can respond appropriately.

“In my experience, I’ve never seen the tendency toward radical outbursts to surface as an indicator of strong leadership,” writes Daniel Goleman, the psychologist who popularized emotional intelligence, on his website.

If prone to emotional outbursts or overreacting, there are tactics you can use to improve your self-regulation, such as:

If you acknowledge your emotions and give yourself time to process them, you can carefully craft how you respond and avoid doing anything that could jeopardize the goodwill you’ve worked hard to build.

Empathy is the capability of understanding another person’s experiences and emotions, and has been ranked as the top leadership skill needed today by global consulting firm DDI. According to DDI's research, leaders who excel at listening and responding with empathy perform more than 40 percent higher in coaching, planning, and decision-making.

According to a separate survey by Businessolver, 96 percent of employees rank empathy as important, but 92 percent say it’s undervalued. It shouldn’t be, though: Companies that prioritize empathy experience an increase in revenue, retention, and productivity.

By actively listening to your employees and taking the time to understand their wants and needs, you can boost engagement, build trust, and more effectively coach them through challenges. The more your team feels appreciated, the more invested they’ll be, which, in turn, leads to higher morale and stronger company culture.

Motivation refers to your ability to inspire both yourself and others to action. Here, it’s essential to lead by example. Self-motivated leaders care more about hitting organizational milestones than monetary awards. They set goals, take initiative, rise to the challenge, and stay optimistic during turbulent times.

The more positive you are, the more confident your team will feel. Your intrinsic motivation will permeate the organization, and you’ll have a better understanding of how to empower employees.

Social skills are all about how you perceive emotions and interact and communicate with others. For example, emotionally intelligent leaders can walk into a room of employees with pursed lips and clenched fists and not only sense the tension, but know how to address and resolve the conflict before it escalates.

The more in tune you are with your emotions, the easier it will be to assess others’. And if you can assess others’ feelings, you can more easily build and maintain relationships. Leaders with strong social skills know they can’t achieve success alone. Surpassing goals and reaching milestones requires collaboration, communication, and a shared vision.

At the end of the workday, reflect on how your meetings, projects, and interactions went—whether positive or negative. By writing your thoughts down, you can spot specific patterns about your behaviors and reactions, as well as others’.

Where did you excel? How are your employees feeling? Are there certain people or situations that frustrated you and, if so, why? The more introspective you are, the better. For example, you’ll become more aware of what upsets you, so that you can avoid a future outburst, or mimic actions that have proven to boost employee morale.

In a 360-degree assessment, you solicit feedback from your manager, colleagues, and peers, while also undergoing an individual self-assessment. Through the process, you can gain valuable insights into what your co-workers perceive as your strengths and weaknesses, as well as uncover any blind spots you might have.

According to Jack Zenger, CEO of leadership development firm Zenger Folkman, more than 85 percent of all Fortune 500 companies use 360-degree feedback. It can help improve leaders’ self-awareness, which, in turn, can result in improved workplace effectiveness, less stress, and stronger relationships.

According to Psychology Today, only about 10 percent of people listen effectively. It’s easy to get distracted by technology, background noise, and your own thoughts. Yet, to be an effective communicator and emotionally intelligent leader, you need to be a good listener. 

To become more emotionally intelligent, practice active listening. Try to focus on what the speaker is saying and show that you’re engaged by paraphrasing and using other non-verbal cues like nodding. By actively listening at work, it will be easier to connect with others and truly understand their thoughts and feelings.

To understand the emotions of others, you need to understand your own first.

When you catch yourself feeling a particularly strong emotion, whether it’s a positive or negative one, make a conscious effort to think about what you’re feeling. Take a second and consider why you’re feeling this way and what might have triggered such a strong emotional response.

This will help you become more aware of your own emotions and better understand your colleagues’. As an empathetic leader, you’ll be able to cultivate a high-performing team.





If you’re interested in diving deeper into emotional intelligence and enhancing your leadership capabilities, taking an online leadership course or training could be the best next step.

Online courses offer working professionals the flexibility to complete coursework on their schedule and connect with a global community of like-minded peers, all while gaining new skills and knowledge.

One program to consider is Harvard Business School Online’s Leadership Principles course, which provides a 360-degree assessment to help you better understand who you are as a leader and how others perceive you.



Building your emotional intelligence skills can not only help you grow as a leader but enable you to motivate and coach teams more effectively. In turn, you can make a greater impact on your organization by boosting morale, productivity, and communication—enabling you to advance your business and career simultaneously.

          An overview of the importance of Emotional Intelligence for your own success and the success of your organization.
        

Blog

Today’s in-demand skills are increasingly technical in nature. However, there’s a corresponding need for the uniquely human ability to work with and through others to accomplish important goals.

Enter emotional intelligence (EI), a set of skills that help us recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions as well as recognize, understand and influence the emotions of others.

We recently spoke with Margaret Andrews, instructor of Emotional Intelligence in Leadership, about how people can build EI for better interpersonal relations. Andrews is the former associate dean at Harvard University’s Division of Continuing Education and executive director at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

“Emotional intelligence is critical in building and maintaining relationships and influencing others — key skills that help people throughout their career and wherever they sit in an organizational structure,” says Andrews.

Additionally, research suggests that people with a high emotional quotient (EQ) are more innovative and have higher job satisfaction than those with lower EQs.

Let’s dive into what exactly EI entails, and how you can improve on this essential component of successful relationships.

Emotional intelligence is a set of skills and behaviors. While some people will be naturally more adept at certain aspects, EI can be learned, developed, and enhanced.

The four main components of EI are self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness, and social skills:

Self-awareness is the ability to identify and understand your own emotions and the impact we have on others. It’s the cornerstone of emotional intelligence and the other components of EI depend on this self-awareness.

“It all starts with self-awareness, which is foundation of EI, and it builds from there. If you’re aware of your own emotions and the behaviors they trigger, you can begin to manage these emotions and behaviors,” says Andrews.

Our emotions impact our mood, behaviors, performance, and interactions with other people. “We are all having emotions all the time,” says Andrews, “the question is whether you are aware of these emotions and the impact they have on your behavior — and other people.”

According to Tasha Eurich, an organizational psychologist, researcher, and author of Insight, people who are self-aware tend to be more confident and more creative. They also make better decisions, build stronger relationships, and communicate more effectively.

Self-awareness opens the door to self-regulation, which is the ability to manage these emotions and behaviors. Once we’re aware of our emotions, we can begin to manage them and keep the disruptive emotions and impulses under control.

“People with strong self-regulation can pause and take a deep breath in tense and stressful situations, explains Andrews, “which helps them remain calm and think before they speak or act.”

These people tend toward a positive outlook and are adaptable to a variety of situations and circumstances. “On the flip side,” she says, “those that cannot contain their negative emotions and impulses often set off a chain reaction of negative emotions in others.”

“There’s an old adage that people join organizations and leave managers,” says Andrews, “and it’s true. So, companies — or managers — that have high turnover rates should take a look in the mirror.”

Social awareness is our ability to understand the emotions of others and a key component of this is empathy.

Jamil Zaki, a Stanford professor and author of The War for Kindness, describes empathy as having three components — identifying what others feel, sharing this emotion, and wishing to improve their experience.

“It’s not about how you would feel in their situation, but rather, how they actually feel,” says Andrews.

People with strong social awareness tend toward kindness. However, this doesn’t mean they cannot give others difficult feedback — in fact, they may be better at delivering this ‘tough love’ because they understand the other person and want to help them improve.

“Social skills are what separate a great manager from a good one,” says Andrews.

These skills, which include influence, conflict management, teamwork, and the ability to inspire others, make it possible to build and maintain healthy relationships in all parts of your life.

People with strong social skills can make an enormous difference on a team and in organizations because they understand others and act on this knowledge to move people toward a common goal.

To improve your emotional intelligence, you need to start at the beginning, with self-awareness. However, gauging your self-awareness is innately difficult because, as Andrews puts it, “you don’t know what you don’t know.”

Without an objective sense of who you are and what drives you, it’s nearly impossible to be emotionally intelligent. Andrews cites a study by Tasha Eurich which found that 95 percent of participants gave themselves high marks in self-awareness.

However, using more empirical measures of self-awareness, the study found that only 10-15 percent of the cohort was truly self-aware.

That’s a pretty big gap, and one that suggests most of us aren’t very self-aware. What’s worse, research also shows that managers and CEOs may be the least self-aware of all. This is not despite their authority, but quite possibly because of it.

Eurich wrote in the Harvard Business Review that the more power someone obtains, the more likely they are to be overconfident about how well they know themselves. After all, those at the top of the chain have fewer people giving them feedback.

Often, when managers do receive feedback from employees, it isn’t as honest as it might be because subordinates are afraid of incurring negative consequences. Managers are insulated from criticism, and as a result, self-awareness sinks.

Receiving honest, constructive feedback is key to becoming self-aware. Andrews notes that a 360-degree emotional intelligence assessment can be a very effective way to gain insight into your EI-components and the impact you have on others.

“Many people shrug off differences in how they rate themselves versus how others rate them on EI competencies by saying that they’re too hard on themselves or that others don’t really understand their intent,” says Andrews, “but really it shows a lack of self-awareness.”

Emotional intelligence is a set of skills and behaviors that can be learned and developed. Here are some telltale signs of people with low EQ and those with high EQ.

People with low EQ:

People with high EQ:

Developing emotional intelligence is an ongoing process. The journey differs from person to person. Nonetheless, according to Andrews, the following actions may lead you to better self-awareness, empathy, and social skills.

What emotions are you feeling right now? Can you name them? When in a stressful situation, what emotions typically arise? How would you like to respond in these situations? Can you stop to pause and reconsider your response? Taking a moment to name your feelings and temper your reactivity is an integral step toward EI.

Audit your self-perception by asking managers, colleagues, friends, or family how they would rate your emotional intelligence. For example, ask them about how you respond to difficult situations, how adaptable or empathetic you are, and/or how well you handle conflict. It may not always be what you want to hear, but it will often be what you need to hear.

Studies show that reading literature with complex characters can improve empathy. Reading stories from other people’s perspectives helps us gain insight into their thoughts, motivations, and actions and may help enhance your social awareness.

Building E.I. in yourself is one thing, but influencing others to adopt a more empathetic mindset can be a challenge. To create a culture of high EQ, managers and supervisors must model emotionally intelligent behavior.

“If you want to change how your organization does in EI, you can set norms for how people communicate and how they disagree,” says Andrews.

In addition, you need to recognize and celebrate those that exhibit emotional intelligence.;

“Start making heroes of people who help other people,” says Andrews. “It’s not just the person who got to the top of the mountain first — it’s all the people who helped them. If you want to encourage good team behavior, recognize it, and call it out for what it is.”

Learn about our Editorial Process

Emotional intelligence (EI or EQ) is the ability to identify and regulate our own emotions as well as recognize, understand, and engage with the emotions of others (Goleman, 1996). 

It is a critical skill to build stronger and empathetic relationships, and it helps connect with our deepest feelings, allowing us to make decisions that are more aligned with our values and personal goals. 

Emotional intelligence is a flexible skill that can be learned. 

Even though some individuals might naturally be more emotionally intelligent than others, high EI can be developed with time through regular practice.

Below are some ways which may help to increase emotional intelligence.

Active listening is about hearing beyond people’s words. It involves fully attuning to what is being communicated, including the content of the message and the attitude that underlies it (Rogers and Farson, 1957). 

Paying attention to another’s body language, as well as the tone and speed of their voice, can help identify the speaker’s emotional state in that moment and any messages beyond what they are saying. 

To practice active listening, it is important to let the other person’s train of thought flow without interruptions, as this will facilitate open communication and create a climate of trust and acceptance. 

Secondly, controlling external and internal distractions can help facilitate active listening. In particular, the internal chatter in our minds and the need to plan our responses will allow us to be fully present in the moment and sharpen our listening skills (Lunenburg, 2010).   

When experiencing uncomfortable emotions, we might have the tendency to ignore them or bottle them up rather than accept them as a normal and sometimes useful part of our life.

Leaning into our uncomfortable emotions can give us the opportunity to deal with our feelings productively, increasing our self-awareness and ability to introduce positive changes in our lives (Bradberry and Greaves, 2009). 

By exploring with curiosity our full range of emotions, we can gain a more objective view of the person we are and how our feelings are influencing our actions. To see things from a wider perspective, we can also open up to feedback from others, asking about specific situations where we acted with poor emotional awareness.

Learning to label emotions with more specific vocabulary can help identify more precisely the type of emotional state we are experiencing and feel more in control of our responses (David, 2016). 

Beyond the six core emotions – happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise – there is a vast spectrum that can be explored through the emotions wheel (Figure 2). 

By recognizing, for example, that sadness differs from boredom or a sense of loneliness; we can become better able to pinpoint our emotions and manage them effectively. 

An additional strategy to develop emotional awareness might be keeping a diary, where we write a description of our emotions and how these are brought up by specific circumstances. 

After a few weeks, we may begin to see patterns. We may come to understand which emotions are most difficult for us to tolerate, which ones are triggering, and which ones contribute to feeling more connected with our own values and satisfaction with our lives.

Knowing what situations are triggering is critical for developing the ability to manage our emotional reactions and maintain calm. 

We can use a diary to also identify the sources of stress or write down a list that includes a) specific situations – when we are most likely to feel frightened, disempowered, or not in control b) people – for example, those who appear to be toxic, friends not respecting boundaries or work colleagues trying to impose their opinions c) conditions in the environment – such as crowded or noisy places. 

This will help us anticipate our stressors and then think about ways to put in place strategies to handle our emotions more appropriately (Bradberry and Greaves, 2009).  

Once we develop greater openness towards our emotions, it is also important to learn how to use them to our advantage rather than letting them control us. 

The first step is to avoid judging our emotions and labeling them as good or bad. Instead, we should recognize them as powerful sources of information which can be used to drive our actions toward what matters to us (Bradberry and Greaves, 2009). 

Refocusing our attention on things that are under our control and can be improved also allows us to not feel trapped in a downward emotional spiral and engage in more committed actions. 

To give our minds a break, we should also prioritize scheduling activities in our routines that make us feel mentally recharged. These may include exercise, yoga, meditation, or other relaxing activities for the mind.

Developing emotional competencies is not only important at the personal level. 

Encouraging emotional intelligence in others, including children, students, romantic partners, and work teams, can help increase sensitivity to emotional cues that are often missed within oneself and the environment and ultimately boost the quality of interpersonal relationships (Nagarjuna Nagar, 2020). 

There are a few tips we can follow to enhance EI in others:

Creating opportunities to share opinions can help build trust in both dyadic and group interactions, reinforcing the importance of self-expression and promoting transparent communication between individuals. 

For example, in a work setting, we might start by asking our team how they are feeling about a particular decision rather than appointing a quick solution to a problem without explaining the rationale behind it. 

We might also try to engage in conversations by asking our co-workers about things that disappoint them at work, what motivates them the most, and how they deal with emotional stress related to work.

To encourage self-expression in others, such as in children, we might ask them to name an emotion matching their present state. If they find this exercise difficult or give flat answers like “I feel fine/good,” we can ask them to rate an emotion on a 1-10 scale or make use of the emotions wheel.

For example, you could ask: ‘How worried do you feel on a scale of 1-10?’

This technique can even work for adults who may struggle with identifying their emotions. 

It may be useful to give some constructive feedback to others about situations where they acted with poor emotional awareness. 

Did they not show enough care or support to people who needed their help? Did they say something that could be perceived as disrespectful or inconsiderate of others’ feelings? Are they often adopting unclear or inconsistent communication of tasks? 

Ensure this feedback is not confrontational or using blaming language but expressed in a kind manner so as to encourage open, healthy discussion. 

Encouraging cooperation within groups facilitates sharing of objectives, values, and concerns, which can ultimately result in an increased sense of group identity and commitment to tasks. 

To enhance a team’s EI, we can highlight participants’ strengths and weaknesses, build a team spirit to spark passion and motivation and constantly provide a space to reflect on personal progress and ways to improve existing skills.

“What really matters for success, character, happiness and life long achievements is a definite set of emotional skills – your EQ — not just purely cognitive abilities that are measured by conventional IQ tests.”

In accordance with Goleman’s statement, emotional intelligence can benefit our personal and professional life in several ways. 

It is a valuable tool to utilize when handling unpredictable and emotionally charged situations, it promotes better clarity of our motivations and goals, and it is an integral part of developing more satisfying relationships with others. 

EI is also a significant predictor of professional success, believed to account for 58% of performance in all types of jobs (Bradberry and Greaves, 2006).

Overall, EI has been found to subsume a variety of skills that are critical in our day-to-day life (Figure 1).

Increased sensitivity to the feelings of others allows more effective communication and prevents the escalation of tension and conflicts. 

As we are more aware of the emotional needs of the people we interact with, we are more likely to adopt a collaborative attitude and be open to compromise (Petrovici and Dobrescu, 2014).

Recognizing how specific situations can trigger stressful emotions can help us feel more in control of our reactions, replacing negative feelings with appropriate coping skills to deal with them. 

Neglecting how emotional stress drives our behaviors can lead to irrational decisions and ultimately exacerbate mental health outcomes (Ciarrochi, Deane, and Anderson, 2002).

Understanding how emotions influence our thoughts can prevent us from making misguided decisions, both in our personal lives and in the workplace. 

As we are able to identify emotions that are superfluous or unrelated to a problem, we can form more objective judgments and enhance the quality of decision-making (Hess and Bacigalupo, 2011).

Changes in our personal and professional life are constant and can sometimes be emotionally intense. 

Reflecting on the emotional reactions that make us resistant to change as well as the interpretations and preconceptions associated with them, can help us assume a more positive outlook and think more optimistically about opportunities that can derive from change (Lin et al., 2016).

With high EI, we can better understand the meaning of our aspirations and the motivational skills required to achieve goals in relation to our work, personal life, and health (Magnano, Craparo, and Paolillo, 2016). 

In addition, with the capacity to recognize emotions, we can also impact other people’s motivations, encouraging positive attitudes towards shared goals when working in teams.

Since EI is a skill that can be continuously developed and refined over time, it makes sense that our ability to deal with emotional challenges might increase with age. 

Indeed, research suggests that older adults are better able to balance emotions and cognition when problem-solving and making decisions compared to their younger counterparts. 

In addition, older adults seem to be better able to regulate emotions and minimize the intensity and duration of negative affect (Carstensen et al., 2000). 

At the same time, it is important to acknowledge that a person’s age does not always mirror their level of emotional maturity, and some EI competencies might require more consistent practice and training (Fariselli, Ghini, and Freedman, 2008).

Low EI manifests with difficulty dealing with our own feelings and relating to the emotional experiences of others (Goleman, 1996). 

Being emotionally disconnected may result in uncontrolled and impulsive behaviors, such as emotional outbursts, insensitive responses, or blaming others, all of which can compromise the quality of our relationships. 

Ignoring other people’s feelings can also increase the risk of conflicts if the conversations are too closed, self-centered and foster misunderstandings (Hansen, 2015). 

Ultimately, low EI may result in a reduction of a person’s social circle and level of emotional support, with detrimental effects on mental health and well-being.

Though IQ and EI are sometimes related, they represent two separate constructs that might present with different levels of development in the same person. 

Having a strong ability to analyze and interpret situations (often associated with a high IQ) does not necessarily translate into the ability to read other people’s emotions or attend to emotional cues. 

Similarly, the ability to find rational solutions to problems might not manifest in social situations where strong EI skills are needed to manage conflict and reach a compromise (Goleman, 2020).

Considering the increasingly important role of EI in academic and work success, as well as in managing stress and life transitions, there is a growing interest in teaching emotional intelligence to teenagers and students. 

In a classroom environment, incorporating training focused on enhancing assertive communication and managing negative self-talk can result in an improvement in EI skills (Chang, 2006). 

In addition, students who show the greatest benefit from EI programs are also more likely to persist with their studies in the future (Qualter et al., 2009). 

In practice, introducing behaviors in classrooms that are informed by EI principles, such as promoting collaboration between students and practicing self-reflection exercises, can help students gradually assimilate this skill.

Research shows that 90 percent of top performers are high in emotional intelligence.

Technical skills will only get you so far. If you’re an aspiring or current leader, you need to build your emotional intelligence to bring out the best in others and cultivate high-performing teams.

“Leaders prime the emotional state of the organization,” said Travis Bradberry, president of emotional intelligence provider TalentSmart, to the Society for Human Resource Management. “When they’re ineffective, when they set poor examples of how they treat other people, that trickles down throughout the company.”

Emotional intelligence, also known as emotional quotient or EQ, is the ability to understand and manage your emotions and the emotions of others. 

Similar to IQ, emotional intelligence can be measured through various assessments, but IQ represents cognitive abilities while EQ is a measure of one’s emotional capabilities. 

While emotional intelligence is beneficial for everyone, it’s especially important for those in leadership positions. Emotionally intelligent leaders can empathize with others, communicate effectively, and manage conflict. All of these abilities are qualities of effective leaders.

If you want to enhance your leadership capabilities, here are five emotional intelligence skills you need and ways you can develop them.

Self-awareness is having a clear understanding of your strengths, limitations, emotions, beliefs, and motivations. It sounds simple enough, yet 79 percent of executives surveyed by organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry had at least one blind spot—or a skill they ranked among their strongest that others reported as a weakness.

Leaders who are adept at recognizing and managing their emotions are better equipped to perceive others’ feelings and know how to motivate employees. Those who don’t could see a slip in performance: Research in the  Harvard Business Review found that teams with individuals who lack self-awareness make worse decisions and are less effective at conflict management.

By acknowledging your weaknesses, you can build trust and transparency among your team. You can also own your professional development by knowing the areas in which you need to improve in order to advance your career.

Self-regulation refers to how you manage your emotions, behaviors, and impulses. The more self-aware you are, the easier this becomes; if you can recognize what you’re feeling and why, you can respond appropriately.

“In my experience, I’ve never seen the tendency toward radical outbursts to surface as an indicator of strong leadership,” writes Daniel Goleman, the psychologist who popularized emotional intelligence, on his website.

If prone to emotional outbursts or overreacting, there are tactics you can use to improve your self-regulation, such as:

If you acknowledge your emotions and give yourself time to process them, you can carefully craft how you respond and avoid doing anything that could jeopardize the goodwill you’ve worked hard to build.

Empathy is the capability of understanding another person’s experiences and emotions, and has been ranked as the top leadership skill needed today by global consulting firm DDI. According to DDI's research, leaders who excel at listening and responding with empathy perform more than 40 percent higher in coaching, planning, and decision-making.

According to a separate survey by Businessolver, 96 percent of employees rank empathy as important, but 92 percent say it’s undervalued. It shouldn’t be, though: Companies that prioritize empathy experience an increase in revenue, retention, and productivity.

By actively listening to your employees and taking the time to understand their wants and needs, you can boost engagement, build trust, and more effectively coach them through challenges. The more your team feels appreciated, the more invested they’ll be, which, in turn, leads to higher morale and stronger company culture.

Motivation refers to your ability to inspire both yourself and others to action. Here, it’s essential to lead by example. Self-motivated leaders care more about hitting organizational milestones than monetary awards. They set goals, take initiative, rise to the challenge, and stay optimistic during turbulent times.

The more positive you are, the more confident your team will feel. Your intrinsic motivation will permeate the organization, and you’ll have a better understanding of how to empower employees.

Social skills are all about how you perceive emotions and interact and communicate with others. For example, emotionally intelligent leaders can walk into a room of employees with pursed lips and clenched fists and not only sense the tension, but know how to address and resolve the conflict before it escalates.

The more in tune you are with your emotions, the easier it will be to assess others’. And if you can assess others’ feelings, you can more easily build and maintain relationships. Leaders with strong social skills know they can’t achieve success alone. Surpassing goals and reaching milestones requires collaboration, communication, and a shared vision.

Related: How to Give Feedback Effectively

If you have gaps in your current skill set, there are actions you can take to boost your emotional intelligence. Methods include:

At the end of the workday, reflect on how your meetings, projects, and interactions went—whether positive or negative. By writing your thoughts down, you can spot specific patterns about your behaviors and reactions, as well as others’.

Where did you excel? How are your employees feeling? Are there certain people or situations that frustrated you and, if so, why? The more introspective you are, the better. For example, you’ll become more aware of what upsets you, so that you can avoid a future outburst, or mimic actions that have proven to boost employee morale.

In a 360-degree assessment, you solicit feedback from your manager, colleagues, and peers, while also undergoing an individual self-assessment. Through the process, you can gain valuable insights into what your co-workers perceive as your strengths and weaknesses, as well as uncover any blind spots you might have.

According to Jack Zenger, CEO of leadership development firm Zenger Folkman, more than 85 percent of all Fortune 500 companies use 360-degree feedback. It can help improve leaders’ self-awareness, which, in turn, can result in improved workplace effectiveness, less stress, and stronger relationships.

According to Psychology Today, only about 10 percent of people listen effectively. It’s easy to get distracted by technology, background noise, and your own thoughts. Yet, to be an effective communicator and emotionally intelligent leader, you need to be a good listener. 

To become more emotionally intelligent, practice active listening. Try to focus on what the speaker is saying and show that you’re engaged by paraphrasing and using other non-verbal cues like nodding. By actively listening at work, it will be easier to connect with others and truly understand their thoughts and feelings.

To understand the emotions of others, you need to understand your own first.

When you catch yourself feeling a particularly strong emotion, whether it’s a positive or negative one, make a conscious effort to think about what you’re feeling. Take a second and consider why you’re feeling this way and what might have triggered such a strong emotional response.

This will help you become more aware of your own emotions and better understand your colleagues’. As an empathetic leader, you’ll be able to cultivate a high-performing team.





If you’re interested in diving deeper into emotional intelligence and enhancing your leadership capabilities, taking an online leadership course or training could be the best next step.

Online courses offer working professionals the flexibility to complete coursework on their schedule and connect with a global community of like-minded peers, all while gaining new skills and knowledge.

One program to consider is Harvard Business School Online’s Leadership Principles course, which provides a 360-degree assessment to help you better understand who you are as a leader and how others perceive you.



Building your emotional intelligence skills can not only help you grow as a leader but enable you to motivate and coach teams more effectively.

          An overview of the importance of Emotional Intelligence for your own success and the success of your organization.
        

Blog

Today’s in-demand skills are increasingly technical in nature. However, there’s a corresponding need for the uniquely human ability to work with and through others to accomplish important goals.

Enter emotional intelligence (EI), a set of skills that help us recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions as well as recognize, understand and influence the emotions of others.

We recently spoke with Margaret Andrews, instructor of Emotional Intelligence in Leadership, about how people can build EI for better interpersonal relations. Andrews is the former associate dean at Harvard University’s Division of Continuing Education and executive director at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

“Emotional intelligence is critical in building and maintaining relationships and influencing others — key skills that help people throughout their career and wherever they sit in an organizational structure,” says Andrews.

Additionally, research suggests that people with a high emotional quotient (EQ) are more innovative and have higher job satisfaction than those with lower EQs.

Let’s dive into what exactly EI entails, and how you can improve on this essential component of successful relationships.

Emotional intelligence is a set of skills and behaviors. While some people will be naturally more adept at certain aspects, EI can be learned, developed, and enhanced.

The four main components of EI are self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness, and social skills:

Self-awareness is the ability to identify and understand your own emotions and the impact we have on others. It’s the cornerstone of emotional intelligence and the other components of EI depend on this self-awareness.

“It all starts with self-awareness, which is foundation of EI, and it builds from there. If you’re aware of your own emotions and the behaviors they trigger, you can begin to manage these emotions and behaviors,” says Andrews.

Our emotions impact our mood, behaviors, performance, and interactions with other people. “We are all having emotions all the time,” says Andrews, “the question is whether you are aware of these emotions and the impact they have on your behavior — and other people.”

According to Tasha Eurich, an organizational psychologist, researcher, and author of Insight, people who are self-aware tend to be more confident and more creative. They also make better decisions, build stronger relationships, and communicate more effectively.

Self-awareness opens the door to self-regulation, which is the ability to manage these emotions and behaviors. Once we’re aware of our emotions, we can begin to manage them and keep the disruptive emotions and impulses under control.

“People with strong self-regulation can pause and take a deep breath in tense and stressful situations, explains Andrews, “which helps them remain calm and think before they speak or act.”

These people tend toward a positive outlook and are adaptable to a variety of situations and circumstances. “On the flip side,” she says, “those that cannot contain their negative emotions and impulses often set off a chain reaction of negative emotions in others.”

“There’s an old adage that people join organizations and leave managers,” says Andrews, “and it’s true. So, companies — or managers — that have high turnover rates should take a look in the mirror.”

Social awareness is our ability to understand the emotions of others and a key component of this is empathy.

Jamil Zaki, a Stanford professor and author of The War for Kindness, describes empathy as having three components — identifying what others feel, sharing this emotion, and wishing to improve their experience.

“It’s not about how you would feel in their situation, but rather, how they actually feel,” says Andrews.

People with strong social awareness tend toward kindness. However, this doesn’t mean they cannot give others difficult feedback — in fact, they may be better at delivering this ‘tough love’ because they understand the other person and want to help them improve.

“Social skills are what separate a great manager from a good one,” says Andrews.

These skills, which include influence, conflict management, teamwork, and the ability to inspire others, make it possible to build and maintain healthy relationships in all parts of your life.

People with strong social skills can make an enormous difference on a team and in organizations because they understand others and act on this knowledge to move people toward a common goal.

To improve your emotional intelligence, you need to start at the beginning, with self-awareness. However, gauging your self-awareness is innately difficult because, as Andrews puts it, “you don’t know what you don’t know.”

Without an objective sense of who you are and what drives you, it’s nearly impossible to be emotionally intelligent. Andrews cites a study by Tasha Eurich which found that 95 percent of participants gave themselves high marks in self-awareness.

However, using more empirical measures of self-awareness, the study found that only 10-15 percent of the cohort was truly self-aware.

That’s a pretty big gap, and one that suggests most of us aren’t very self-aware. What’s worse, research also shows that managers and CEOs may be the least self-aware of all. This is not despite their authority, but quite possibly because of it.

Eurich wrote in the Harvard Business Review that the more power someone obtains, the more likely they are to be overconfident about how well they know themselves. After all, those at the top of the chain have fewer people giving them feedback.

Often, when managers do receive feedback from employees, it isn’t as honest as it might be because subordinates are afraid of incurring negative consequences. Managers are insulated from criticism, and as a result, self-awareness sinks.

Receiving honest, constructive feedback is key to becoming self-aware. Andrews notes that a 360-degree emotional intelligence assessment can be a very effective way to gain insight into your EI-components and the impact you have on others.

“Many people shrug off differences in how they rate themselves versus how others rate them on EI competencies by saying that they’re too hard on themselves or that others don’t really understand their intent,” says Andrews, “but really it shows a lack of self-awareness.”

Emotional intelligence is a set of skills and behaviors that can be learned and developed. Here are some telltale signs of people with low EQ and those with high EQ.

People with low EQ:

People with high EQ:

Developing emotional intelligence is an ongoing process. The journey differs from person to person. Nonetheless, according to Andrews, the following actions may lead you to better self-awareness, empathy, and social skills.

What emotions are you feeling right now? Can you name them? When in a stressful situation, what emotions typically arise? How would you like to respond in these situations? Can you stop to pause and reconsider your response? Taking a moment to name your feelings and temper your reactivity is an integral step toward EI.

Audit your self-perception by asking managers, colleagues, friends, or family how they would rate your emotional intelligence. For example, ask them about how you respond to difficult situations, how adaptable or empathetic you are, and/or how well you handle conflict. It may not always be what you want to hear, but it will often be what you need to hear.

Studies show that reading literature with complex characters can improve empathy. Reading stories from other people’s perspectives helps us gain insight into their thoughts, motivations, and actions and may help enhance your social awareness.

Building E.I. in yourself is one thing, but influencing others to adopt a more empathetic mindset can be a challenge. To create a culture of high EQ, managers and supervisors must model emotionally intelligent behavior.

“If you want to change how your organization does in EI, you can set norms for how people communicate and how they disagree,” says Andrews.

In addition, you need to recognize and celebrate those that exhibit emotional intelligence.;

“Start making heroes of people who help other people,” says Andrews. “It’s not just the person who got to the top of the mountain first — it’s all the people who helped them. If you want to encourage good team behavior, recognize it, and call it out for what it is.”

        Emotional Intelligence


Emotional intelligence fuels your performance both in the workplace and in your personal life, but it starts with you. From your confidence, empathy and optimism to your social skills and self-control, understanding and managing your own emotions can accelerate success in all areas of your life.

No matter what professional field you are in, whether you manage a team of two or 20, or even just yourself, realising how effective you are at controlling your own emotional energy is a great starting point. Absent from the curriculum, emotional intelligence isn’t something we are taught or tested on, so where did it come from, what is it, do you have it and is it really that important?

Fortunately, it is something you can learn and we’ve compiled a comprehensive list of tips to help you explore your own level of emotional intelligence and gain important emotional intelligence skills that can be implemented into everyday life. Some of these tips we follow ourselves and others have been revealed to us by our amazing clients and partners who know how to motivate and inspire their teams but first and foremost, themselves.

1. Emotional Intelligence2. Self-awareness3. Self-management4. Motivation5. Empathy6. Social skills7. What to avoid

 

Put simply, Emotional Intelligence is how well individuals identify and manage their own emotions and react to the emotions of others. It’s understanding how those emotions shape your thoughts and actions so you can have greater control over your behaviour and develop the skills to manage yourself more effectively. Becoming more emotionally conscious allows us to grow and gain a deeper understanding of who we are, enabling us to communicate better with others and build stronger relationships.

We suggest starting with these initial 8 tips, they provide a good starting point to discovering the foundations of your emotional intelligence.

#1) Practice observing how you feelOften we lead hectic, busy lifestyles and it’s all too easy for us to lose touch with our emotions. To reconnect, try setting a timer for various points during the day. When the timer goes off, take a few deep breaths and notice how you’re feeling emotionally. Pay attention to where that emotion is showing up as a physical feeling in your body and what the sensation feels like. The more you practice, the more it will become second nature.

#2) Pay attention to how you behaveWhile you’re practising your emotional awareness, take the time to notice your behaviour too. Observe how you act when you’re experiencing certain emotions, and how that affects your day-to-day life. Managing our emotions becomes easier once we become more conscious of how we react to them.

#3) Question your own opinionsIn this hyper-connected world, it is easy to fall into an ‘opinion bubble’. This is a state of existence where your own opinions are constantly re-enforced by people with similar viewpoints. Take time to read the other side of the story and have your views challenged (even if you still feel they are right). This will help you understand other people and be more receptive to new ideas.

#4) Take responsibility for your feelingsYour emotions and behaviour come from you, they don’t come from anyone else and once you start accepting responsibility for how you feel and how you behave it will have a positive impact on all areas of your life.



#5) Take time to celebrate the positiveA key part emotional intelligence is celebrating and reflecting on the positive moments in life. People who experience positive emotions are generally more resilient and more likely to have fulfilling relationships, which will help them move past adversity.

#6) But don’t ignore the negative

Reflecting on negative feelings is just as important as reflecting on the positive. Understanding why you feel negative is key to becoming a fully-rounded individual, who is more able to deal with negative issues in the future.

#7) Don’t forget to breathe

Life throws various situations our way, with most of us experiencing some sort of stress on a regular basis. To manage your emotions when this happens and to avoid outbursts, don’t forget to breathe. Call a time out and go put some cold water on your face, go outside and get some fresh air or make a drink – anything to keep your cool and give yourself a chance to get a hold on what’s happening and how you should respond.

#8) A lifetime processUnderstand and remember that emotional intelligence is something you develop and requires continual improvement; it’s very much a lifetime practice.

A key component of emotional intelligence, self-awareness is the ability to recognise and understand your own character, moods and emotions and their effect on others. It includes a realistic self-assessment of what you’re capable of – your strengths and weaknesses – and knowing how others perceive you. It can help highlight areas for self-improvement, make you better at adapting and can limit wrongful decisions.

#9) Learn to look at yourself objectivelyKnowing yourself completely is difficult and it’s almost impossible to look at yourself objectively, so input from those who know you is vital. Ask them where your strengths and weaknesses lie, write down what they say and compare it. Look out for any patterns and remember not to argue with them – it doesn’t mean they’re right – they’re just trying to help you gauge your perception from another’s point of view.

#10) Keep a diaryA great way to get an accurate gauge of yourself is to keep a diary. Start by writing down what happened to you at the end of every day, how it made you feel and how you dealt with it. Documenting details like these will make you more aware of what you’re doing and will highlight where problems might be coming from. Periodically, look back over your comments and take note of any trends.

#11) Understand what motivates youEveryone has a core motivation when they begin a project. The difficulty is keeping this driving force in mind when adversity appears. All too often people start a project but fail to complete it because they lose their motivation to do so. Take time to understand what motivates you and use it to push you across the finish line.

#12) Take it easy

Sometimes emotional outbreaks occur because we don’t take the time out to slow down and process how we’re feeling. Give yourself a break and make a conscious effort to meditate, do yoga or read – a little escapism works wonders. And then the next time you have an emotional reaction to something, try to pause before you react.

#13) Acknowledge your emotional triggers

Self-aware individuals are able to recognise their emotions as they occur. It’s important to be flexible with your emotions and adapt them to your situation. Don’t deny your emotions stage time but don’t be rigid with them either, take the time to process your emotions before communicating them.

#14) Predict how you will feelThink about a situation you’re going into and predict how you will feel. Practice naming and accepting the feelings – naming the feeling puts you in control. Try to choose an appropriate reaction to the feeling rather than just reacting to it.



#15) Trust your intuitionIf you are still unsure about which path to take, trust your intuition. After all, your subconscious has been learning which path to take throughout your entire life.

Once you’ve gotten to grips with self-awareness and how your emotions work, you can get a handle on self-management. Which means taking responsibility for your own behaviour and well-being as well as controlling emotional outbursts.

#16) Snap out of itOne key way to keep your emotions in check is to change your sensory input – motion dictates emotion as the old saying goes. So jolt your physical body out of routine by attending an exercise class or try channelling a busy mind with a puzzle or a book – anything to break your existing routine.

#17) Maintain a schedule (and stick to it!)Ensuring that you create a schedule and stick to it is extremely important if you want to complete tasks effectively.

Paul Minors of Productivityist writes “When you schedule appointments in your calendar, you’re saying to yourself: “I’m going to do A, B and C by X date and it’s going to take Y hours. Once you make this promise, it becomes harder to procrastinate.”

#18) Eat well

This sounds like an easy one but regulating what you eat and drink can have a massive effect on your emotional state, so try your best to maintain a balanced diet.

#19) Don’t get mad

Funnel your emotional energy into something productive. It’s okay to keep overwhelming emotions inside, especially if it’s not an appropriate time to let them out. However, when you do, rather than vent it on something futile, turn it into motivation instead. Don’t get mad, get better.

#20) Be interestedA key factor in managing yourself and your emotions is consciously taken the time to be interested in the subject matter, whether it be business or personal.

#21) Don’t expect people to trust you (if you can’t trust them)

Establishing trust with a person can be difficult, and once it’s lost it’s very hard to regain. Try to be mindful that people are only human and will make mistakes. By offering your trust, you are inviting people to offer their trust in return.

#22) It’s your choiceYou have the ability to choose how you react to a situation – you can either overreact or remain calm. But it’s your choice.

A personal skills aspect of emotional intelligence, self-motivation refers to our inner drive to achieve and improve our commitment to our goals, our readiness to act on opportunities and our overall optimism.

#23) Personal goalsPersonal goals can provide long-term direction and short-term motivation. So grab a pen and paper and have a think about where you want to be and set some targets for yourself. Base them on your strengths and make them relevant to you and ultimately, make them exciting and achievable. This task alone is enough to get you instantly motivated!

#24) Be realisticWhen you’ve set a new goal, be sure to give yourself realistic and clear aims to achieving that goal and understand that change is an inevitable part of life. Achievement boosts confidence and as self-confidence rises so does the ability to achieve more, see how it works?

#25) Positive thinkingTo keep motivated it’s important to maintain a positive and optimistic mindset. See problems and setbacks as learning opportunities instead of failings and try to avoid negative people and opt to surround yourself with positive, well-motivated people – they’ll have a great effect on you.



#26) Lifelong learningBoth knowledge and information are key for feeding your mind and keeping you curious and motivated. And with information so easily accessible, you have the opportunity to fuel your values and passions at the click of a button!

#27) Be prepared to leave your comfort zoneThe biggest barrier to achieving your full potential is not challenging yourself frequently enough. Great things can happen to you if you’re willing to leave your comfort zone, so do so as often as you can.

#28) Help

Don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it, and vice versa. If others need help, don’t hold back in giving it to them. Seeing other people succeed will only help to motivate yourself.

#29) Stand and stretchFor an instant short term boost to your motivation, take a stand and stretch out as far as you can for 10 seconds. When you return to your desk, you’ll be in the correct frame of mind and ready to work.

Quite simply, empathy is the ability to understand other people’s emotions. Understanding that everyone has their own set of feelings, desires, triggers and fears. To be empathetic you’re allowing their experiences to resonate with your own in order to respond in an emotionally appropriate way. It’s a lifelong skill and the most important one for navigating relationships, and whilst it may not come naturally, there are a few ways it can be nurtured.

#30) Listen

Before you’re able to empathise with someone you first need to understand what it is they’re saying, which means listening is at the very epicentre of empathy. It involves letting them talk without interruption, preconceptions, scepticism and putting your own issues on pause to allow yourself to absorb their situation and consider how they are feeling before you react.

#31) Try to be approachableWhether you’re the leader of a team or working on a project with others, try to remain accessible and approachable.

#32) PerspectiveWe’re all familiar with the phrase “put yourself in their shoes”, and this is exactly that. The simplest way of gaining a little perspective the next time an issue or situation arises is to switch places with the other person and really think about what’s happening from their point of view. Sometimes there’s no right or wrong but at least you’ll understand enough to come to a resolve or offer some useful advice.

#33) Open yourself upOne of the quickest ways to offer a sincere exchange or sign of empathy is to listen to someone’s experiences and connect to it with a similar experience of your own. Don’t be afraid to open yourself up, it might just be the start of a great and lasting friendship.



#34) Immerse yourself in a new cultureThe old saying ‘travel broadens the mind’ is still true, even in this ever shrinking world. Sometimes the best way to open your mind is to jump on a plane and go somewhere completely different.

#35) Cultivate a curiosity about strangers

Highly empathetic people have an insatiable curiosity about strangers. When we talk to people outside of our usual social circle we learn about and begin to understand opinions, views and lives that are different to our own. So next time you’re sat on a bus you know just what to do…

#36) Acknowledge what people are sayingAnother useful tip is, whilst listening to what a person has to say, use acknowledgement words such as ‘I understand’ and ‘I see’ to show a person you’re listening (but of course only say these things if you are actually listening!).

In emotional intelligence terms, social skills refer to the skills needed to handle and influence other people’s emotions effectively. It covers a wide range of abilities, from communication and conflict management to dealing with change, meeting new people and building relationships and plays a part in almost every part of our lives, from work life to our romantic life. It’s complex and requires utilising almost every point we have already mentioned, but here are a few pointers for you.

#37) Get startedA good way to get started on improving your social skills is to isolate one skill you know you’d like to develop, this narrows it down and gives you focus. Internationally known psychologist, Daniel Goleman, suggests highlighting someone you know to be good at that particular skill, observing how they act and how they control their emotions and then implementing and applying that knowledge to yourself.

#38) Wear somebody else’s shoesNot literally of course! Everyone has heard the phrase ‘walk a mile in somebody else’s shoes’, but how many people actually practice this advice? Give it a try, you never know.

#39) Practice makes perfectThe idea of practising your social skills might sound strange, but like everything in life, practice makes perfect.

#40) Social media cold turkeyWe don’t mean to sound old, but taking your social life offline and engaging face-to-face with people will open up so many opportunities for you to gain and develop your social skills. So next time instead of instant messaging your best friend, meet up for a drink! Emotional intelligence doesn’t expand within the confines of (un) social media…

#41) Get networkingA good way to practise your social acumen is to attend local networking events. The great thing about these events is that everyone attending has a shared reason for attending.

#42) It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it

We’re talking about the importance of nonverbal communication and how that can affect a person’s opinion of you. Body language, tone of voice and eye contact is key to letting others know how you feel emotionally. So once you’ve got your emotions intact, think about how you’re physically coming across.

#43) The unknownThe ultimate method to building your social skills is to get out there and be sociable. It sounds simple, but you can’t strengthen your social skills without being social! Join a group or network outside of your usual circle; it’s the perfect way to put all of our tips into play.

Those with a high EQ very rarely display the following traits, something for you to be mindful of.

#44) DramaEmotionally intelligent people listen, offer sound advice and extend empathy to those who need it but they don’t permit others’ lives and emotions to effect or rule their own.

#45) ComplainingComplaining implies two things – one, that we are victims, and two, that there are no solutions to our problems. Rarely does an emotionally intelligent person feel victimised, and even more infrequently do they feel that a solution is beyond their grasp. So instead of looking for someone or something to blame, they think constructively and dissolve the solution in private.



#46) NegativityEmotionally intelligent people have the ability to kerb cynical thoughts. They acknowledge that negative thoughts are just that – thoughts – and rely on facts to come to conclusions as well as being able to silence or zone out any negativity.

#47) Dwelling on the pastThose with high emotional intelligence choose to learn from the mistakes and choices they have made and instead of dwelling on the past are mindful to live in the now.

#48) SelfishnessWhilst a degree of selfishness is required to get ahead in life, too much can fracture relationships and cause disharmony. Try to avoid being overly selfish and consider others needs.

#49) Giving in to peer pressureJust because everyone else does something, they don’t feel compelled to follow suit if they don’t want to. They think independently, and never conform just to please other people.

#50) Being overly criticalNothing destroys a person’s morale faster than being overly critical. Remember that people are only human and have the same motivations (and limitations) as you. Take the time to understand another person then communicate the change you want to see.

By understanding and successfully applying emotional intelligence, you too can reach your full potential and achieve your goals.

Harvard Business School Online's Business Insights Blog provides the career insights you need to achieve your goals and gain confidence in your business skills.

Emotional intelligence is a crucial component of leadership. Your ability to manage your emotions, as well as recognize and influence others’, has been considered one of the strongest indicators of workplace performance. Research shows that 90 percent of top performers are high in emotional intelligence.

Technical skills will only get you so far. If you’re an aspiring or current leader, you need to build your emotional intelligence to bring out the best in others and cultivate high-performing teams.

“Leaders prime the emotional state of the organization,” said Travis Bradberry, president of emotional intelligence provider TalentSmart, to the Society for Human Resource Management. “When they’re ineffective, when they set poor examples of how they treat other people, that trickles down throughout the company.”

Emotional intelligence, also known as emotional quotient or EQ, is the ability to understand and manage your emotions and the emotions of others. 

Similar to IQ, emotional intelligence can be measured through various assessments, but IQ represents cognitive abilities while EQ is a measure of one’s emotional capabilities. 

While emotional intelligence is beneficial for everyone, it’s especially important for those in leadership positions. Emotionally intelligent leaders can empathize with others, communicate effectively, and manage conflict. All of these abilities are qualities of effective leaders.

If you want to enhance your leadership capabilities, here are five emotional intelligence skills you need and ways you can develop them.

Access your free e-book today.

Self-awareness is having a clear understanding of your strengths, limitations, emotions, beliefs, and motivations. It sounds simple enough, yet 79 percent of executives surveyed by organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry had at least one blind spot—or a skill they ranked among their strongest that others reported as a weakness.

Leaders who are adept at recognizing and managing their emotions are better equipped to perceive others’ feelings and know how to motivate employees. Those who don’t could see a slip in performance: Research in the  Harvard Business Review found that teams with individuals who lack self-awareness make worse decisions and are less effective at conflict management.

By acknowledging your weaknesses, you can build trust and transparency among your team. You can also own your professional development by knowing the areas in which you need to improve in order to advance your career.

Self-regulation refers to how you manage your emotions, behaviors, and impulses. The more self-aware you are, the easier this becomes; if you can recognize what you’re feeling and why, you can respond appropriately.

“In my experience, I’ve never seen the tendency toward radical outbursts to surface as an indicator of strong leadership,” writes Daniel Goleman, the psychologist who popularized emotional intelligence, on his website.

If prone to emotional outbursts or overreacting, there are tactics you can use to improve your self-regulation, such as:

If you acknowledge your emotions and give yourself time to process them, you can carefully craft how you respond and avoid doing anything that could jeopardize the goodwill you’ve worked hard to build.

Empathy is the capability of understanding another person’s experiences and emotions, and has been ranked as the top leadership skill needed today by global consulting firm DDI. According to DDI's research, leaders who excel at listening and responding with empathy perform more than 40 percent higher in coaching, planning, and decision-making.

According to a separate survey by Businessolver, 96 percent of employees rank empathy as important, but 92 percent say it’s undervalued. It shouldn’t be, though: Companies that prioritize empathy experience an increase in revenue, retention, and productivity.

By actively listening to your employees and taking the time to understand their wants and needs, you can boost engagement, build trust, and more effectively coach them through challenges. The more your team feels appreciated, the more invested they’ll be, which, in turn, leads to higher morale and stronger company culture.

Motivation refers to your ability to inspire both yourself and others to action. Here, it’s essential to lead by example. Self-motivated leaders care more about hitting organizational milestones than monetary awards. They set goals, take initiative, rise to the challenge, and stay optimistic during turbulent times.

The more positive you are, the more confident your team will feel. Your intrinsic motivation will permeate the organization, and you’ll have a better understanding of how to empower employees.

Social skills are all about how you perceive emotions and interact and communicate with others. For example, emotionally intelligent leaders can walk into a room of employees with pursed lips and clenched fists and not only sense the tension, but know how to address and resolve the conflict before it escalates.

The more in tune you are with your emotions, the easier it will be to assess others’. And if you can assess others’ feelings, you can more easily build and maintain relationships. Leaders with strong social skills know they can’t achieve success alone. Surpassing goals and reaching milestones requires collaboration, communication, and a shared vision.

Related: How to Give Feedback Effectively

If you have gaps in your current skill set, there are actions you can take to boost your emotional intelligence. Methods include:

At the end of the workday, reflect on how your meetings, projects, and interactions went—whether positive or negative. By writing your thoughts down, you can spot specific patterns about your behaviors and reactions, as well as others’.

Where did you excel? How are your employees feeling? Are there certain people or situations that frustrated you and, if so, why? The more introspective you are, the better. For example, you’ll become more aware of what upsets you, so that you can avoid a future outburst, or mimic actions that have proven to boost employee morale.

In a 360-degree assessment, you solicit feedback from your manager, colleagues, and peers, while also undergoing an individual self-assessment. Through the process, you can gain valuable insights into what your co-workers perceive as your strengths and weaknesses, as well as uncover any blind spots you might have.

According to Jack Zenger, CEO of leadership development firm Zenger Folkman, more than 85 percent of all Fortune 500 companies use 360-degree feedback. It can help improve leaders’ self-awareness, which, in turn, can result in improved workplace effectiveness, less stress, and stronger relationships.

According to Psychology Today, only about 10 percent of people listen effectively. It’s easy to get distracted by technology, background noise, and your own thoughts. Yet, to be an effective communicator and emotionally intelligent leader, you need to be a good listener. 

To become more emotionally intelligent, practice active listening. Try to focus on what the speaker is saying and show that you’re engaged by paraphrasing and using other non-verbal cues like nodding. By actively listening at work, it will be easier to connect with others and truly understand their thoughts and feelings.

To understand the emotions of others, you need to understand your own first.

When you catch yourself feeling a particularly strong emotion, whether it’s a positive or negative one, make a conscious effort to think about what you’re feeling. Take a second and consider why you’re feeling this way and what might have triggered such a strong emotional response.

This will help you become more aware of your own emotions and better understand your colleagues’. As an empathetic leader, you’ll be able to cultivate a high-performing team.





If you’re interested in diving deeper into emotional intelligence and enhancing your leadership capabilities, taking an online leadership course or training could be the best next step.

Online courses offer working professionals the flexibility to complete coursework on their schedule and connect with a global community of like-minded peers, all while gaining new skills and knowledge.

One program to consider is Harvard Business School Online’s Leadership Principles course, which provides a 360-degree assessment to help you better understand who you are as a leader and how others perceive you.



Building your emotional intelligence skills can not only help you grow as a leader but enable you to motivate and coach teams more effectively. In turn, you can make a greater impact on your organization by boosting morale, productivity, and communication—enabling you to advance your business and career simultaneously.

          An overview of the importance of Emotional Intelligence for your own success and the success of your organization.
        

Blog

Today’s in-demand skills are increasingly technical in nature. However, there’s a corresponding need for the uniquely human ability to work with and through others to accomplish important goals.

Enter emotional intelligence (EI), a set of skills that help us recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions as well as recognize, understand and influence the emotions of others.

We recently spoke with Margaret Andrews, instructor of Emotional Intelligence in Leadership, about how people can build EI for better interpersonal relations. Andrews is the former associate dean at Harvard University’s Division of Continuing Education and executive director at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

“Emotional intelligence is critical in building and maintaining relationships and influencing others — key skills that help people throughout their career and wherever they sit in an organizational structure,” says Andrews.

Additionally, research suggests that people with a high emotional quotient (EQ) are more innovative and have higher job satisfaction than those with lower EQs.

Let’s dive into what exactly EI entails, and how you can improve on this essential component of successful relationships.

Emotional intelligence is a set of skills and behaviors. While some people will be naturally more adept at certain aspects, EI can be learned, developed, and enhanced.

The four main components of EI are self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness, and social skills:

Self-awareness is the ability to identify and understand your own emotions and the impact we have on others. It’s the cornerstone of emotional intelligence and the other components of EI depend on this self-awareness.

“It all starts with self-awareness, which is foundation of EI, and it builds from there. If you’re aware of your own emotions and the behaviors they trigger, you can begin to manage these emotions and behaviors,” says Andrews.

Our emotions impact our mood, behaviors, performance, and interactions with other people. “We are all having emotions all the time,” says Andrews, “the question is whether you are aware of these emotions and the impact they have on your behavior — and other people.”

According to Tasha Eurich, an organizational psychologist, researcher, and author of Insight, people who are self-aware tend to be more confident and more creative. They also make better decisions, build stronger relationships, and communicate more effectively.

Self-awareness opens the door to self-regulation, which is the ability to manage these emotions and behaviors. Once we’re aware of our emotions, we can begin to manage them and keep the disruptive emotions and impulses under control.

“People with strong self-regulation can pause and take a deep breath in tense and stressful situations, explains Andrews, “which helps them remain calm and think before they speak or act.”

These people tend toward a positive outlook and are adaptable to a variety of situations and circumstances. “On the flip side,” she says, “those that cannot contain their negative emotions and impulses often set off a chain reaction of negative emotions in others.”

“There’s an old adage that people join organizations and leave managers,” says Andrews, “and it’s true. So, companies — or managers — that have high turnover rates should take a look in the mirror.”

Social awareness is our ability to understand the emotions of others and a key component of this is empathy.

Jamil Zaki, a Stanford professor and author of The War for Kindness, describes empathy as having three components — identifying what others feel, sharing this emotion, and wishing to improve their experience.

“It’s not about how you would feel in their situation, but rather, how they actually feel,” says Andrews.

People with strong social awareness tend toward kindness. However, this doesn’t mean they cannot give others difficult feedback — in fact, they may be better at delivering this ‘tough love’ because they understand the other person and want to help them improve.

“Social skills are what separate a great manager from a good one,” says Andrews.

These skills, which include influence, conflict management, teamwork, and the ability to inspire others, make it possible to build and maintain healthy relationships in all parts of your life.

People with strong social skills can make an enormous difference on a team and in organizations because they understand others and act on this knowledge to move people toward a common goal.

To improve your emotional intelligence, you need to start at the beginning, with self-awareness. However, gauging your self-awareness is innately difficult because, as Andrews puts it, “you don’t know what you don’t know.”

Without an objective sense of who you are and what drives you, it’s nearly impossible to be emotionally intelligent. Andrews cites a study by Tasha Eurich which found that 95 percent of participants gave themselves high marks in self-awareness.

However, using more empirical measures of self-awareness, the study found that only 10-15 percent of the cohort was truly self-aware.

That’s a pretty big gap, and one that suggests most of us aren’t very self-aware. What’s worse, research also shows that managers and CEOs may be the least self-aware of all. This is not despite their authority, but quite possibly because of it.

Eurich wrote in the Harvard Business Review that the more power someone obtains, the more likely they are to be overconfident about how well they know themselves. After all, those at the top of the chain have fewer people giving them feedback.

Often, when managers do receive feedback from employees, it isn’t as honest as it might be because subordinates are afraid of incurring negative consequences. Managers are insulated from criticism, and as a result, self-awareness sinks.

Receiving honest, constructive feedback is key to becoming self-aware. Andrews notes that a 360-degree emotional intelligence assessment can be a very effective way to gain insight into your EI-components and the impact you have on others.

“Many people shrug off differences in how they rate themselves versus how others rate them on EI competencies by saying that they’re too hard on themselves or that others don’t really understand their intent,” says Andrews, “but really it shows a lack of self-awareness.”

Emotional intelligence is a set of skills and behaviors that can be learned and developed. Here are some telltale signs of people with low EQ and those with high EQ.

People with low EQ:

People with high EQ:

Developing emotional intelligence is an ongoing process. The journey differs from person to person. Nonetheless, according to Andrews, the following actions may lead you to better self-awareness, empathy, and social skills.

What emotions are you feeling right now? Can you name them? When in a stressful situation, what emotions typically arise? How would you like to respond in these situations? Can you stop to pause and reconsider your response? Taking a moment to name your feelings and temper your reactivity is an integral step toward EI.

Audit your self-perception by asking managers, colleagues, friends, or family how they would rate your emotional intelligence. For example, ask them about how you respond to difficult situations, how adaptable or empathetic you are, and/or how well you handle conflict. It may not always be what you want to hear, but it will often be what you need to hear.

Studies show that reading literature with complex characters can improve empathy. Reading stories from other people’s perspectives helps us gain insight into their thoughts, motivations, and actions and may help enhance your social awareness.

Building E.I. in yourself is one thing, but influencing others to adopt a more empathetic mindset can be a challenge. To create a culture of high EQ, managers and supervisors must model emotionally intelligent behavior.

“If you want to change how your organization does in EI, you can set norms for how people communicate and how they disagree,” says Andrews.

In addition, you need to recognize and celebrate those that exhibit emotional intelligence.;

“Start making heroes of people who help other people,” says Andrews. “It’s not just the person who got to the top of the mountain first — it’s all the people who helped them. If you want to encourage good team behavior, recognize it, and call it out for what it is.”

        Emotional Intelligence


Emotional intelligence fuels your performance both in the workplace and in your personal life, but it starts with you. From your confidence, empathy and optimism to your social skills and self-control, understanding and managing your own emotions can accelerate success in all areas of your life.

No matter what professional field you are in, whether you manage a team of two or 20, or even just yourself, realising how effective you are at controlling your own emotional energy is a great starting point. Absent from the curriculum, emotional intelligence isn’t something we are taught or tested on, so where did it come from, what is it, do you have it and is it really that important?

Fortunately, it is something you can learn and we’ve compiled a comprehensive list of tips to help you explore your own level of emotional intelligence and gain important emotional intelligence skills that can be implemented into everyday life. Some of these tips we follow ourselves and others have been revealed to us by our amazing clients and partners who know how to motivate and inspire their teams but first and foremost, themselves.

1. Emotional Intelligence2. Self-awareness3. Self-management4. Motivation5. Empathy6. Social skills7. What to avoid

 

Put simply, Emotional Intelligence is how well individuals identify and manage their own emotions and react to the emotions of others. It’s understanding how those emotions shape your thoughts and actions so you can have greater control over your behaviour and develop the skills to manage yourself more effectively. Becoming more emotionally conscious allows us to grow and gain a deeper understanding of who we are, enabling us to communicate better with others and build stronger relationships.

We suggest starting with these initial 8 tips, they provide a good starting point to discovering the foundations of your emotional intelligence.

#1) Practice observing how you feelOften we lead hectic, busy lifestyles and it’s all too easy for us to lose touch with our emotions. To reconnect, try setting a timer for various points during the day. When the timer goes off, take a few deep breaths and notice how you’re feeling emotionally. Pay attention to where that emotion is showing up as a physical feeling in your body and what the sensation feels like. The more you practice, the more it will become second nature.

#2) Pay attention to how you behaveWhile you’re practising your emotional awareness, take the time to notice your behaviour too. Observe how you act when you’re experiencing certain emotions, and how that affects your day-to-day life. Managing our emotions becomes easier once we become more conscious of how we react to them.

#3) Question your own opinionsIn this hyper-connected world, it is easy to fall into an ‘opinion bubble’. This is a state of existence where your own opinions are constantly re-enforced by people with similar viewpoints. Take time to read the other side of the story and have your views challenged (even if you still feel they are right). This will help you understand other people and be more receptive to new ideas.

#4) Take responsibility for your feelingsYour emotions and behaviour come from you, they don’t come from anyone else and once you start accepting responsibility for how you feel and how you behave it will have a positive impact on all areas of your life.



#5) Take time to celebrate the positiveA key part emotional intelligence is celebrating and reflecting on the positive moments in life. People who experience positive emotions are generally more resilient and more likely to have fulfilling relationships, which will help them move past adversity.

#6) But don’t ignore the negative

Reflecting on negative feelings is just as important as reflecting on the positive. Understanding why you feel negative is key to becoming a fully-rounded individual, who is more able to deal with negative issues in the future.

#7) Don’t forget to breathe

Life throws various situations our way, with most of us experiencing some sort of stress on a regular basis. To manage your emotions when this happens and to avoid outbursts, don’t forget to breathe. Call a time out and go put some cold water on your face, go outside and get some fresh air or make a drink – anything to keep your cool and give yourself a chance to get a hold on what’s happening and how you should respond.

#8) A lifetime processUnderstand and remember that emotional intelligence is something you develop and requires continual improvement; it’s very much a lifetime practice.

A key component of emotional intelligence, self-awareness is the ability to recognise and understand your own character, moods and emotions and their effect on others. It includes a realistic self-assessment of what you’re capable of – your strengths and weaknesses – and knowing how others perceive you. It can help highlight areas for self-improvement, make you better at adapting and can limit wrongful decisions.

#9) Learn to look at yourself objectivelyKnowing yourself completely is difficult and it’s almost impossible to look at yourself objectively, so input from those who know you is vital. Ask them where your strengths and weaknesses lie, write down what they say and compare it. Look out for any patterns and remember not to argue with them – it doesn’t mean they’re right – they’re just trying to help you gauge your perception from another’s point of view.

#10) Keep a diaryA great way to get an accurate gauge of yourself is to keep a diary. Start by writing down what happened to you at the end of every day, how it made you feel and how you dealt with it. Documenting details like these will make you more aware of what you’re doing and will highlight where problems might be coming from. Periodically, look back over your comments and take note of any trends.

#11) Understand what motivates youEveryone has a core motivation when they begin a project. The difficulty is keeping this driving force in mind when adversity appears. All too often people start a project but fail to complete it because they lose their motivation to do so. Take time to understand what motivates you and use it to push you across the finish line.

#12) Take it easy

Sometimes emotional outbreaks occur because we don’t take the time out to slow down and process how we’re feeling. Give yourself a break and make a conscious effort to meditate, do yoga or read – a little escapism works wonders. And then the next time you have an emotional reaction to something, try to pause before you react.

#13) Acknowledge your emotional triggers

Self-aware individuals are able to recognise their emotions as they occur. It’s important to be flexible with your emotions and adapt them to your situation. Don’t deny your emotions stage time but don’t be rigid with them either, take the time to process your emotions before communicating them.

#14) Predict how you will feelThink about a situation you’re going into and predict how you will feel. Practice naming and accepting the feelings – naming the feeling puts you in control. Try to choose an appropriate reaction to the feeling rather than just reacting to it.



#15) Trust your intuitionIf you are still unsure about which path to take, trust your intuition. After all, your subconscious has been learning which path to take throughout your entire life.

Once you’ve gotten to grips with self-awareness and how your emotions work, you can get a handle on self-management. Which means taking responsibility for your own behaviour and well-being as well as controlling emotional outbursts.

#16) Snap out of itOne key way to keep your emotions in check is to change your sensory input – motion dictates emotion as the old saying goes. So jolt your physical body out of routine by attending an exercise class or try channelling a busy mind with a puzzle or a book – anything to break your existing routine.

#17) Maintain a schedule (and stick to it!)Ensuring that you create a schedule and stick to it is extremely important if you want to complete tasks effectively.

Paul Minors of Productivityist writes “When you schedule appointments in your calendar, you’re saying to yourself: “I’m going to do A, B and C by X date and it’s going to take Y hours. Once you make this promise, it becomes harder to procrastinate.”

#18) Eat well

This sounds like an easy one but regulating what you eat and drink can have a massive effect on your emotional state, so try your best to maintain a balanced diet.

#19) Don’t get mad

Funnel your emotional energy into something productive. It’s okay to keep overwhelming emotions inside, especially if it’s not an appropriate time to let them out. However, when you do, rather than vent it on something futile, turn it into motivation instead. Don’t get mad, get better.

#20) Be interestedA key factor in managing yourself and your emotions is consciously taken the time to be interested in the subject matter, whether it be business or personal.

#21) Don’t expect people to trust you (if you can’t trust them)

Establishing trust with a person can be difficult, and once it’s lost it’s very hard to regain. Try to be mindful that people are only human and will make mistakes. By offering your trust, you are inviting people to offer their trust in return.

#22) It’s your choiceYou have the ability to choose how you react to a situation – you can either overreact or remain calm. But it’s your choice.

A personal skills aspect of emotional intelligence, self-motivation refers to our inner drive to achieve and improve our commitment to our goals, our readiness to act on opportunities and our overall optimism.

#23) Personal goalsPersonal goals can provide long-term direction and short-term motivation. So grab a pen and paper and have a think about where you want to be and set some targets for yourself. Base them on your strengths and make them relevant to you and ultimately, make them exciting and achievable. This task alone is enough to get you instantly motivated!

#24) Be realisticWhen you’ve set a new goal, be sure to give yourself realistic and clear aims to achieving that goal and understand that change is an inevitable part of life. Achievement boosts confidence and as self-confidence rises so does the ability to achieve more, see how it works?

#25) Positive thinkingTo keep motivated it’s important to maintain a positive and optimistic mindset. See problems and setbacks as learning opportunities instead of failings and try to avoid negative people and opt to surround yourself with positive, well-motivated people – they’ll have a great effect on you.



#26) Lifelong learningBoth knowledge and information are key for feeding your mind and keeping you curious and motivated. And with information so easily accessible, you have the opportunity to fuel your values and passions at the click of a button!

#27) Be prepared to leave your comfort zoneThe biggest barrier to achieving your full potential is not challenging yourself frequently enough. Great things can happen to you if you’re willing to leave your comfort zone, so do so as often as you can.

#28) Help

Don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it, and vice versa. If others need help, don’t hold back in giving it to them. Seeing other people succeed will only help to motivate yourself.

#29) Stand and stretchFor an instant short term boost to your motivation, take a stand and stretch out as far as you can for 10 seconds. When you return to your desk, you’ll be in the correct frame of mind and ready to work.

Quite simply, empathy is the ability to understand other people’s emotions. Understanding that everyone has their own set of feelings, desires, triggers and fears. To be empathetic you’re allowing their experiences to resonate with your own in order to respond in an emotionally appropriate way. It’s a lifelong skill and the most important one for navigating relationships, and whilst it may not come naturally, there are a few ways it can be nurtured.

#30) Listen

Before you’re able to empathise with someone you first need to understand what it is they’re saying, which means listening is at the very epicentre of empathy. It involves letting them talk without interruption, preconceptions, scepticism and putting your own issues on pause to allow yourself to absorb their situation and consider how they are feeling before you react.

#31) Try to be approachableWhether you’re the leader of a team or working on a project with others, try to remain accessible and approachable.

#32) PerspectiveWe’re all familiar with the phrase “put yourself in their shoes”, and this is exactly that. The simplest way of gaining a little perspective the next time an issue or situation arises is to switch places with the other person and really think about what’s happening from their point of view. Sometimes there’s no right or wrong but at least you’ll understand enough to come to a resolve or offer some useful advice.

#33) Open yourself upOne of the quickest ways to offer a sincere exchange or sign of empathy is to listen to someone’s experiences and connect to it with a similar experience of your own. Don’t be afraid to open yourself up, it might just be the start of a great and lasting friendship.



#34) Immerse yourself in a new cultureThe old saying ‘travel broadens the mind’ is still true, even in this ever shrinking world. Sometimes the best way to open your mind is to jump on a plane and go somewhere completely different.

#35) Cultivate a curiosity about strangers

Highly empathetic people have an insatiable curiosity about strangers. When we talk to people outside of our usual social circle we learn about and begin to understand opinions, views and lives that are different to our own. So next time you’re sat on a bus you know just what to do…

#36) Acknowledge what people are sayingAnother useful tip is, whilst listening to what a person has to say, use acknowledgement words such as ‘I understand’ and ‘I see’ to show a person you’re listening (but of course only say these things if you are actually listening!).

In emotional intelligence terms, social skills refer to the skills needed to handle and influence other people’s emotions effectively. It covers a wide range of abilities, from communication and conflict management to dealing with change, meeting new people and building relationships and plays a part in almost every part of our lives, from work life to our romantic life. It’s complex and requires utilising almost every point we have already mentioned, but here are a few pointers for you.

#37) Get startedA good way to get started on improving your social skills is to isolate one skill you know you’d like to develop, this narrows it down and gives you focus. Internationally known psychologist, Daniel Goleman, suggests highlighting someone you know to be good at that particular skill, observing how they act and how they control their emotions and then implementing and applying that knowledge to yourself.

#38) Wear somebody else’s shoesNot literally of course! Everyone has heard the phrase ‘walk a mile in somebody else’s shoes’, but how many people actually practice this advice? Give it a try, you never know.

#39) Practice makes perfectThe idea of practising your social skills might sound strange, but like everything in life, practice makes perfect.

#40) Social media cold turkeyWe don’t mean to sound old, but taking your social life offline and engaging face-to-face with people will open up so many opportunities for you to gain and develop your social skills. So next time instead of instant messaging your best friend, meet up for a drink! Emotional intelligence doesn’t expand within the confines of (un) social media…

#41) Get networkingA good way to practise your social acumen is to attend local networking events. The great thing about these events is that everyone attending has a shared reason for attending.

#42) It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it

We’re talking about the importance of nonverbal communication and how that can affect a person’s opinion of you. Body language, tone of voice and eye contact is key to letting others know how you feel emotionally. So once you’ve got your emotions intact, think about how you’re physically coming across.

#43) The unknownThe ultimate method to building your social skills is to get out there and be sociable. It sounds simple, but you can’t strengthen your social skills without being social! Join a group or network outside of your usual circle; it’s the perfect way to put all of our tips into play.

Those with a high EQ very rarely display the following traits, something for you to be mindful of.

#44) DramaEmotionally intelligent people listen, offer sound advice and extend empathy to those who need it but they don’t permit others’ lives and emotions to effect or rule their own.

#45) ComplainingComplaining implies two things – one, that we are victims, and two, that there are no solutions to our problems. Rarely does an emotionally intelligent person feel victimised, and even more infrequently do they feel that a solution is beyond their grasp. So instead of looking for someone or something to blame, they think constructively and dissolve the solution in private.



#46) NegativityEmotionally intelligent people have the ability to kerb cynical thoughts. They acknowledge that negative thoughts are just that – thoughts – and rely on facts to come to conclusions as well as being able to silence or zone out any negativity.

#47) Dwelling on the pastThose with high emotional intelligence choose to learn from the mistakes and choices they have made and instead of dwelling on the past are mindful to live in the now.

#48) SelfishnessWhilst a degree of selfishness is required to get ahead in life, too much can fracture relationships and cause disharmony. Try to avoid being overly selfish and consider others needs.

#49) Giving in to peer pressureJust because everyone else does something, they don’t feel compelled to follow suit if they don’t want to. They think independently, and never conform just to please other people.

#50) Being overly criticalNothing destroys a person’s morale faster than being overly critical. Remember that people are only human and have the same motivations (and limitations) as you. Take the time to understand another person then communicate the change you want to see.

By understanding and successfully applying emotional intelligence, you too can reach your full potential and achieve your goals.

Harvard Business School Online's Business Insights Blog provides the career insights you need to achieve your goals and gain confidence in your business skills.

Emotional intelligence is a crucial component of leadership. Your ability to manage your emotions, as well as recognize and influence others’, has been considered one of the strongest indicators of workplace performance. Research shows that 90 percent of top performers are high in emotional intelligence.

Technical skills will only get you so far. If you’re an aspiring or current leader, you need to build your emotional intelligence to bring out the best in others and cultivate high-performing teams.

“Leaders prime the emotional state of the organization,” said Travis Bradberry, president of emotional intelligence provider TalentSmart, to the Society for Human Resource Management. “When they’re ineffective, when they set poor examples of how they treat other people, that trickles down throughout the company.”

Emotional intelligence, also known as emotional quotient or EQ, is the ability to understand and manage your emotions and the emotions of others. 

Similar to IQ, emotional intelligence can be measured through various assessments, but IQ represents cognitive abilities while EQ is a measure of one’s emotional capabilities. 

While emotional intelligence is beneficial for everyone, it’s especially important for those in leadership positions. Emotionally intelligent leaders can empathize with others, communicate effectively, and manage conflict. All of these abilities are qualities of effective leaders.

If you want to enhance your leadership capabilities, here are five emotional intelligence skills you need and ways you can develop them.

Access your free e-book today.

Self-awareness is having a clear understanding of your strengths, limitations, emotions, beliefs, and motivations. It sounds simple enough, yet 79 percent of executives surveyed by organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry had at least one blind spot—or a skill they ranked among their strongest that others reported as a weakness.

Leaders who are adept at recognizing and managing their emotions are better equipped to perceive others’ feelings and know how to motivate employees. Those who don’t could see a slip in performance: Research in the  Harvard Business Review found that teams with individuals who lack self-awareness make worse decisions and are less effective at conflict management.

By acknowledging your weaknesses, you can build trust and transparency among your team. You can also own your professional development by knowing the areas in which you need to improve in order to advance your career.

Self-regulation refers to how you manage your emotions, behaviors, and impulses. The more self-aware you are, the easier this becomes; if you can recognize what you’re feeling and why, you can respond appropriately.

“In my experience, I’ve never seen the tendency toward radical outbursts to surface as an indicator of strong leadership,” writes Daniel Goleman, the psychologist who popularized emotional intelligence, on his website.

If prone to emotional outbursts or overreacting, there are tactics you can use to improve your self-regulation, such as:

If you acknowledge your emotions and give yourself time to process them, you can carefully craft how you respond and avoid doing anything that could jeopardize the goodwill you’ve worked hard to build.

Empathy is the capability of understanding another person’s experiences and emotions, and has been ranked as the top leadership skill needed today by global consulting firm DDI. According to DDI's research, leaders who excel at listening and responding with empathy perform more than 40 percent higher in coaching, planning, and decision-making.

According to a separate survey by Businessolver, 96 percent of employees rank empathy as important, but 92 percent say it’s undervalued. It shouldn’t be, though: Companies that prioritize empathy experience an increase in revenue, retention, and productivity.

By actively listening to your employees and taking the time to understand their wants and needs, you can boost engagement, build trust, and more effectively coach them through challenges. The more your team feels appreciated, the more invested they’ll be, which, in turn, leads to higher morale and stronger company culture.

Motivation refers to your ability to inspire both yourself and others to action. Here, it’s essential to lead by example. Self-motivated leaders care more about hitting organizational milestones than monetary awards. They set goals, take initiative, rise to the challenge, and stay optimistic during turbulent times.

The more positive you are, the more confident your team will feel. Your intrinsic motivation will permeate the organization, and you’ll have a better understanding of how to empower employees.

Social skills are all about how you perceive emotions and interact and communicate with others. For example, emotionally intelligent leaders can walk into a room of employees with pursed lips and clenched fists and not only sense the tension, but know how to address and resolve the conflict before it escalates.

The more in tune you are with your emotions, the easier it will be to assess others’. And if you can assess others’ feelings, you can more easily build and maintain relationships. Leaders with strong social skills know they can’t achieve success alone. Surpassing goals and reaching milestones requires collaboration, communication, and a shared vision.

Related: How to Give Feedback Effectively

If you have gaps in your current skill set, there are actions you can take to boost your emotional intelligence. Methods include:

At the end of the workday, reflect on how your meetings, projects, and interactions went—whether positive or negative. By writing your thoughts down, you can spot specific patterns about your behaviors and reactions, as well as others’.

Where did you excel? How are your employees feeling? Are there certain people or situations that frustrated you and, if so, why? The more introspective you are, the better. For example, you’ll become more aware of what upsets you, so that you can avoid a future outburst, or mimic actions that have proven to boost employee morale.

In a 360-degree assessment, you solicit feedback from your manager, colleagues, and peers, while also undergoing an individual self-assessment. Through the process, you can gain valuable insights into what your co-workers perceive as your strengths and weaknesses, as well as uncover any blind spots you might have.

According to Jack Zenger, CEO of leadership development firm Zenger Folkman, more than 85 percent of all Fortune 500 companies use 360-degree feedback. It can help improve leaders’ self-awareness, which, in turn, can result in improved workplace effectiveness, less stress, and stronger relationships.

According to Psychology Today, only about 10 percent of people listen effectively. It’s easy to get distracted by technology, background noise, and your own thoughts. Yet, to be an effective communicator and emotionally intelligent leader, you need to be a good listener. 

To become more emotionally intelligent, practice active listening. Try to focus on what the speaker is saying and show that you’re engaged by paraphrasing and using other non-verbal cues like nodding. By actively listening at work, it will be easier to connect with others and truly understand their thoughts and feelings.

To understand the emotions of others, you need to understand your own first.

When you catch yourself feeling a particularly strong emotion, whether it’s a positive or negative one, make a conscious effort to think about what you’re feeling. Take a second and consider why you’re feeling this way and what might have triggered such a strong emotional response.

This will help you become more aware of your own emotions and better understand your colleagues’. As an empathetic leader, you’ll be able to cultivate a high-performing team.





If you’re interested in diving deeper into emotional intelligence and enhancing your leadership capabilities, taking an online leadership course or training could be the best next step.

Online courses offer working professionals the flexibility to complete coursework on their schedule and connect with a global community of like-minded peers, all while gaining new skills and knowledge.

One program to consider is Harvard Business School Online’s Leadership Principles course, which provides a 360-degree assessment to help you better understand who you are as a leader and how others perceive you.



Building your emotional intelligence skills can not only help you grow as a leader but enable you to motivate and coach teams more effectively. In turn, you can make a greater impact on your organization by boosting morale, productivity, and communication—enabling you to advance your business and career simultaneously.

          An overview of the importance of Emotional Intelligence for your own success and the success of your organization.
        

Blog

Today’s in-demand skills are increasingly technical in nature. However, there’s a corresponding need for the uniquely human ability to work with and through others to accomplish important goals.

Enter emotional intelligence (EI), a set of skills that help us recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions as well as recognize, understand and influence the emotions of others.

We recently spoke with Margaret Andrews, instructor of Emotional Intelligence in Leadership, about how people can build EI for better interpersonal relations. Andrews is the former associate dean at Harvard University’s Division of Continuing Education and executive director at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

“Emotional intelligence is critical in building and maintaining relationships and influencing others — key skills that help people throughout their career and wherever they sit in an organizational structure,” says Andrews.

Additionally, research suggests that people with a high emotional quotient (EQ) are more innovative and have higher job satisfaction than those with lower EQs.

Let’s dive into what exactly EI entails, and how you can improve on this essential component of successful relationships.

Emotional intelligence is a set of skills and behaviors. While some people will be naturally more adept at certain aspects, EI can be learned, developed, and enhanced.

The four main components of EI are self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness, and social skills:

Self-awareness is the ability to identify and understand your own emotions and the impact we have on others. It’s the cornerstone of emotional intelligence and the other components of EI depend on this self-awareness.

“It all starts with self-awareness, which is foundation of EI, and it builds from there. If you’re aware of your own emotions and the behaviors they trigger, you can begin to manage these emotions and behaviors,” says Andrews.

Our emotions impact our mood, behaviors, performance, and interactions with other people. “We are all having emotions all the time,” says Andrews, “the question is whether you are aware of these emotions and the impact they have on your behavior — and other people.”

According to Tasha Eurich, an organizational psychologist, researcher, and author of Insight, people who are self-aware tend to be more confident and more creative. They also make better decisions, build stronger relationships, and communicate more effectively.

Self-awareness opens the door to self-regulation, which is the ability to manage these emotions and behaviors. Once we’re aware of our emotions, we can begin to manage them and keep the disruptive emotions and impulses under control.

“People with strong self-regulation can pause and take a deep breath in tense and stressful situations, explains Andrews, “which helps them remain calm and think before they speak or act.”

These people tend toward a positive outlook and are adaptable to a variety of situations and circumstances. “On the flip side,” she says, “those that cannot contain their negative emotions and impulses often set off a chain reaction of negative emotions in others.”

“There’s an old adage that people join organizations and leave managers,” says Andrews, “and it’s true. So, companies — or managers — that have high turnover rates should take a look in the mirror.”

Social awareness is our ability to understand the emotions of others and a key component of this is empathy.

Jamil Zaki, a Stanford professor and author of The War for Kindness, describes empathy as having three components — identifying what others feel, sharing this emotion, and wishing to improve their experience.

“It’s not about how you would feel in their situation, but rather, how they actually feel,” says Andrews.

People with strong social awareness tend toward kindness. However, this doesn’t mean they cannot give others difficult feedback — in fact, they may be better at delivering this ‘tough love’ because they understand the other person and want to help them improve.

“Social skills are what separate a great manager from a good one,” says Andrews.

These skills, which include influence, conflict management, teamwork, and the ability to inspire others, make it possible to build and maintain healthy relationships in all parts of your life.

People with strong social skills can make an enormous difference on a team and in organizations because they understand others and act on this knowledge to move people toward a common goal.

To improve your emotional intelligence, you need to start at the beginning, with self-awareness. However, gauging your self-awareness is innately difficult because, as Andrews puts it, “you don’t know what you don’t know.”

Without an objective sense of who you are and what drives you, it’s nearly impossible to be emotionally intelligent. Andrews cites a study by Tasha Eurich which found that 95 percent of participants gave themselves high marks in self-awareness.

However, using more empirical measures of self-awareness, the study found that only 10-15 percent of the cohort was truly self-aware.

That’s a pretty big gap, and one that suggests most of us aren’t very self-aware. What’s worse, research also shows that managers and CEOs may be the least self-aware of all. This is not despite their authority, but quite possibly because of it.

Eurich wrote in the Harvard Business Review that the more power someone obtains, the more likely they are to be overconfident about how well they know themselves. After all, those at the top of the chain have fewer people giving them feedback.

Often, when managers do receive feedback from employees, it isn’t as honest as it might be because subordinates are afraid of incurring negative consequences. Managers are insulated from criticism, and as a result, self-awareness sinks.

Receiving honest, constructive feedback is key to becoming self-aware. Andrews notes that a 360-degree emotional intelligence assessment can be a very effective way to gain insight into your EI-components and the impact you have on others.

“Many people shrug off differences in how they rate themselves versus how others rate them on EI competencies by saying that they’re too hard on themselves or that others don’t really understand their intent,” says Andrews, “but really it shows a lack of self-awareness.”

Emotional intelligence is a set of skills and behaviors that can be learned and developed. Here are some telltale signs of people with low EQ and those with high EQ.

People with low EQ:

People with high EQ:

Developing emotional intelligence is an ongoing process. The journey differs from person to person. Nonetheless, according to Andrews, the following actions may lead you to better self-awareness, empathy, and social skills.

What emotions are you feeling right now? Can you name them? When in a stressful situation, what emotions typically arise? How would you like to respond in these situations? Can you stop to pause and reconsider your response? Taking a moment to name your feelings and temper your reactivity is an integral step toward EI.

Audit your self-perception by asking managers, colleagues, friends, or family how they would rate your emotional intelligence. For example, ask them about how you respond to difficult situations, how adaptable or empathetic you are, and/or how well you handle conflict. It may not always be what you want to hear, but it will often be what you need to hear.

Studies show that reading literature with complex characters can improve empathy. Reading stories from other people’s perspectives helps us gain insight into their thoughts, motivations, and actions and may help enhance your social awareness.

Building E.I. in yourself is one thing, but influencing others to adopt a more empathetic mindset can be a challenge. To create a culture of high EQ, managers and supervisors must model emotionally intelligent behavior.

“If you want to change how your organization does in EI, you can set norms for how people communicate and how they disagree,” says Andrews.

In addition, you need to recognize and celebrate those that exhibit emotional intelligence.;

“Start making heroes of people who help other people,” says Andrews. “It’s not just the person who got to the top of the mountain first — it’s all the people who helped them. If you want to encourage good team behavior, recognize it, and call it out for what it is.”

        Emotional Intelligence


Emotional intelligence fuels your performance both in the workplace and in your personal life, but it starts with you. From your confidence, empathy and optimism to your social skills and self-control, understanding and managing your own emotions can accelerate success in all areas of your life.

No matter what professional field you are in, whether you manage a team of two or 20, or even just yourself, realising how effective you are at controlling your own emotional energy is a great starting point. Absent from the curriculum, emotional intelligence isn’t something we are taught or tested on, so where did it come from, what is it, do you have it and is it really that important?

Fortunately, it is something you can learn and we’ve compiled a comprehensive list of tips to help you explore your own level of emotional intelligence and gain important emotional intelligence skills that can be implemented into everyday life. Some of these tips we follow ourselves and others have been revealed to us by our amazing clients and partners who know how to motivate and inspire their teams but first and foremost, themselves.

1. Emotional Intelligence2. Self-awareness3. Self-management4. Motivation5. Empathy6. Social skills7. What to avoid

 

Put simply, Emotional Intelligence is how well individuals identify and manage their own emotions and react to the emotions of others. It’s understanding how those emotions shape your thoughts and actions so you can have greater control over your behaviour and develop the skills to manage yourself more effectively. Becoming more emotionally conscious allows us to grow and gain a deeper understanding of who we are, enabling us to communicate better with others and build stronger relationships.

We suggest starting with these initial 8 tips, they provide a good starting point to discovering the foundations of your emotional intelligence.

#1) Practice observing how you feelOften we lead hectic, busy lifestyles and it’s all too easy for us to lose touch with our emotions. To reconnect, try setting a timer for various points during the day. When the timer goes off, take a few deep breaths and notice how you’re feeling emotionally. Pay attention to where that emotion is showing up as a physical feeling in your body and what the sensation feels like. The more you practice, the more it will become second nature.

#2) Pay attention to how you behaveWhile you’re practising your emotional awareness, take the time to notice your behaviour too. Observe how you act when you’re experiencing certain emotions, and how that affects your day-to-day life. Managing our emotions becomes easier once we become more conscious of how we react to them.

#3) Question your own opinionsIn this hyper-connected world, it is easy to fall into an ‘opinion bubble’. This is a state of existence where your own opinions are constantly re-enforced by people with similar viewpoints. Take time to read the other side of the story and have your views challenged (even if you still feel they are right). This will help you understand other people and be more receptive to new ideas.

#4) Take responsibility for your feelingsYour emotions and behaviour come from you, they don’t come from anyone else and once you start accepting responsibility for how you feel and how you behave it will have a positive impact on all areas of your life.



#5) Take time to celebrate the positiveA key part emotional intelligence is celebrating and reflecting on the positive moments in life. People who experience positive emotions are generally more resilient and more likely to have fulfilling relationships, which will help them move past adversity.

#6) But don’t ignore the negative

Reflecting on negative feelings is just as important as reflecting on the positive. Understanding why you feel negative is key to becoming a fully-rounded individual, who is more able to deal with negative issues in the future.

#7) Don’t forget to breathe

Life throws various situations our way, with most of us experiencing some sort of stress on a regular basis. To manage your emotions when this happens and to avoid outbursts, don’t forget to breathe. Call a time out and go put some cold water on your face, go outside and get some fresh air or make a drink – anything to keep your cool and give yourself a chance to get a hold on what’s happening and how you should respond.

#8) A lifetime processUnderstand and remember that emotional intelligence is something you develop and requires continual improvement; it’s very much a lifetime practice.

A key component of emotional intelligence, self-awareness is the ability to recognise and understand your own character, moods and emotions and their effect on others. It includes a realistic self-assessment of what you’re capable of – your strengths and weaknesses – and knowing how others perceive you. It can help highlight areas for self-improvement, make you better at adapting and can limit wrongful decisions.

#9) Learn to look at yourself objectivelyKnowing yourself completely is difficult and it’s almost impossible to look at yourself objectively, so input from those who know you is vital. Ask them where your strengths and weaknesses lie, write down what they say and compare it. Look out for any patterns and remember not to argue with them – it doesn’t mean they’re right – they’re just trying to help you gauge your perception from another’s point of view.

#10) Keep a diaryA great way to get an accurate gauge of yourself is to keep a diary. Start by writing down what happened to you at the end of every day, how it made you feel and how you dealt with it. Documenting details like these will make you more aware of what you’re doing and will highlight where problems might be coming from. Periodically, look back over your comments and take note of any trends.

#11) Understand what motivates youEveryone has a core motivation when they begin a project. The difficulty is keeping this driving force in mind when adversity appears. All too often people start a project but fail to complete it because they lose their motivation to do so. Take time to understand what motivates you and use it to push you across the finish line.

#12) Take it easy

Sometimes emotional outbreaks occur because we don’t take the time out to slow down and process how we’re feeling. Give yourself a break and make a conscious effort to meditate, do yoga or read – a little escapism works wonders. And then the next time you have an emotional reaction to something, try to pause before you react.

#13) Acknowledge your emotional triggers

Self-aware individuals are able to recognise their emotions as they occur. It’s important to be flexible with your emotions and adapt them to your situation. Don’t deny your emotions stage time but don’t be rigid with them either, take the time to process your emotions before communicating them.

#14) Predict how you will feelThink about a situation you’re going into and predict how you will feel. Practice naming and accepting the feelings – naming the feeling puts you in control. Try to choose an appropriate reaction to the feeling rather than just reacting to it.



#15) Trust your intuitionIf you are still unsure about which path to take, trust your intuition. After all, your subconscious has been learning which path to take throughout your entire life.

Once you’ve gotten to grips with self-awareness and how your emotions work, you can get a handle on self-management. Which means taking responsibility for your own behaviour and well-being as well as controlling emotional outbursts.

#16) Snap out of itOne key way to keep your emotions in check is to change your sensory input – motion dictates emotion as the old saying goes. So jolt your physical body out of routine by attending an exercise class or try channelling a busy mind with a puzzle or a book – anything to break your existing routine.

#17) Maintain a schedule (and stick to it!)Ensuring that you create a schedule and stick to it is extremely important if you want to complete tasks effectively.

Paul Minors of Productivityist writes “When you schedule appointments in your calendar, you’re saying to yourself: “I’m going to do A, B and C by X date and it’s going to take Y hours. Once you make this promise, it becomes harder to procrastinate.”

#18) Eat well

This sounds like an easy one but regulating what you eat and drink can have a massive effect on your emotional state, so try your best to maintain a balanced diet.

#19) Don’t get mad

Funnel your emotional energy into something productive. It’s okay to keep overwhelming emotions inside, especially if it’s not an appropriate time to let them out. However, when you do, rather than vent it on something futile, turn it into motivation instead. Don’t get mad, get better.

#20) Be interestedA key factor in managing yourself and your emotions is consciously taken the time to be interested in the subject matter, whether it be business or personal.

#21) Don’t expect people to trust you (if you can’t trust them)

Establishing trust with a person can be difficult, and once it’s lost it’s very hard to regain. Try to be mindful that people are only human and will make mistakes. By offering your trust, you are inviting people to offer their trust in return.

#22) It’s your choiceYou have the ability to choose how you react to a situation – you can either overreact or remain calm. But it’s your choice.

A personal skills aspect of emotional intelligence, self-motivation refers to our inner drive to achieve and improve our commitment to our goals, our readiness to act on opportunities and our overall optimism.

#23) Personal goalsPersonal goals can provide long-term direction and short-term motivation. So grab a pen and paper and have a think about where you want to be and set some targets for yourself. Base them on your strengths and make them relevant to you and ultimately, make them exciting and achievable. This task alone is enough to get you instantly motivated!

#24) Be realisticWhen you’ve set a new goal, be sure to give yourself realistic and clear aims to achieving that goal and understand that change is an inevitable part of life. Achievement boosts confidence and as self-confidence rises so does the ability to achieve more, see how it works?

#25) Positive thinkingTo keep motivated it’s important to maintain a positive and optimistic mindset. See problems and setbacks as learning opportunities instead of failings and try to avoid negative people and opt to surround yourself with positive, well-motivated people – they’ll have a great effect on you.



#26) Lifelong learningBoth knowledge and information are key for feeding your mind and keeping you curious and motivated. And with information so easily accessible, you have the opportunity to fuel your values and passions at the click of a button!

#27) Be prepared to leave your comfort zoneThe biggest barrier to achieving your full potential is not challenging yourself frequently enough. Great things can happen to you if you’re willing to leave your comfort zone, so do so as often as you can.

#28) Help

Don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it, and vice versa. If others need help, don’t hold back in giving it to them. Seeing other people succeed will only help to motivate yourself.

#29) Stand and stretchFor an instant short term boost to your motivation, take a stand and stretch out as far as you can for 10 seconds. When you return to your desk, you’ll be in the correct frame of mind and ready to work.

Quite simply, empathy is the ability to understand other people’s emotions. Understanding that everyone has their own set of feelings, desires, triggers and fears. To be empathetic you’re allowing their experiences to resonate with your own in order to respond in an emotionally appropriate way. It’s a lifelong skill and the most important one for navigating relationships, and whilst it may not come naturally, there are a few ways it can be nurtured.

#30) Listen

Before you’re able to empathise with someone you first need to understand what it is they’re saying, which means listening is at the very epicentre of empathy. It involves letting them talk without interruption, preconceptions, scepticism and putting your own issues on pause to allow yourself to absorb their situation and consider how they are feeling before you react.

#31) Try to be approachableWhether you’re the leader of a team or working on a project with others, try to remain accessible and approachable.

#32) PerspectiveWe’re all familiar with the phrase “put yourself in their shoes”, and this is exactly that. The simplest way of gaining a little perspective the next time an issue or situation arises is to switch places with the other person and really think about what’s happening from their point of view. Sometimes there’s no right or wrong but at least you’ll understand enough to come to a resolve or offer some useful advice.

#33) Open yourself upOne of the quickest ways to offer a sincere exchange or sign of empathy is to listen to someone’s experiences and connect to it with a similar experience of your own. Don’t be afraid to open yourself up, it might just be the start of a great and lasting friendship.



#34) Immerse yourself in a new cultureThe old saying ‘travel broadens the mind’ is still true, even in this ever shrinking world. Sometimes the best way to open your mind is to jump on a plane and go somewhere completely different.

#35) Cultivate a curiosity about strangers

Highly empathetic people have an insatiable curiosity about strangers. When we talk to people outside of our usual social circle we learn about and begin to understand opinions, views and lives that are different to our own. So next time you’re sat on a bus you know just what to do…

#36) Acknowledge what people are sayingAnother useful tip is, whilst listening to what a person has to say, use acknowledgement words such as ‘I understand’ and ‘I see’ to show a person you’re listening (but of course only say these things if you are actually listening!).

In emotional intelligence terms, social skills refer to the skills needed to handle and influence other people’s emotions effectively. It covers a wide range of abilities, from communication and conflict management to dealing with change, meeting new people and building relationships and plays a part in almost every part of our lives, from work life to our romantic life. It’s complex and requires utilising almost every point we have already mentioned, but here are a few pointers for you.

#37) Get startedA good way to get started on improving your social skills is to isolate one skill you know you’d like to develop, this narrows it down and gives you focus. Internationally known psychologist, Daniel Goleman, suggests highlighting someone you know to be good at that particular skill, observing how they act and how they control their emotions and then implementing and applying that knowledge to yourself.

#38) Wear somebody else’s shoesNot literally of course! Everyone has heard the phrase ‘walk a mile in somebody else’s shoes’, but how many people actually practice this advice? Give it a try, you never know.

#39) Practice makes perfectThe idea of practising your social skills might sound strange, but like everything in life, practice makes perfect.

#40) Social media cold turkeyWe don’t mean to sound old, but taking your social life offline and engaging face-to-face with people will open up so many opportunities for you to gain and develop your social skills. So next time instead of instant messaging your best friend, meet up for a drink! Emotional intelligence doesn’t expand within the confines of (un) social media…

#41) Get networkingA good way to practise your social acumen is to attend local networking events. The great thing about these events is that everyone attending has a shared reason for attending.

#42) It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it

We’re talking about the importance of nonverbal communication and how that can affect a person’s opinion of you. Body language, tone of voice and eye contact is key to letting others know how you feel emotionally. So once you’ve got your emotions intact, think about how you’re physically coming across.

#43) The unknownThe ultimate method to building your social skills is to get out there and be sociable. It sounds simple, but you can’t strengthen your social skills without being social! Join a group or network outside of your usual circle; it’s the perfect way to put all of our tips into play.

Those with a high EQ very rarely display the following traits, something for you to be mindful of.

#44) DramaEmotionally intelligent people listen, offer sound advice and extend empathy to those who need it but they don’t permit others’ lives and emotions to effect or rule their own.

#45) ComplainingComplaining implies two things – one, that we are victims, and two, that there are no solutions to our problems. Rarely does an emotionally intelligent person feel victimised, and even more infrequently do they feel that a solution is beyond their grasp. So instead of looking for someone or something to blame, they think constructively and dissolve the solution in private.



#46) NegativityEmotionally intelligent people have the ability to kerb cynical thoughts. They acknowledge that negative thoughts are just that – thoughts – and rely on facts to come to conclusions as well as being able to silence or zone out any negativity.

#47) Dwelling on the pastThose with high emotional intelligence choose to learn from the mistakes and choices they have made and instead of dwelling on the past are mindful to live in the now.

#48) SelfishnessWhilst a degree of selfishness is required to get ahead in life, too much can fracture relationships and cause disharmony. Try to avoid being overly selfish and consider others needs.

#49) Giving in to peer pressureJust because everyone else does something, they don’t feel compelled to follow suit if they don’t want to. They think independently, and never conform just to please other people.

#50) Being overly criticalNothing destroys a person’s morale faster than being overly critical. Remember that people are only human and have the same motivations (and limitations) as you. Take the time to understand another person then communicate the change you want to see.

By understanding and successfully applying emotional intelligence, you too can reach your full potential and achieve your goals.

Harvard Business School Online's Business Insights Blog provides the career insights you need to achieve your goals and gain confidence in your business skills.

Emotional intelligence is a crucial component of leadership. Your ability to manage your emotions, as well as recognize and influence others’, has been considered one of the strongest indicators of workplace performance. Research shows that 90 percent of top performers are high in emotional intelligence.

Technical skills will only get you so far. If you’re an aspiring or current leader, you need to build your emotional intelligence to bring out the best in others and cultivate high-performing teams.

“Leaders prime the emotional state of the organization,” said Travis Bradberry, president of emotional intelligence provider TalentSmart, to the Society for Human Resource Management. “When they’re ineffective, when they set poor examples of how they treat other people, that trickles down throughout the company.”

Emotional intelligence, also known as emotional quotient or EQ, is the ability to understand and manage your emotions and the emotions of others. 

Similar to IQ, emotional intelligence can be measured through various assessments, but IQ represents cognitive abilities while EQ is a measure of one’s emotional capabilities. 

While emotional intelligence is beneficial for everyone, it’s especially important for those in leadership positions. Emotionally intelligent leaders can empathize with others, communicate effectively, and manage conflict. All of these abilities are qualities of effective leaders.

If you want to enhance your leadership capabilities, here are five emotional intelligence skills you need and ways you can develop them.

Access your free e-book today.

Self-awareness is having a clear understanding of your strengths, limitations, emotions, beliefs, and motivations. It sounds simple enough, yet 79 percent of executives surveyed by organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry had at least one blind spot—or a skill they ranked among their strongest that others reported as a weakness.

Leaders who are adept at recognizing and managing their emotions are better equipped to perceive others’ feelings and know how to motivate employees. Those who don’t could see a slip in performance: Research in the  Harvard Business Review found that teams with individuals who lack self-awareness make worse decisions and are less effective at conflict management.

By acknowledging your weaknesses, you can build trust and transparency among your team. You can also own your professional development by knowing the areas in which you need to improve in order to advance your career.

Self-regulation refers to how you manage your emotions, behaviors, and impulses. The more self-aware you are, the easier this becomes; if you can recognize what you’re feeling and why, you can respond appropriately.

“In my experience, I’ve never seen the tendency toward radical outbursts to surface as an indicator of strong leadership,” writes Daniel Goleman, the psychologist who popularized emotional intelligence, on his website.

If prone to emotional outbursts or overreacting, there are tactics you can use to improve your self-regulation, such as:

If you acknowledge your emotions and give yourself time to process them, you can carefully craft how you respond and avoid doing anything that could jeopardize the goodwill you’ve worked hard to build.

Empathy is the capability of understanding another person’s experiences and emotions, and has been ranked as the top leadership skill needed today by global consulting firm DDI. According to DDI's research, leaders who excel at listening and responding with empathy perform more than 40 percent higher in coaching, planning, and decision-making.

According to a separate survey by Businessolver, 96 percent of employees rank empathy as important, but 92 percent say it’s undervalued. It shouldn’t be, though: Companies that prioritize empathy experience an increase in revenue, retention, and productivity.

By actively listening to your employees and taking the time to understand their wants and needs, you can boost engagement, build trust, and more effectively coach them through challenges. The more your team feels appreciated, the more invested they’ll be, which, in turn, leads to higher morale and stronger company culture.

Motivation refers to your ability to inspire both yourself and others to action. Here, it’s essential to lead by example. Self-motivated leaders care more about hitting organizational milestones than monetary awards. They set goals, take initiative, rise to the challenge, and stay optimistic during turbulent times.

The more positive you are, the more confident your team will feel. Your intrinsic motivation will permeate the organization, and you’ll have a better understanding of how to empower employees.

Social skills are all about how you perceive emotions and interact and communicate with others. For example, emotionally intelligent leaders can walk into a room of employees with pursed lips and clenched fists and not only sense the tension, but know how to address and resolve the conflict before it escalates.

The more in tune you are with your emotions, the easier it will be to assess others’. And if you can assess others’ feelings, you can more easily build and maintain relationships. Leaders with strong social skills know they can’t achieve success alone. Surpassing goals and reaching milestones requires collaboration, communication, and a shared vision.

Related: How to Give Feedback Effectively

If you have gaps in your current skill set, there are actions you can take to boost your emotional intelligence. Methods include:

At the end of the workday, reflect on how your meetings, projects, and interactions went—whether positive or negative. By writing your thoughts down, you can spot specific patterns about your behaviors and reactions, as well as others’.

Where did you excel? How are your employees feeling? Are there certain people or situations that frustrated you and, if so, why? The more introspective you are, the better. For example, you’ll become more aware of what upsets you, so that you can avoid a future outburst, or mimic actions that have proven to boost employee morale.

In a 360-degree assessment, you solicit feedback from your manager, colleagues, and peers, while also undergoing an individual self-assessment. Through the process, you can gain valuable insights into what your co-workers perceive as your strengths and weaknesses, as well as uncover any blind spots you might have.

According to Jack Zenger, CEO of leadership development firm Zenger Folkman, more than 85 percent of all Fortune 500 companies use 360-degree feedback. It can help improve leaders’ self-awareness, which, in turn, can result in improved workplace effectiveness, less stress, and stronger relationships.

According to Psychology Today, only about 10 percent of people listen effectively. It’s easy to get distracted by technology, background noise, and your own thoughts. Yet, to be an effective communicator and emotionally intelligent leader, you need to be a good listener. 

To become more emotionally intelligent, practice active listening. Try to focus on what the speaker is saying and show that you’re engaged by paraphrasing and using other non-verbal cues like nodding. By actively listening at work, it will be easier to connect with others and truly understand their thoughts and feelings.

To understand the emotions of others, you need to understand your own first.

When you catch yourself feeling a particularly strong emotion, whether it’s a positive or negative one, make a conscious effort to think about what you’re feeling. Take a second and consider why you’re feeling this way and what might have triggered such a strong emotional response.

This will help you become more aware of your own emotions and better understand your colleagues’. As an empathetic leader, you’ll be able to cultivate a high-performing team.





If you’re interested in diving deeper into emotional intelligence and enhancing your leadership capabilities, taking an online leadership course or training could be the best next step.

Online courses offer working professionals the flexibility to complete coursework on their schedule and connect with a global community of like-minded peers, all while gaining new skills and knowledge.

One program to consider is Harvard Business School Online’s Leadership Principles course, which provides a 360-degree assessment to help you better understand who you are as a leader and how others perceive you.



Building your emotional intelligence skills can not only help you grow as a leader but enable you to motivate and coach teams more effectively. In turn, you can make a greater impact on your organization by boosting morale, productivity, and communication—enabling you to advance your business and career simultaneously.

          An overview of the importance of Emotional Intelligence for your own success and the success of your organization.
        

Blog

Today’s in-demand skills are increasingly technical in nature. However, there’s a corresponding need for the uniquely human ability to work with and through others to accomplish important goals.

Enter emotional intelligence (EI), a set of skills that help us recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions as well as recognize, understand and influence the emotions of others.

We recently spoke with Margaret Andrews, instructor of Emotional Intelligence in Leadership, about how people can build EI for better interpersonal relations. Andrews is the former associate dean at Harvard University’s Division of Continuing Education and executive director at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

“Emotional intelligence is critical in building and maintaining relationships and influencing others — key skills that help people throughout their career and wherever they sit in an organizational structure,” says Andrews.

Additionally, research suggests that people with a high emotional quotient (EQ) are more innovative and have higher job satisfaction than those with lower EQs.

Let’s dive into what exactly EI entails, and how you can improve on this essential component of successful relationships.

Emotional intelligence is a set of skills and behaviors. While some people will be naturally more adept at certain aspects, EI can be learned, developed, and enhanced.

The four main components of EI are self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness, and social skills:

Self-awareness is the ability to identify and understand your own emotions and the impact we have on others. It’s the cornerstone of emotional intelligence and the other components of EI depend on this self-awareness.

“It all starts with self-awareness, which is foundation of EI, and it builds from there. If you’re aware of your own emotions and the behaviors they trigger, you can begin to manage these emotions and behaviors,” says Andrews.

Our emotions impact our mood, behaviors, performance, and interactions with other people. “We are all having emotions all the time,” says Andrews, “the question is whether you are aware of these emotions and the impact they have on your behavior — and other people.”

According to Tasha Eurich, an organizational psychologist, researcher, and author of Insight, people who are self-aware tend to be more confident and more creative. They also make better decisions, build stronger relationships, and communicate more effectively.

Self-awareness opens the door to self-regulation, which is the ability to manage these emotions and behaviors. Once we’re aware of our emotions, we can begin to manage them and keep the disruptive emotions and impulses under control.

“People with strong self-regulation can pause and take a deep breath in tense and stressful situations, explains Andrews, “which helps them remain calm and think before they speak or act.”

These people tend toward a positive outlook and are adaptable to a variety of situations and circumstances. “On the flip side,” she says, “those that cannot contain their negative emotions and impulses often set off a chain reaction of negative emotions in others.”

“There’s an old adage that people join organizations and leave managers,” says Andrews, “and it’s true. So, companies — or managers — that have high turnover rates should take a look in the mirror.”

Social awareness is our ability to understand the emotions of others and a key component of this is empathy.

Jamil Zaki, a Stanford professor and author of The War for Kindness, describes empathy as having three components — identifying what others feel, sharing this emotion, and wishing to improve their experience.

“It’s not about how you would feel in their situation, but rather, how they actually feel,” says Andrews.

People with strong social awareness tend toward kindness. However, this doesn’t mean they cannot give others difficult feedback — in fact, they may be better at delivering this ‘tough love’ because they understand the other person and want to help them improve.

“Social skills are what separate a great manager from a good one,” says Andrews.

These skills, which include influence, conflict management, teamwork, and the ability to inspire others, make it possible to build and maintain healthy relationships in all parts of your life.

People with strong social skills can make an enormous difference on a team and in organizations because they understand others and act on this knowledge to move people toward a common goal.

To improve your emotional intelligence, you need to start at the beginning, with self-awareness. However, gauging your self-awareness is innately difficult because, as Andrews puts it, “you don’t know what you don’t know.”

Without an objective sense of who you are and what drives you, it’s nearly impossible to be emotionally intelligent. Andrews cites a study by Tasha Eurich which found that 95 percent of participants gave themselves high marks in self-awareness.

However, using more empirical measures of self-awareness, the study found that only 10-15 percent of the cohort was truly self-aware.

That’s a pretty big gap, and one that suggests most of us aren’t very self-aware. What’s worse, research also shows that managers and CEOs may be the least self-aware of all. This is not despite their authority, but quite possibly because of it.

Eurich wrote in the Harvard Business Review that the more power someone obtains, the more likely they are to be overconfident about how well they know themselves. After all, those at the top of the chain have fewer people giving them feedback.

Often, when managers do receive feedback from employees, it isn’t as honest as it might be because subordinates are afraid of incurring negative consequences. Managers are insulated from criticism, and as a result, self-awareness sinks.

Receiving honest, constructive feedback is key to becoming self-aware. Andrews notes that a 360-degree emotional intelligence assessment can be a very effective way to gain insight into your EI-components and the impact you have on others.

“Many people shrug off differences in how they rate themselves versus how others rate them on EI competencies by saying that they’re too hard on themselves or that others don’t really understand their intent,” says Andrews, “but really it shows a lack of self-awareness.”

Emotional intelligence is a set of skills and behaviors that can be learned and developed. Here are some telltale signs of people with low EQ and those with high EQ.

People with low EQ:

People with high EQ:

Developing emotional intelligence is an ongoing process. The journey differs from person to person. Nonetheless, according to Andrews, the following actions may lead you to better self-awareness, empathy, and social skills.

What emotions are you feeling right now? Can you name them? When in a stressful situation, what emotions typically arise? How would you like to respond in these situations? Can you stop to pause and reconsider your response? Taking a moment to name your feelings and temper your reactivity is an integral step toward EI.

Audit your self-perception by asking managers, colleagues, friends, or family how they would rate your emotional intelligence. For example, ask them about how you respond to difficult situations, how adaptable or empathetic you are, and/or how well you handle conflict. It may not always be what you want to hear, but it will often be what you need to hear.

Studies show that reading literature with complex characters can improve empathy. Reading stories from other people’s perspectives helps us gain insight into their thoughts, motivations, and actions and may help enhance your social awareness.

Building E.I. in yourself is one thing, but influencing others to adopt a more empathetic mindset can be a challenge. To create a culture of high EQ, managers and supervisors must model emotionally intelligent behavior.

“If you want to change how your organization does in EI, you can set norms for how people communicate and how they disagree,” says Andrews.

In addition, you need to recognize and celebrate those that exhibit emotional intelligence.;

“Start making heroes of people who help other people,” says Andrews. “It’s not just the person who got to the top of the mountain first — it’s all the people who helped them. If you want to encourage good team behavior, recognize it, and call it out for what it is.”

        Emotional Intelligence


Emotional intelligence fuels your performance both in the workplace and in your personal life, but it starts with you. From your confidence, empathy and optimism to your social skills and self-control, understanding and managing your own emotions can accelerate success in all areas of your life.

No matter what professional field you are in, whether you manage a team of two or 20, or even just yourself, realising how effective you are at controlling your own emotional energy is a great starting point. Absent from the curriculum, emotional intelligence isn’t something we are taught or tested on, so where did it come from, what is it, do you have it and is it really that important?

Fortunately, it is something you can learn and we’ve compiled a comprehensive list of tips to help you explore your own level of emotional intelligence and gain important emotional intelligence skills that can be implemented into everyday life. Some of these tips we follow ourselves and others have been revealed to us by our amazing clients and partners who know how to motivate and inspire their teams but first and foremost, themselves.

1. Emotional Intelligence2. Self-awareness3. Self-management4. Motivation5. Empathy6. Social skills7. What to avoid

 

Put simply, Emotional Intelligence is how well individuals identify and manage their own emotions and react to the emotions of others. It’s understanding how those emotions shape your thoughts and actions so you can have greater control over your behaviour and develop the skills to manage yourself more effectively. Becoming more emotionally conscious allows us to grow and gain a deeper understanding of who we are, enabling us to communicate better with others and build stronger relationships.

We suggest starting with these initial 8 tips, they provide a good starting point to discovering the foundations of your emotional intelligence.

#1) Practice observing how you feelOften we lead hectic, busy lifestyles and it’s all too easy for us to lose touch with our emotions. To reconnect, try setting a timer for various points during the day. When the timer goes off, take a few deep breaths and notice how you’re feeling emotionally. Pay attention to where that emotion is showing up as a physical feeling in your body and what the sensation feels like. The more you practice, the more it will become second nature.

#2) Pay attention to how you behaveWhile you’re practising your emotional awareness, take the time to notice your behaviour too. Observe how you act when you’re experiencing certain emotions, and how that affects your day-to-day life. Managing our emotions becomes easier once we become more conscious of how we react to them.

#3) Question your own opinionsIn this hyper-connected world, it is easy to fall into an ‘opinion bubble’. This is a state of existence where your own opinions are constantly re-enforced by people with similar viewpoints. Take time to read the other side of the story and have your views challenged (even if you still feel they are right). This will help you understand other people and be more receptive to new ideas.

#4) Take responsibility for your feelingsYour emotions and behaviour come from you, they don’t come from anyone else and once you start accepting responsibility for how you feel and how you behave it will have a positive impact on all areas of your life.



#5) Take time to celebrate the positiveA key part emotional intelligence is celebrating and reflecting on the positive moments in life. People who experience positive emotions are generally more resilient and more likely to have fulfilling relationships, which will help them move past adversity.

#6) But don’t ignore the negative

Reflecting on negative feelings is just as important as reflecting on the positive. Understanding why you feel negative is key to becoming a fully-rounded individual, who is more able to deal with negative issues in the future.

#7) Don’t forget to breathe

Life throws various situations our way, with most of us experiencing some sort of stress on a regular basis. To manage your emotions when this happens and to avoid outbursts, don’t forget to breathe. Call a time out and go put some cold water on your face, go outside and get some fresh air or make a drink – anything to keep your cool and give yourself a chance to get a hold on what’s happening and how you should respond.

#8) A lifetime processUnderstand and remember that emotional intelligence is something you develop and requires continual improvement; it’s very much a lifetime practice.

A key component of emotional intelligence, self-awareness is the ability to recognise and understand your own character, moods and emotions and their effect on others. It includes a realistic self-assessment of what you’re capable of – your strengths and weaknesses – and knowing how others perceive you. It can help highlight areas for self-improvement, make you better at adapting and can limit wrongful decisions.

#9) Learn to look at yourself objectivelyKnowing yourself completely is difficult and it’s almost impossible to look at yourself objectively, so input from those who know you is vital. Ask them where your strengths and weaknesses lie, write down what they say and compare it. Look out for any patterns and remember not to argue with them – it doesn’t mean they’re right – they’re just trying to help you gauge your perception from another’s point of view.

#10) Keep a diaryA great way to get an accurate gauge of yourself is to keep a diary. Start by writing down what happened to you at the end of every day, how it made you feel and how you dealt with it. Documenting details like these will make you more aware of what you’re doing and will highlight where problems might be coming from. Periodically, look back over your comments and take note of any trends.

#11) Understand what motivates youEveryone has a core motivation when they begin a project. The difficulty is keeping this driving force in mind when adversity appears. All too often people start a project but fail to complete it because they lose their motivation to do so. Take time to understand what motivates you and use it to push you across the finish line.

#12) Take it easy

Sometimes emotional outbreaks occur because we don’t take the time out to slow down and process how we’re feeling. Give yourself a break and make a conscious effort to meditate, do yoga or read – a little escapism works wonders. And then the next time you have an emotional reaction to something, try to pause before you react.

#13) Acknowledge your emotional triggers

Self-aware individuals are able to recognise their emotions as they occur. It’s important to be flexible with your emotions and adapt them to your situation. Don’t deny your emotions stage time but don’t be rigid with them either, take the time to process your emotions before communicating them.

#14) Predict how you will feelThink about a situation you’re going into and predict how you will feel. Practice naming and accepting the feelings – naming the feeling puts you in control. Try to choose an appropriate reaction to the feeling rather than just reacting to it.



#15) Trust your intuitionIf you are still unsure about which path to take, trust your intuition. After all, your subconscious has been learning which path to take throughout your entire life.

Once you’ve gotten to grips with self-awareness and how your emotions work, you can get a handle on self-management. Which means taking responsibility for your own behaviour and well-being as well as controlling emotional outbursts.

#16) Snap out of itOne key way to keep your emotions in check is to change your sensory input – motion dictates emotion as the old saying goes. So jolt your physical body out of routine by attending an exercise class or try channelling a busy mind with a puzzle or a book – anything to break your existing routine.

#17) Maintain a schedule (and stick to it!)Ensuring that you create a schedule and stick to it is extremely important if you want to complete tasks effectively.

Paul Minors of Productivityist writes “When you schedule appointments in your calendar, you’re saying to yourself: “I’m going to do A, B and C by X date and it’s going to take Y hours. Once you make this promise, it becomes harder to procrastinate.”

#18) Eat well

This sounds like an easy one but regulating what you eat and drink can have a massive effect on your emotional state, so try your best to maintain a balanced diet.

#19) Don’t get mad

Funnel your emotional energy into something productive. It’s okay to keep overwhelming emotions inside, especially if it’s not an appropriate time to let them out. However, when you do, rather than vent it on something futile, turn it into motivation instead. Don’t get mad, get better.

#20) Be interestedA key factor in managing yourself and your emotions is consciously taken the time to be interested in the subject matter, whether it be business or personal.

#21) Don’t expect people to trust you (if you can’t trust them)

Establishing trust with a person can be difficult, and once it’s lost it’s very hard to regain. Try to be mindful that people are only human and will make mistakes. By offering your trust, you are inviting people to offer their trust in return.

#22) It’s your choiceYou have the ability to choose how you react to a situation – you can either overreact or remain calm. But it’s your choice.

A personal skills aspect of emotional intelligence, self-motivation refers to our inner drive to achieve and improve our commitment to our goals, our readiness to act on opportunities and our overall optimism.

#23) Personal goalsPersonal goals can provide long-term direction and short-term motivation. So grab a pen and paper and have a think about where you want to be and set some targets for yourself. Base them on your strengths and make them relevant to you and ultimately, make them exciting and achievable. This task alone is enough to get you instantly motivated!

#24) Be realisticWhen you’ve set a new goal, be sure to give yourself realistic and clear aims to achieving that goal and understand that change is an inevitable part of life. Achievement boosts confidence and as self-confidence rises so does the ability to achieve more, see how it works?

#25) Positive thinkingTo keep motivated it’s important to maintain a positive and optimistic mindset. See problems and setbacks as learning opportunities instead of failings and try to avoid negative people and opt to surround yourself with positive, well-motivated people – they’ll have a great effect on you.



#26) Lifelong learningBoth knowledge and information are key for feeding your mind and keeping you curious and motivated. And with information so easily accessible, you have the opportunity to fuel your values and passions at the click of a button!

#27) Be prepared to leave your comfort zoneThe biggest barrier to achieving your full potential is not challenging yourself frequently enough. Great things can happen to you if you’re willing to leave your comfort zone, so do so as often as you can.

#28) Help

Don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it, and vice versa. If others need help, don’t hold back in giving it to them. Seeing other people succeed will only help to motivate yourself.

#29) Stand and stretchFor an instant short term boost to your motivation, take a stand and stretch out as far as you can for 10 seconds. When you return to your desk, you’ll be in the correct frame of mind and ready to work.

Quite simply, empathy is the ability to understand other people’s emotions. Understanding that everyone has their own set of feelings, desires, triggers and fears. To be empathetic you’re allowing their experiences to resonate with your own in order to respond in an emotionally appropriate way. It’s a lifelong skill and the most important one for navigating relationships, and whilst it may not come naturally, there are a few ways it can be nurtured.

#30) Listen

Before you’re able to empathise with someone you first need to understand what it is they’re saying, which means listening is at the very epicentre of empathy. It involves letting them talk without interruption, preconceptions, scepticism and putting your own issues on pause to allow yourself to absorb their situation and consider how they are feeling before you react.

#31) Try to be approachableWhether you’re the leader of a team or working on a project with others, try to remain accessible and approachable.

#32) PerspectiveWe’re all familiar with the phrase “put yourself in their shoes”, and this is exactly that. The simplest way of gaining a little perspective the next time an issue or situation arises is to switch places with the other person and really think about what’s happening from their point of view. Sometimes there’s no right or wrong but at least you’ll understand enough to come to a resolve or offer some useful advice.

#33) Open yourself upOne of the quickest ways to offer a sincere exchange or sign of empathy is to listen to someone’s experiences and connect to it with a similar experience of your own. Don’t be afraid to open yourself up, it might just be the start of a great and lasting friendship.



#34) Immerse yourself in a new cultureThe old saying ‘travel broadens the mind’ is still true, even in this ever shrinking world. Sometimes the best way to open your mind is to jump on a plane and go somewhere completely different.

#35) Cultivate a curiosity about strangers

Highly empathetic people have an insatiable curiosity about strangers. When we talk to people outside of our usual social circle we learn about and begin to understand opinions, views and lives that are different to our own. So next time you’re sat on a bus you know just what to do…

#36) Acknowledge what people are sayingAnother useful tip is, whilst listening to what a person has to say, use acknowledgement words such as ‘I understand’ and ‘I see’ to show a person you’re listening (but of course only say these things if you are actually listening!).

In emotional intelligence terms, social skills refer to the skills needed to handle and influence other people’s emotions effectively. It covers a wide range of abilities, from communication and conflict management to dealing with change, meeting new people and building relationships and plays a part in almost every part of our lives, from work life to our romantic life. It’s complex and requires utilising almost every point we have already mentioned, but here are a few pointers for you.

#37) Get startedA good way to get started on improving your social skills is to isolate one skill you know you’d like to develop, this narrows it down and gives you focus. Internationally known psychologist, Daniel Goleman, suggests highlighting someone you know to be good at that particular skill, observing how they act and how they control their emotions and then implementing and applying that knowledge to yourself.

#38) Wear somebody else’s shoesNot literally of course! Everyone has heard the phrase ‘walk a mile in somebody else’s shoes’, but how many people actually practice this advice? Give it a try, you never know.

#39) Practice makes perfectThe idea of practising your social skills might sound strange, but like everything in life, practice makes perfect.

#40) Social media cold turkeyWe don’t mean to sound old, but taking your social life offline and engaging face-to-face with people will open up so many opportunities for you to gain and develop your social skills. So next time instead of instant messaging your best friend, meet up for a drink! Emotional intelligence doesn’t expand within the confines of (un) social media…

#41) Get networkingA good way to practise your social acumen is to attend local networking events. The great thing about these events is that everyone attending has a shared reason for attending.

#42) It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it

We’re talking about the importance of nonverbal communication and how that can affect a person’s opinion of you. Body language, tone of voice and eye contact is key to letting others know how you feel emotionally. So once you’ve got your emotions intact, think about how you’re physically coming across.

#43) The unknownThe ultimate method to building your social skills is to get out there and be sociable. It sounds simple, but you can’t strengthen your social skills without being social! Join a group or network outside of your usual circle; it’s the perfect way to put all of our tips into play.

Those with a high EQ very rarely display the following traits, something for you to be mindful of.

#44) DramaEmotionally intelligent people listen, offer sound advice and extend empathy to those who need it but they don’t permit others’ lives and emotions to effect or rule their own.

#45) ComplainingComplaining implies two things – one, that we are victims, and two, that there are no solutions to our problems. Rarely does an emotionally intelligent person feel victimised, and even more infrequently do they feel that a solution is beyond their grasp. So instead of looking for someone or something to blame, they think constructively and dissolve the solution in private.



#46) NegativityEmotionally intelligent people have the ability to kerb cynical thoughts. They acknowledge that negative thoughts are just that – thoughts – and rely on facts to come to conclusions as well as being able to silence or zone out any negativity.

#47) Dwelling on the pastThose with high emotional intelligence choose to learn from the mistakes and choices they have made and instead of dwelling on the past are mindful to live in the now.

#48) SelfishnessWhilst a degree of selfishness is required to get ahead in life, too much can fracture relationships and cause disharmony. Try to avoid being overly selfish and consider others needs.

#49) Giving in to peer pressureJust because everyone else does something, they don’t feel compelled to follow suit if they don’t want to. They think independently, and never conform just to please other people.

#50) Being overly criticalNothing destroys a person’s morale faster than being overly critical. Remember that people are only human and have the same motivations (and limitations) as you. Take the time to understand another person then communicate the change you want to see.

By understanding and successfully applying emotional intelligence, you too can reach your full potential and achieve your goals.

Success doesn’t come easy — even the most dedicated entrepreneur sometimes finds it tough to stay on track. It’s hard for businesses to keep their employees motivated all the time. I even find myself struggling with motivation on days when challenges feel insurmountable.

When I’m experiencing a rut, I look for sources of inspiration. That’s where motivational quotes come in. A good quote can remind me of why I love my role and the goals I want to achieve.

To keep your eyes on the prize, I gathered the 100+ top motivational quotes that can keep you going. Post these quotes on your office desk, send them in morning emails to your employees, or use them in your messaging system. Let’s dive in.



Table of Contents

Sometimes, I want bite-sized bits of information. I don’t want to read a novel (or even a paragraph) for that dose of inspiration. If you’re in a rush, check out my favorite short quotes about hard work.

You can write these quotes on your desk or use them as a daily motivation for your entrepreneurship journey. When it comes to a mantra, the shorter, the sweeter.

1. “Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard.” — Tim Notke, Basketball Coach



2. “Success is often achieved by those who don’t know that failure is inevitable.” — Coco Chanel, Fashion Designer

3. “Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.” — Maya Angelou, American Poet and Civil Rights Activist

4. “If your teacher, coach, or mentor believes you can do something, you’re more likely to do it.” — Gwen Moran, FastCompany



5. “Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do.” — Pele, Brazilian Soccer Player

6. “People who say it cannot be done should not interrupt those who are doing it.” — George Bernard Shaw, Playwright

7. “I do not know anyone who has got to the top without hard work. That is the recipe. It will not always get you to the top, but should get you pretty near.” — Margaret Thatcher, Former Prime Minister

8. “You can't get there by bus, only by hard work and risk and by not quite knowing what you're doing. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover will be yourself.” — Alan Alda, Actor



9. “I am who I am today because of the choices I made yesterday.” — Eleanor Roosevelt, First Lady of the U.S.

10. “Hard work spotlights the character of people: some turn up their sleeves, some turn up their noses, and some don’t turn up at all.” — Sam Ewing, Author

Every day has its highlights, but I usually feel a slump on Wednesday. When I’m feeling down during the mid-week, I use these quotes to find inspiration. I find it helpful to learn from the most successful person’s wisdom.

These quotes are also the perfect way to motivate your employees at the start of the month or when they have bigger goals. Try passing them along to your teams on Slack or via email.

1. “Whatever we believe about ourselves and our ability comes true for us.” — Susan L. Taylor, Journalist

The Truth About Success: Why Hard Work, Dedication, and Perseverance Are Key

Success is something that we all aspire to achieve in our lives. Whether it's in our personal or professional lives, success can give us a sense of fulfillment and purpose. However, the road to success is often long and winding, and it requires a lot of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. In this article, we'll take a closer look at why these three qualities are essential for achieving success, and we'll also hear from some young professionals who have achieved success through their own hard work and dedication.

Hard Work

Jordan Belfort once said, "The only thing standing between you and your goal is the story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it." This statement couldn't be truer when it comes to achieving success. Hard work is essential for achieving any goal, and it requires a lot of effort and dedication. Many entrepreneurs can attest to the importance of hard work when it comes to building a successful business. For example, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, worked tirelessly in the early days of the company, often putting in 80-hour workweeks to build the company from scratch.

Another example is the story of Ben Chestnut, the founder of Mailchimp. When he started the company in 2001, he worked out of his apartment and handled every aspect of the business himself. He would code during the day and do customer support at night, putting in long hours to ensure the success of his business.

Hard work is not just about putting in long hours, though. It's also about being willing to take risks and make sacrifices to achieve your goals. For example, Sara Blakely, the founder of Spanx, invested all of her savings into the business and even wrote her own patent to save money on legal fees. Her hard work and dedication paid off, and today, Spanx is a hugely successful company.

#hardwork #dedication #success #youngprofessionals #nevergiveup

Dedication

Dedication is another essential quality for achieving success. It means being committed to your goal and staying focused, even when the going gets tough. Dedication requires a lot of mental strength and resilience, and it's often what separates successful people from those who give up when faced with obstacles.

One example of dedication is the story of Brian Chesky, the co-founder of Airbnb. When he started the company in 2008, he and his co-founders had to do everything themselves, from designing the website to taking photographs of the listings. In the early days, they struggled to get funding and had to sell cereal to make ends meet. However, Chesky remained dedicated to his vision and kept pushing forward, and today, Airbnb is one of the most successful companies in the world.

Another example of dedication is the story of Sophia Amoruso, the founder of Nasty Gal. Amoruso started the company in 2006 by selling vintage clothes on eBay. She had no business experience, but she was dedicated to making her business a success. She would spend hours scouring thrift stores for unique pieces to sell, and eventually, her dedication paid off. Today, Nasty Gal is a successful clothing brand.

#dedication #success #youngprofessionals #nevergiveup

Perseverance

Perseverance is a crucial quality for achieving success in entrepreneurship. It's the ability to keep going, even when things get tough, and to overcome obstacles and setbacks along the way. Without perseverance, it's easy to give up when faced with challenges or setbacks, and this can lead to failure.

One example of perseverance is the story of Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba. Ma faced numerous setbacks and failures before finally achieving success with Alibaba. He failed his college entrance exams twice and was rejected from numerous jobs before starting his first business, which failed. Despite these setbacks, he remained determined to succeed and eventually founded Alibaba, which is now one of the largest e-commerce companies in the world.

Another example of perseverance is the story of James Dyson, the founder of Dyson. Dyson spent years developing his revolutionary vacuum cleaner, but he faced numerous setbacks along the way. He created over 5,000 prototypes before finally coming up with a design that worked, and he was rejected by numerous manufacturers before finally finding one who believed in his product. Dyson's perseverance paid off, and today, his company is a huge success.

Perseverance is also about being able to learn from failures and setbacks and to use them as opportunities for growth and improvement. As Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX and Tesla, once said, "Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough." Perseverance means being willing to take risks and to embrace failure as a natural part of the process.

Conclusion

In conclusion, entrepreneurship is a challenging but rewarding journey that requires a combination of qualities and skills. As we've seen, successful entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs, Sara Blakely, Jack Ma, and James Dyson all possess different qualities that have contributed to their success.

Innovation is crucial for entrepreneurship, and the ability to identify and solve problems is essential. Persistence is also key, and the willingness to keep going, even in the face of obstacles and setbacks, can make all the difference.

Entrepreneurship is not without risk, and failure is a natural part of the process. However, as Elon Musk has pointed out, failure is also an opportunity for growth and innovation.

Ultimately, the road to success in entrepreneurship is paved with hard work, determination, and a willingness to learn and adapt. By embodying the qualities of successful entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs, Sara Blakely, Jack Ma, and James Dyson, aspiring entrepreneurs can increase their chances of success.

# The Power of Hard Work and Dedication in Achieving Your Goals - Ellevate Football

How Your Determination Can Help You Overcome Any Obstacle

When it comes to achieving your goals, there's one thing that stands above everything else - hard work and dedication. Without these two qualities, it's almost impossible to achieve anything worthwhile. But with hard work and dedication, you can achieve your wildest dreams, no matter how big they are.

Here's a look at why hard work and dedication are so important and how you can cultivate these qualities to achieve your goals.

Success doesn't come easy. It takes hard work, perseverance, and a lot of dedication. The most successful people in the world didn't get where they are by accident. They put in the hours, the effort, and the hard work to achieve their goals.

Hard work is about putting in the time and effort to get things done. It's about going the extra mile, doing more than what's expected, and pushing yourself to be better than you were yesterday. When you work hard, you become better at what you do, and you develop a sense of discipline and commitment that will help you in all aspects of your life.

When you're dedicated to achieving your goals, you're willing to do whatever it takes to get there. You're willing to put in the extra hours, make sacrifices, and push yourself beyond your limits. Dedication is about staying focused on your goals and not letting anything get in the way of achieving them.

One of the biggest obstacles you'll face on your journey to achieving your goals is failure. It's easy to get discouraged when things don't go your way, but with dedication, you can overcome any obstacle that comes your way. Dedication gives you the strength to keep going even when things get tough, and it helps you stay focused on your goals even when the road ahead seems impossible.

Now that you understand the importance of hard work and dedication, let's take a look at how you can cultivate these qualities to achieve your goals.

The first step in cultivating hard work and dedication is setting clear goals. When you know what you want to achieve, it's easier to stay focused and motivated. Make sure your goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

Once you have clear goals, it's time to make a plan. Break your goals down into smaller, manageable steps, and create a roadmap to achieving them. A plan will help you stay organised, focused, and motivated, and it will help you track your progress along the way.

Now that you have a plan, it's time to get to work. Work hard, stay focused, and be dedicated to achieving your goals. Remember, success doesn't come overnight, so be patient and keep pushing forward.

Failure is a part of the journey to success. Embrace it, learn from it, and use it to motivate you to work even harder. Remember, every failure is an opportunity to learn and grow.

Maintaining a positive attitude is essential when you're working towards your goals. It's easy to get discouraged when things don't go your way, but staying positive will help you stay motivated and focused on your goals.

In the tapestry of life, dreams serve as the vibrant threads that weave our aspirations into reality. For many, the journey from envisioning a goal to achieving it is a testament to the power of hard work, dedication, and an unyielding belief in one's abilities. This narrative is not just a story of success but a testament to the indomitable human spirit that turns dreams into tangible achievements.

The Dream:

Every great journey begins with a dream—a vision of what could be, a glimpse of a better future. It is the dream that ignites the spark, lighting the path towards success. Whether it's a career goal, a personal ambition, or an entrepreneurial venture, dreams provide the fuel for the journey ahead.

The Power of Hard Work:

Dreams alone are but castles in the air; it is hard work that lays the foundation for those castles to touch the sky. Success is seldom handed on a silver platter; instead, it is earned through the sweat and toil of dedicated individuals. The late nights, the early mornings, and the persistence to push through challenges are the building blocks of achievement.

Dedication: The Steady Flame:

Dedication is the unwavering commitment to the pursuit of one's goals. It is the steady flame that withstands the winds of doubt and the storms of adversity. Dedication means staying focused on the dream even when the journey becomes arduous, and obstacles seem insurmountable. It is the glue that holds the pieces together when the road gets tough.

The Journey of Achievement:

The journey from dream to achievement is often marked by milestones, both big and small. Each accomplishment, no matter how modest, serves as a stepping stone towards the ultimate goal. The process of achievement is a mosaic of experiences, lessons learned, and personal growth. It is not just about reaching the destination but about evolving into the person capable of sustaining success.

The Sweet Taste of Success:

When hard work and dedication converge, success becomes more than a destination—it becomes a state of being. The sweet taste of success is not just in the accomplishment of the dream but in the realization that the journey was worth every sacrifice made. It is the sense of fulfillment that comes from knowing that one's efforts have borne fruit.

Dreams Come True:

The moment when dreams become reality is a magical one. It's a testament to the power of human potential, resilience, and the capacity to overcome obstacles. Whether it's landing the dream job, starting a successful business, or achieving a personal milestone, the realization of a dream is a powerful affirmation of the possibilities that exist when hard work and dedication are the guiding forces.

Conclusion:

The story of dreams coming true is not a fairy tale reserved for a select few; it is a narrative woven by those who dare to dream and are willing to put in the effort to see those dreams materialize. The journey from aspiration to accomplishment is a testament to the human spirit's ability to overcome challenges, adapt, and triumph. As we celebrate the stories of achievement, let them serve as inspiration for others to dream boldly, work diligently, and turn their aspirations into their own reality.

“an achievement is something that is accomplished particularly by great effort, courage, or special skills.”

The definition of achievement above gives us some clues to the key elements of feeling good about our work. That is, what goes into feeling accomplished.

Procrastination coach Cristina Roman has taken this definition of achievement a bit further and created a broader concept around it — you can watch her 8-min video here.

The gist is that there are three things you need to achieve a goal and feel good about it:

Therefore, feeling accomplished is the trifecta of courage, effort, and skill.

Which one you need more of today: courage, effort, or skill?

# Highly Skilled Professionals Want Your Work But Not Your Job

Companies today are facing a big talent-management challenge. They simply do not have the capabilities they need in-house to transform their offerings, processes, and infrastructures—and they’re increasingly unable to persuade highly skilled professionals to come on board full-time, despite making attractive offers.

In many fields—particularly technology, data sciences, and machine learning—the people with the most sought-after skills are freelancers. Integrating and managing a new “blended workforce” will be one of the main managerial challenges in the years ahead. Force-fitting the model used for temporary staff onto highly skilled freelancers won’t work, however. Firms must fully integrate these professionals into a highly cohesive internal team.

This article looks at successful efforts to manage the blended workforce at companies such as Microsoft, M&C Saatchi, and Mars and lays out some of the most helpful lessons they have learned.

As highly skilled professionals increasingly choose freelance work over in-house employment, companies are struggling to recruit and retain the talent they need to transform their offerings, processes, and infrastructures.

A new model for how work gets done is taking hold, one that blends in-house and freelance talent. In particular, the role of the manager is changing, along with the skills needed to respond to the very different needs, goals, and interests of these two groups.

This article looks at successful efforts to manage the blended workforce at companies such as Microsoft, M&C Saatchi, and Mars and lays out some of the most helpful lessons they have learned.

Marta, the CTO at a sporting goods  company, scans her operating metrics and flinches at the continued “red” status of her team’s technical capability. The board is concerned that upstart competition is nibbling away at market share, so Marta is under intense pressure to help the company move faster to market by implementing more-sophisticated digital and conversational AI capabilities. But her in-house talent lacks the deep expertise and experience necessary to transform the company’s offerings, processes, and data and security infrastructures, and her recruitment team has been unable to pry away top professionals from tech firms, despite making generous offers.

# Are you skilled or effective? – Performance Insight

By Dana Byrd



Skilled craftsman do a certain thing exceptionally well. Their efforts are precise and excellent. Someone who is “skilled” is a highly specialized expert. We can be highly skilled at nearly anything worth doing. But most of the time, we don’t need to be highly skilled at something. We need to be effective, and that means something different. To be effective means to produce a desired effect. To do so, we usually need to be able to do a variety of things reasonably well, not just one thing extremely well. We need to be a jack-of-all-traders of sorts, with a multitude of tools at our disposal and, just as importantly, the ability to know when to use which one. From a leadership and management perspective, this means learning how to balance various orientations and behaviors. For example:

While the professional world is becoming highly specialized in terms of technical skills, having too narrow a focus or skillset can decrease our adaptability and effectiveness, especially when it comes to key management and leadership competencies. While our company has the expertise to provide training and development around these concepts, our real value to our clients isn’t just providing skill-building opportunities and offering tools for various problems, but in helping people cultivate a diverse skill set and the insight to apply it flexibly and thoughtfully.

“If you only have a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.” –Abraham Maslow

# 20 Best Skills to Put on Your Resume (With Examples) | FlexJobs

By Jessica Howington, Senior Content Manager



Writing a good resume is a difficult balancing act. Sometimes it can be a challenge to keep your resume length short and sweet while also including enough quality information to make a lasting impression.

Hiring managers will also hold a particular interest in the skill set you possess. This means it’s very important to know what is relevant to the job when thinking of good skills to put on a resume. And though it goes without saying, we’ll say it just in case: any job skills listed on your resume should be skills you truly possess. 

So, how do you figure out the best skills to put on a resume? And what if you’re looking to find a remote job? Let’s take a closer look at resume skill examples and the skills section of your resume.

Note:

FlexJobs is the longtime leader in helping job seekers find the highest-quality remote, work-from-home, hybrid, and flexible jobs. You can sign up for premium-level access to our database of hand-screened job listings, as well as job search and career webinars, and many other great resources! Learn today how FlexJobs can empower your job search!

While you can add a number of skills to your resume, it’s best to focus on the types of skills that will land you the job. The below lists will help you organize the top soft skills and top hard skills to showcase to employers!

There are tons of soft skills (personal skills) that you can include in your resume, but how do you know which ones to include? Here is a quick list of soft skills examples you should list on your resume.

No matter what the job is, eventually something will go wrong and employers want to know that you’re capable of coming up with a quick and effective solution. In fact, there are jobs that are essentially nothing but solving problems for the company, the clients, or both.

Being able to think rationally and thoughtfully is the basis of critical thinking. Employers want workers who can think through a problem or a project and determine the best steps needed. Critical thinkers come up with new and better ways to work, making it an invaluable skill to put on a resume.

Many organizations and industries covet employees who are dynamic and adaptable to every situation, or who have a natural ability to use a variety of methods and approaches in different circumstances to get the best end result.

Whether it’s written or verbal, being able to communicate with your boss, coworkers, and clients/customers in all situations is very valuable. The better you are at it, the better results you will generate.

Most jobs will require you to work with other people at some point, and employers want to know that you can succeed in a team environment. Some jobs will prize this skill more than others.

This is not just about having a neat desk, but organizing tasks and projects for your coworkers, management, and at the very least, yourself! If you want to show off your organization skills, having a tightly structured resume certainly helps.

Thinking outside of the box and coming up with creative solutions can be a real asset in any role. Perhaps you’re good at thinking about something in a way that hasn’t been done before. Creativity can be shown on your resume through a problem you solved or through a creative skill like writing or design.

According to Psychology Today, “Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to identify and manage one’s own emotions, as well as the emotions of others.” In the workplace, this means you’re rational and even-keeled, and can handle ups and downs without losing control. While this is important for everybody, it’s a must-have skill to include on a resume for management.

On the job you need to ensure you follow all instructions in order to complete your work. This can be especially important when you work with others. Paying attention to detail will be needed at any role you have. Consider times when you caught or fixed a potential mistake due to your attention to detail.

Part of being a good employee is taking responsibility for your duties and even owning up to mistakes. Most managers don’t want to have to check in on their employees to ensure every part of their job is getting done. Responsibility means doing what you need to do to complete your tasks.

Hard skills tend to be more technical, and each industry or type of job will usually have its own required set. Finding out which professional skills you’ll be expected to have in your field might require some research. Here are hard skills examples that tend to be in-demand across many industries.

The list of professions that do not require you to use computers and certain types of software is very short. You could very likely break up “digital skills” into two or three specific technical proficiencies for your field. Most jobs require computer skills, including experience with video meeting software, project management programs, and other company related software.

Aside from the obvious professions like graphic or web design, there are jobs in marketing, advertising, branding, engineering, and construction that require some type of design skills—even if it’s only for drawing up presentations.

Understand that data is very much in vogue right now, and there are a lot of jobs out there where you will be called upon to analyze metrics and extrapolate a practical use from it, making analytical skills extremely valuable to put on your resume.

There are many jobs that involve selling a product or service, purchasing stock or merchandise, brokering deals for production or transportation, establishing partnerships for advertising or investments, and so on.

Finance, business, engineering, construction, manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and operations will require you to be competent with math in some capacity. If you’re in a profession that is more math-heavy, consider splitting it up into a few more specific skills areas.

Many jobs will require project management skills. The ability to manage your task flow and complete assignments on time is part of project management. Perhaps you have used project management software in the past or have completed a project early—these all show good project management.

Marketing involves selling and promoting products and services. Even if you’re not a marketer per se, many companies may desire this hard skill. Knowing the highlights and benefits of your company’s products and services, and being able to speak or write about them, can be valuable to many different jobs. If you have specific marketing or social media experience, even better.

Even if your job is not administrative in nature, it’s likely a part of your role. Administrative skills involve the things you do to manage your role: organizing, planning, scheduling, writing emails, managing files, etc. Employers want to know you’re able to take hold of the details.

Many jobs involve writing. Whether it’s to clients or coworkers, having a basic writing ability is necessary and an absolute skill to put on your resume. Emails filled with typos and grammatical errors will not reflect well on you, and poor tone can send the wrong message. Demonstrate this skill through your cover letter and emails with the recruiter, and list any specific writing-heavy projects you’ve completed.

Being bilingual can be a great hard skill and set you apart from your competition. Even if a role or company doesn’t initially have a need for a bilingual employee, they may look favorably on your ability. It is common to need someone with fluency in another language to help customers or clients, so play up this skill on your resume.

Are you bilingual or multilingual? FlexJobs can help you find job opportunities specific to the languages you speak. Browse Spanish jobs, Chinese jobs, German jobs, French jobs and more.

If you’re still not sure if any of these resume skills are right for your situation, one quick way to check which job skills the employer is seeking is to check the job description.

Read through it a few times, and you’ll likely spot three or four key skills mentioned several times throughout the document. If that’s the case, you should focus on those skills for resume relevance.

There are endless skills that you can include on any resume or resume profile, and you have to decide which ones will be the most effective. There are hard, industry-specific technical skills, as well as soft skills that every job demands. Knowing the right skills to put on resume profiles can improve your chances of landing an interview.

Hard skills are technical abilities that are specific to a particular job and are often measurable. For software developers, their set of hard skills would include specific programming languages.

Soft skills are personal skills or creative abilities that can come naturally or be strengthened over time. Some examples of soft skills are adaptability, self-motivation, people skills, time management, and the ability to work under pressure.

“Some great skills employers love to see on your resume if you are looking for remote work are: written and verbal communication, the ability to work independently, time and task management, organization, comfort with technology, and specific knowledge of remote communication tools like Zoom, Skype, Dropbox, Google Suite, etc.,” shared Toni Frana, FlexJobs’ lead career expert.

If you are applying for a sales job, your prior experience as a car mechanic is not the most relevant. You will want to emphasize experience and key strengths that can be applicable to a sales role. However, if you lack the experience, search through your existing positions for relevant job skills.

For example, if you were responsible for providing customer service as a mechanic, that is a transferable skill that can be relevant to a sales role.

Modern resumes are built to be value-oriented, which requires providing information that is more achievement-based as opposed to task-based. If you’ve had multiple roles with varying achievements, select the top four you are most proud of and incorporate them into a Career Highlights section.

Try to avoid adding more than four as this section is meant to be the highlights of your achievements, and you don’t want to create sections with long lists of bullets, creating a very boring way to read content.

If you are higher up in your career level, you likely have multiple responsibilities that cross several platforms or departments. If you are an operations manager at a company, your responsibilities may include: managing staff, maintaining smooth daily operations, communicating with key stakeholders and/or vendors, developing and managing projects, and hiring and training staff.

With either your task-based information or achievements, you can categorize the content into sections to illustrate the types of skills in your responsibilities.

For example:

Your soft skills and hard skills are the very things that will either qualify you or disqualify you for a job. Be sure to include some of these top skills on your resume for maximum results.

Harvard Business School Online's Business Insights Blog provides the career insights you need to achieve your goals and gain confidence in your business skills.

Emotional intelligence is a crucial component of leadership. Your ability to manage your emotions, as well as recognize and influence others’, has been considered one of the strongest indicators of workplace performance. Research shows that 90 percent of top performers are high in emotional intelligence.

Technical skills will only get you so far. If you’re an aspiring or current leader, you need to build your emotional intelligence to bring out the best in others and cultivate high-performing teams.

“Leaders prime the emotional state of the organization,” said Travis Bradberry, president of emotional intelligence provider TalentSmart, to the Society for Human Resource Management. “When they’re ineffective, when they set poor examples of how they treat other people, that trickles down throughout the company.”

Emotional intelligence, also known as emotional quotient or EQ, is the ability to understand and manage your emotions and the emotions of others. 

Similar to IQ, emotional intelligence can be measured through various assessments, but IQ represents cognitive abilities while EQ is a measure of one’s emotional capabilities. 

While emotional intelligence is beneficial for everyone, it’s especially important for those in leadership positions. Emotionally intelligent leaders can empathize with others, communicate effectively, and manage conflict. All of these abilities are qualities of effective leaders.

If you want to enhance your leadership capabilities, here are five emotional intelligence skills you need and ways you can develop them.

Self-awareness is having a clear understanding of your strengths, limitations, emotions, beliefs, and motivations. It sounds simple enough, yet 79 percent of executives surveyed by organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry had at least one blind spot—or a skill they ranked among their strongest that others reported as a weakness.

Leaders who are adept at recognizing and managing their emotions are better equipped to perceive others’ feelings and know how to motivate employees. Those who don’t could see a slip in performance: Research in the  Harvard Business Review found that teams with individuals who lack self-awareness make worse decisions and are less effective at conflict management.

By acknowledging your weaknesses, you can build trust and transparency among your team. You can also own your professional development by knowing the areas in which you need to improve in order to advance your career.

Self-regulation refers to how you manage your emotions, behaviors, and impulses. The more self-aware you are, the easier this becomes; if you can recognize what you’re feeling and why, you can respond appropriately.

“In my experience, I’ve never seen the tendency toward radical outbursts to surface as an indicator of strong leadership,” writes Daniel Goleman, the psychologist who popularized emotional intelligence, on his website.

If prone to emotional outbursts or overreacting, there are tactics you can use to improve your self-regulation, such as:

If you acknowledge your emotions and give yourself time to process them, you can carefully craft how you respond and avoid doing anything that could jeopardize the goodwill you’ve worked hard to build.

Empathy is the capability of understanding another person’s experiences and emotions, and has been ranked as the top leadership skill needed today by global consulting firm DDI. According to DDI's research, leaders who excel at listening and responding with empathy perform more than 40 percent higher in coaching, planning, and decision-making.

According to a separate survey by Businessolver, 96 percent of employees rank empathy as important, but 92 percent say it’s undervalued. It shouldn’t be, though: Companies that prioritize empathy experience an increase in revenue, retention, and productivity.

By actively listening to your employees and taking the time to understand their wants and needs, you can boost engagement, build trust, and more effectively coach them through challenges. The more your team feels appreciated, the more invested they’ll be, which, in turn, leads to higher morale and stronger company culture.

Motivation refers to your ability to inspire both yourself and others to action. Here, it’s essential to lead by example. Self-motivated leaders care more about hitting organizational milestones than monetary awards. They set goals, take initiative, rise to the challenge, and stay optimistic during turbulent times.

The more positive you are, the more confident your team will feel. Your intrinsic motivation will permeate the organization, and you’ll have a better understanding of how to empower employees.

Social skills are all about how you perceive emotions and interact and communicate with others. For example, emotionally intelligent leaders can walk into a room of employees with pursed lips and clenched fists and not only sense the tension, but know how to address and resolve the conflict before it escalates.

The more in tune you are with your emotions, the easier it will be to assess others’. And if you can assess others’ feelings, you can more easily build and maintain relationships. Leaders with strong social skills know they can’t achieve success alone. Surpassing goals and reaching milestones requires collaboration, communication, and a shared vision.

Related: How to Give Feedback Effectively

If you have gaps in your current skill set, there are actions you can take to boost your emotional intelligence. Methods include:

At the end of the workday, reflect on how your meetings, projects, and interactions went—whether positive or negative. By writing your thoughts down, you can spot specific patterns about your behaviors and reactions, as well as others’.

Where did you excel? How are your employees feeling? Are there certain people or situations that frustrated you and, if so, why? The more introspective you are, the better. For example, you’ll become more aware of what upsets you, so that you can avoid a future outburst, or mimic actions that have proven to boost employee morale.

In a 360-degree assessment, you solicit feedback from your manager, colleagues, and peers, while also undergoing an individual self-assessment. Through the process, you can gain valuable insights into what your co-workers perceive as your strengths and weaknesses, as well as uncover any blind spots you might have.

According to Jack Zenger, CEO of leadership development firm Zenger Folkman, more than 85 percent of all Fortune 500 companies use 360-degree feedback. It can help improve leaders’ self-awareness, which, in turn, can result in improved workplace effectiveness, less stress, and stronger relationships.

According to Psychology Today, only about 10 percent of people listen effectively. It’s easy to get distracted by technology, background noise, and your own thoughts. Yet, to be an effective communicator and emotionally intelligent leader, you need to be a good listener. 

To become more emotionally intelligent, practice active listening. Try to focus on what the speaker is saying and show that you’re engaged by paraphrasing and using other non-verbal cues like nodding. By actively listening at work, it will be easier to connect with others and truly understand their thoughts and feelings.

To understand the emotions of others, you need to understand your own first.

When you catch yourself feeling a particularly strong emotion, whether it’s a positive or negative one, make a conscious effort to think about what you’re feeling. Take a second and consider why you’re feeling this way and what might have triggered such a strong emotional response.

This will help you become more aware of your own emotions and better understand your colleagues’. As an empathetic leader, you’ll be able to cultivate a high-performing team.





If you’re interested in diving deeper into emotional intelligence and enhancing your leadership capabilities, taking an online leadership course or training could be the best next step.

Online courses offer working professionals the flexibility to complete coursework on their schedule and connect with a global community of like-minded peers, all while gaining new skills and knowledge.

One program to consider is Harvard Business School Online’s Leadership Principles course, which provides a 360-degree assessment to help you better understand who you are as a leader and how others perceive you.

          An overview of the importance of Emotional Intelligence for your own success and the success of your organization.
        

Blog

Today’s in-demand skills are increasingly technical in nature. However, there’s a corresponding need for the uniquely human ability to work with and through others to accomplish important goals.

Enter emotional intelligence (EI), a set of skills that help us recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions as well as recognize, understand and influence the emotions of others.

We recently spoke with Margaret Andrews, instructor of Emotional Intelligence in Leadership, about how people can build EI for better interpersonal relations. Andrews is the former associate dean at Harvard University’s Division of Continuing Education and executive director at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

“Emotional intelligence is critical in building and maintaining relationships and influencing others — key skills that help people throughout their career and wherever they sit in an organizational structure,” says Andrews.

Additionally, research suggests that people with a high emotional quotient (EQ) are more innovative and have higher job satisfaction than those with lower EQs.

Let’s dive into what exactly EI entails, and how you can improve on this essential component of successful relationships.

Emotional intelligence is a set of skills and behaviors. While some people will be naturally more adept at certain aspects, EI can be learned, developed, and enhanced.

The four main components of EI are self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness, and social skills:

Self-awareness is the ability to identify and understand your own emotions and the impact we have on others. It’s the cornerstone of emotional intelligence and the other components of EI depend on this self-awareness.

“It all starts with self-awareness, which is foundation of EI, and it builds from there. If you’re aware of your own emotions and the behaviors they trigger, you can begin to manage these emotions and behaviors,” says Andrews.

Our emotions impact our mood, behaviors, performance, and interactions with other people. “We are all having emotions all the time,” says Andrews, “the question is whether you are aware of these emotions and the impact they have on your behavior — and other people.”

According to Tasha Eurich, an organizational psychologist, researcher, and author of Insight, people who are self-aware tend to be more confident and more creative. They also make better decisions, build stronger relationships, and communicate more effectively.

Self-awareness opens the door to self-regulation, which is the ability to manage these emotions and behaviors. Once we’re aware of our emotions, we can begin to manage them and keep the disruptive emotions and impulses under control.

“People with strong self-regulation can pause and take a deep breath in tense and stressful situations, explains Andrews, “which helps them remain calm and think before they speak or act.”

These people tend toward a positive outlook and are adaptable to a variety of situations and circumstances. “On the flip side,” she says, “those that cannot contain their negative emotions and impulses often set off a chain reaction of negative emotions in others.”

“There’s an old adage that people join organizations and leave managers,” says Andrews, “and it’s true. So, companies — or managers — that have high turnover rates should take a look in the mirror.”

Social awareness is our ability to understand the emotions of others and a key component of this is empathy.

Jamil Zaki, a Stanford professor and author of The War for Kindness, describes empathy as having three components — identifying what others feel, sharing this emotion, and wishing to improve their experience.

“It’s not about how you would feel in their situation, but rather, how they actually feel,” says Andrews.

People with strong social awareness tend toward kindness. However, this doesn’t mean they cannot give others difficult feedback — in fact, they may be better at delivering this ‘tough love’ because they understand the other person and want to help them improve.

“Social skills are what separate a great manager from a good one,” says Andrews.

These skills, which include influence, conflict management, teamwork, and the ability to inspire others, make it possible to build and maintain healthy relationships in all parts of your life.

People with strong social skills can make an enormous difference on a team and in organizations because they understand others and act on this knowledge to move people toward a common goal.

To improve your emotional intelligence, you need to start at the beginning, with self-awareness. However, gauging your self-awareness is innately difficult because, as Andrews puts it, “you don’t know what you don’t know.”

Without an objective sense of who you are and what drives you, it’s nearly impossible to be emotionally intelligent. Andrews cites a study by Tasha Eurich which found that 95 percent of participants gave themselves high marks in self-awareness.

However, using more empirical measures of self-awareness, the study found that only 10-15 percent of the cohort was truly self-aware.

That’s a pretty big gap, and one that suggests most of us aren’t very self-aware. What’s worse, research also shows that managers and CEOs may be the least self-aware of all. This is not despite their authority, but quite possibly because of it.

Eurich wrote in the Harvard Business Review that the more power someone obtains, the more likely they are to be overconfident about how well they know themselves. After all, those at the top of the chain have fewer people giving them feedback.

Often, when managers do receive feedback from employees, it isn’t as honest as it might be because subordinates are afraid of incurring negative consequences. Managers are insulated from criticism, and as a result, self-awareness sinks.

Receiving honest, constructive feedback is key to becoming self-aware. Andrews notes that a 360-degree emotional intelligence assessment can be a very effective way to gain insight into your EI-components and the impact you have on others.

“Many people shrug off differences in how they rate themselves versus how others rate them on EI competencies by saying that they’re too hard on themselves or that others don’t really understand their intent,” says Andrews, “but really it shows a lack of self-awareness.”

Emotional intelligence is a set of skills and behaviors that can be learned and developed. Here are some telltale signs of people with low EQ and those with high EQ.

People with low EQ:

People with high EQ:

Developing emotional intelligence is an ongoing process. The journey differs from person to person. Nonetheless, according to Andrews, the following actions may lead you to better self-awareness, empathy, and social skills.

What emotions are you feeling right now? Can you name them? When in a stressful situation, what emotions typically arise? How would you like to respond in these situations? Can you stop to pause and reconsider your response? Taking a moment to name your feelings and temper your reactivity is an integral step toward EI.

Audit your self-perception by asking managers, colleagues, friends, or family how they would rate your emotional intelligence. For example, ask them about how you respond to difficult situations, how adaptable or empathetic you are, and/or how well you handle conflict. It may not always be what you want to hear, but it will often be what you need to hear.

Studies show that reading literature with complex characters can improve empathy. Reading stories from other people’s perspectives helps us gain insight into their thoughts, motivations, and actions and may help enhance your social awareness.

Building E.I. in yourself is one thing, but influencing others to adopt a more empathetic mindset can be a challenge. To create a culture of high EQ, managers and supervisors must model emotionally intelligent behavior.

“If you want to change how your organization does in EI, you can set norms for how people communicate and how they disagree,” says Andrews.

In addition, you need to recognize and celebrate those that exhibit emotional intelligence.;

“Start making heroes of people who help other people,” says Andrews. “It’s not just the person who got to the top of the mountain first — it’s all the people who helped them. If you want to encourage good team behavior, recognize it, and call it out for what it is.”

        Emotional Intelligence


Emotional intelligence fuels your performance both in the workplace and in your personal life, but it starts with you. From your confidence, empathy and optimism to your social skills and self-control, understanding and managing your own emotions can accelerate success in all areas of your life.

No matter what professional field you are in, whether you manage a team of two or 20, or even just yourself, realising how effective you are at controlling your own emotional energy is a great starting point. Absent from the curriculum, emotional intelligence isn’t something we are taught or tested on, so where did it come from, what is it, do you have it and is it really that important?

Fortunately, it is something you can learn and we’ve compiled a comprehensive list of tips to help you explore your own level of emotional intelligence and gain important emotional intelligence skills that can be implemented into everyday life. Some of these tips we follow ourselves and others have been revealed to us by our amazing clients and partners who know how to motivate and inspire their teams but first and foremost, themselves.

1. Emotional Intelligence2. Self-awareness3. Self-management4. Motivation5. Empathy6. Social skills7. What to avoid

 

Put simply, Emotional Intelligence is how well individuals identify and manage their own emotions and react to the emotions of others. It’s understanding how those emotions shape your thoughts and actions so you can have greater control over your behaviour and develop the skills to manage yourself more effectively. Becoming more emotionally conscious allows us to grow and gain a deeper understanding of who we are, enabling us to communicate better with others and build stronger relationships.

We suggest starting with these initial 8 tips, they provide a good starting point to discovering the foundations of your emotional intelligence.

#1) Practice observing how you feelOften we lead hectic, busy lifestyles and it’s all too easy for us to lose touch with our emotions. To reconnect, try setting a timer for various points during the day. When the timer goes off, take a few deep breaths and notice how you’re feeling emotionally. Pay attention to where that emotion is showing up as a physical feeling in your body and what the sensation feels like. The more you practice, the more it will become second nature.

#2) Pay attention to how you behaveWhile you’re practising your emotional awareness, take the time to notice your behaviour too. Observe how you act when you’re experiencing certain emotions, and how that affects your day-to-day life. Managing our emotions becomes easier once we become more conscious of how we react to them.

#3) Question your own opinionsIn this hyper-connected world, it is easy to fall into an ‘opinion bubble’. This is a state of existence where your own opinions are constantly re-enforced by people with similar viewpoints. Take time to read the other side of the story and have your views challenged (even if you still feel they are right). This will help you understand other people and be more receptive to new ideas.

#4) Take responsibility for your feelingsYour emotions and behaviour come from you, they don’t come from anyone else and once you start accepting responsibility for how you feel and how you behave it will have a positive impact on all areas of your life.



#5) Take time to celebrate the positiveA key part emotional intelligence is celebrating and reflecting on the positive moments in life. People who experience positive emotions are generally more resilient and more likely to have fulfilling relationships, which will help them move past adversity.

#6) But don’t ignore the negative

Reflecting on negative feelings is just as important as reflecting on the positive. Understanding why you feel negative is key to becoming a fully-rounded individual, who is more able to deal with negative issues in the future.

#7) Don’t forget to breathe

Life throws various situations our way, with most of us experiencing some sort of stress on a regular basis. To manage your emotions when this happens and to avoid outbursts, don’t forget to breathe. Call a time out and go put some cold water on your face, go outside and get some fresh air or make a drink – anything to keep your cool and give yourself a chance to get a hold on what’s happening and how you should respond.

#8) A lifetime processUnderstand and remember that emotional intelligence is something you develop and requires continual improvement; it’s very much a lifetime practice.

A key component of emotional intelligence, self-awareness is the ability to recognise and understand your own character, moods and emotions and their effect on others. It includes a realistic self-assessment of what you’re capable of – your strengths and weaknesses – and knowing how others perceive you. It can help highlight areas for self-improvement, make you better at adapting and can limit wrongful decisions.

#9) Learn to look at yourself objectivelyKnowing yourself completely is difficult and it’s almost impossible to look at yourself objectively, so input from those who know you is vital. Ask them where your strengths and weaknesses lie, write down what they say and compare it. Look out for any patterns and remember not to argue with them – it doesn’t mean they’re right – they’re just trying to help you gauge your perception from another’s point of view.

#10) Keep a diaryA great way to get an accurate gauge of yourself is to keep a diary. Start by writing down what happened to you at the end of every day, how it made you feel and how you dealt with it. Documenting details like these will make you more aware of what you’re doing and will highlight where problems might be coming from. Periodically, look back over your comments and take note of any trends.

#11) Understand what motivates youEveryone has a core motivation when they begin a project. The difficulty is keeping this driving force in mind when adversity appears. All too often people start a project but fail to complete it because they lose their motivation to do so. Take time to understand what motivates you and use it to push you across the finish line.

#12) Take it easy

Sometimes emotional outbreaks occur because we don’t take the time out to slow down and process how we’re feeling. Give yourself a break and make a conscious effort to meditate, do yoga or read – a little escapism works wonders. And then the next time you have an emotional reaction to something, try to pause before you react.

#13) Acknowledge your emotional triggers

Self-aware individuals are able to recognise their emotions as they occur. It’s important to be flexible with your emotions and adapt them to your situation. Don’t deny your emotions stage time but don’t be rigid with them either, take the time to process your emotions before communicating them.

#14) Predict how you will feelThink about a situation you’re going into and predict how you will feel. Practice naming and accepting the feelings – naming the feeling puts you in control. Try to choose an appropriate reaction to the feeling rather than just reacting to it.



#15) Trust your intuitionIf you are still unsure about which path to take, trust your intuition. After all, your subconscious has been learning which path to take throughout your entire life.

Once you’ve gotten to grips with self-awareness and how your emotions work, you can get a handle on self-management. Which means taking responsibility for your own behaviour and well-being as well as controlling emotional outbursts.

#16) Snap out of itOne key way to keep your emotions in check is to change your sensory input – motion dictates emotion as the old saying goes. So jolt your physical body out of routine by attending an exercise class or try channelling a busy mind with a puzzle or a book – anything to break your existing routine.

#17) Maintain a schedule (and stick to it!)Ensuring that you create a schedule and stick to it is extremely important if you want to complete tasks effectively.

Paul Minors of Productivityist writes “When you schedule appointments in your calendar, you’re saying to yourself: “I’m going to do A, B and C by X date and it’s going to take Y hours. Once you make this promise, it becomes harder to procrastinate.”

#18) Eat well

This sounds like an easy one but regulating what you eat and drink can have a massive effect on your emotional state, so try your best to maintain a balanced diet.

#19) Don’t get mad

Funnel your emotional energy into something productive. It’s okay to keep overwhelming emotions inside, especially if it’s not an appropriate time to let them out. However, when you do, rather than vent it on something futile, turn it into motivation instead. Don’t get mad, get better.

#20) Be interestedA key factor in managing yourself and your emotions is consciously taken the time to be interested in the subject matter, whether it be business or personal.

#21) Don’t expect people to trust you (if you can’t trust them)

Establishing trust with a person can be difficult, and once it’s lost it’s very hard to regain. Try to be mindful that people are only human and will make mistakes. By offering your trust, you are inviting people to offer their trust in return.

#22) It’s your choiceYou have the ability to choose how you react to a situation – you can either overreact or remain calm. But it’s your choice.

A personal skills aspect of emotional intelligence, self-motivation refers to our inner drive to achieve and improve our commitment to our goals, our readiness to act on opportunities and our overall optimism.

#23) Personal goalsPersonal goals can provide long-term direction and short-term motivation. So grab a pen and paper and have a think about where you want to be and set some targets for yourself. Base them on your strengths and make them relevant to you and ultimately, make them exciting and achievable. This task alone is enough to get you instantly motivated!

#24) Be realisticWhen you’ve set a new goal, be sure to give yourself realistic and clear aims to achieving that goal and understand that change is an inevitable part of life. Achievement boosts confidence and as self-confidence rises so does the ability to achieve more, see how it works?

#25) Positive thinkingTo keep motivated it’s important to maintain a positive and optimistic mindset. See problems and setbacks as learning opportunities instead of failings and try to avoid negative people and opt to surround yourself with positive, well-motivated people – they’ll have a great effect on you.



#26) Lifelong learningBoth knowledge and information are key for feeding your mind and keeping you curious and motivated. And with information so easily accessible, you have the opportunity to fuel your values and passions at the click of a button!

#27) Be prepared to leave your comfort zoneThe biggest barrier to achieving your full potential is not challenging yourself frequently enough. Great things can happen to you if you’re willing to leave your comfort zone, so do so as often as you can.

#28) Help

Don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it, and vice versa. If others need help, don’t hold back in giving it to them. Seeing other people succeed will only help to motivate yourself.

#29) Stand and stretchFor an instant short term boost to your motivation, take a stand and stretch out as far as you can for 10 seconds. When you return to your desk, you’ll be in the correct frame of mind and ready to work.

Quite simply, empathy is the ability to understand other people’s emotions. Understanding that everyone has their own set of feelings, desires, triggers and fears. To be empathetic you’re allowing their experiences to resonate with your own in order to respond in an emotionally appropriate way. It’s a lifelong skill and the most important one for navigating relationships, and whilst it may not come naturally, there are a few ways it can be nurtured.

#30) Listen

Before you’re able to empathise with someone you first need to understand what it is they’re saying, which means listening is at the very epicentre of empathy. It involves letting them talk without interruption, preconceptions, scepticism and putting your own issues on pause to allow yourself to absorb their situation and consider how they are feeling before you react.

#31) Try to be approachableWhether you’re the leader of a team or working on a project with others, try to remain accessible and approachable.

#32) PerspectiveWe’re all familiar with the phrase “put yourself in their shoes”, and this is exactly that. The simplest way of gaining a little perspective the next time an issue or situation arises is to switch places with the other person and really think about what’s happening from their point of view. Sometimes there’s no right or wrong but at least you’ll understand enough to come to a resolve or offer some useful advice.

#33) Open yourself upOne of the quickest ways to offer a sincere exchange or sign of empathy is to listen to someone’s experiences and connect to it with a similar experience of your own. Don’t be afraid to open yourself up, it might just be the start of a great and lasting friendship.



#34) Immerse yourself in a new cultureThe old saying ‘travel broadens the mind’ is still true, even in this ever shrinking world. Sometimes the best way to open your mind is to jump on a plane and go somewhere completely different.

#35) Cultivate a curiosity about strangers

Highly empathetic people have an insatiable curiosity about strangers. When we talk to people outside of our usual social circle we learn about and begin to understand opinions, views and lives that are different to our own. So next time you’re sat on a bus you know just what to do…

#36) Acknowledge what people are sayingAnother useful tip is, whilst listening to what a person has to say, use acknowledgement words such as ‘I understand’ and ‘I see’ to show a person you’re listening (but of course only say these things if you are actually listening!).

In emotional intelligence terms, social skills refer to the skills needed to handle and influence other people’s emotions effectively. It covers a wide range of abilities, from communication and conflict management to dealing with change, meeting new people and building relationships and plays a part in almost every part of our lives, from work life to our romantic life. It’s complex and requires utilising almost every point we have already mentioned, but here are a few pointers for you.

#37) Get startedA good way to get started on improving your social skills is to isolate one skill you know you’d like to develop, this narrows it down and gives you focus. Internationally known psychologist, Daniel Goleman, suggests highlighting someone you know to be good at that particular skill, observing how they act and how they control their emotions and then implementing and applying that knowledge to yourself.

#38) Wear somebody else’s shoesNot literally of course! Everyone has heard the phrase ‘walk a mile in somebody else’s shoes’, but how many people actually practice this advice? Give it a try, you never know.

#39) Practice makes perfectThe idea of practising your social skills might sound strange, but like everything in life, practice makes perfect.

#40) Social media cold turkeyWe don’t mean to sound old, but taking your social life offline and engaging face-to-face with people will open up so many opportunities for you to gain and develop your social skills. So next time instead of instant messaging your best friend, meet up for a drink! Emotional intelligence doesn’t expand within the confines of (un) social media…

#41) Get networkingA good way to practise your social acumen is to attend local networking events. The great thing about these events is that everyone attending has a shared reason for attending.

#42) It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it

We’re talking about the importance of nonverbal communication and how that can affect a person’s opinion of you. Body language, tone of voice and eye contact is key to letting others know how you feel emotionally. So once you’ve got your emotions intact, think about how you’re physically coming across.

#43) The unknownThe ultimate method to building your social skills is to get out there and be sociable. It sounds simple, but you can’t strengthen your social skills without being social! Join a group or network outside of your usual circle; it’s the perfect way to put all of our tips into play.

Those with a high EQ very rarely display the following traits, something for you to be mindful of.

#44) DramaEmotionally intelligent people listen, offer sound advice and extend empathy to those who need it but they don’t permit others’ lives and emotions to effect or rule their own.

#45) ComplainingComplaining implies two things – one, that we are victims, and two, that there are no solutions to our problems. Rarely does an emotionally intelligent person feel victimised, and even more infrequently do they feel that a solution is beyond their grasp. So instead of looking for someone or something to blame, they think constructively and dissolve the solution in private.



#46) NegativityEmotionally intelligent people have the ability to kerb cynical thoughts. They acknowledge that negative thoughts are just that – thoughts – and rely on facts to come to conclusions as well as being able to silence or zone out any negativity.

#47) Dwelling on the pastThose with high emotional intelligence choose to learn from the mistakes and choices they have made and instead of dwelling on the past are mindful to live in the now.

#48) SelfishnessWhilst a degree of selfishness is required to get ahead in life, too much can fracture relationships and cause disharmony. Try to avoid being overly selfish and consider others needs.

#49) Giving in to peer pressureJust because everyone else does something, they don’t feel compelled to follow suit if they don’t want to. They think independently, and never conform just to please other people.

#50) Being overly criticalNothing destroys a person’s morale faster than being overly critical. Remember that people are only human and have the same motivations (and limitations) as you. Take the time to understand another person then communicate the change you want to see.

By understanding and successfully applying emotional intelligence, you too can reach your full potential and achieve your goals.

The extent to which students view their intelligence as improvable (i.e., their “mindset”) influences students’ thoughts, behaviors, and ultimately their academic success. Thus, understanding the development of students’ mindsets is of great interest to education scholars working to understand and promote student success. Recent evidence suggests that students’ mindsets continue to develop and change during their first year of college. We built on this work by characterizing how mindsets change and identifying the factors that may be influencing this change among upper-level STEM students. We surveyed 875 students in an organic chemistry course at four points throughout the semester and interviewed a subset of students about their mindsets and academic experiences.

Latent growth modeling revealed that students tended to shift towards viewing intelligence as a stable trait (i.e., shifted towards a stronger fixed mindset and a weaker growth mindset). This trend was particularly strong for students who persistently struggled in the course. From qualitative analysis of students’ written survey responses and interview transcripts, we determined that students attribute their beliefs about intelligence to five factors: academic experiences, observing peers, deducing logically, taking societal cues, and formal learning.

Extensive prior research has focused on the influence of mindset on academic performance. Our results corroborate this relationship and further suggest that academic performance influences students’ mindsets. Thus, our results imply that mindset and academic performance constitute a positive feedback loop. Additionally, we identified factors that influence undergraduates’ mindset beliefs, which could be leveraged by researchers and practitioners to design more persuasive and effective mindset interventions to promote student success.

Students’ academic success is influenced not only by their cognitive abilities and content knowledge, but also by non-cognitive factors, such as their beliefs, attitudes, and values. One influential non-cognitive factor is students’ beliefs about the degree to which intelligence is a stable trait, termed “mindset” (Dweck, 1999). Students who believe that intelligence is a stable, unchangeable trait are described as holding a “fixed mindset” and are likely to interpret struggle or failure as an indication that they are not intellectually capable of succeeding (Dweck, 1999). Thus, students with a fixed mindset tend to avoid challenges, quit when they encounter challenge, and ultimately achieve less academic success (Dweck, 1999; Smiley, Buttitta, Chung, Dubon, & Chang, 2016). Conversely, students who believe that intelligence is a changeable trait that they can improve with effort and guidance are described as holding a “growth mindset.” These students are more likely to take on challenging tasks and persist through challenges by trying new strategies or increasing effort, ultimately achieving greater academic success (Dweck, 1999; Smiley et al., 2016).

Students’ mindsets are influential because they affect a variety of other non-cognitive factors, such as the types of goals students set (Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Hoyert & O’Dell, 2008), how students attribute their successes and struggles (Dweck, 1999; Smiley et al., 2016), and how they cope with challenges they encounter (Heine et al., 2001). Given the far-reaching influence of mindsets, it is important to understand how and why students’ mindsets develop and change over time.

Students’ mindsets themselves are malleable and appear to change over time. Researchers have investigated how they can encourage students to develop a growth mindset through conducting “mindset interventions,” which are brief activities or tasks that attempt to sway students toward a growth mindset. Successful mindset interventions have boosted students’ grades and persistence in STEM (Yeager et al., 2019; Yeager & Walton, 2011) and reduced or eliminated racial achievement gaps (Aronson, Fried, & Good, 2002). However, there has been considerable variability in the success of intervention attempts (e.g., Orosz, Péter-Szarka, Bőthe, Tóth-Király, & Berger, 2017). In fact, a recent meta-analysis of mindset interventions revealed that, among studies conducted with undergraduate students (13 independent samples; N = 7,871), there was no average effect of mindset interventions (d = 0.08, 95% CI = [− 0.02, 0.17], p = 0.123; Sisk, Burgoyne, Sun, Butler, & Macnamara, 2018).

The success of mindset interventions hinges on their ability to persuade participants to shift their mindsets. Yet, Sisk and colleagues’ meta-analysis (Sisk et al., 2018) revealed that nearly half (46%) of mindset interventions that measured mindsets before and after the intervention (i.e., manipulation check) failed to shift students’ mindsets. This implies that some mindset interventions may fail to produce measurable improvements because they were not effective in convincing students to adopt growth mindset beliefs. Mindset interventions could potentially be made more persuasive if their messaging was informed by data on how students form and change their beliefs about intelligence throughout their life. Thus, the goal of our study is to gain deeper insight into how and why undergraduate students’ mindsets change.

There is evidence that students’ mindsets change over time in the absence of an intervention (Kinlaw & Kurtz-Costes, 2003). A comprehensive review of studies investigating how children’s ideas about intelligence develop as they mature throughout primary and secondary school reported that this literature has yielded mixed results (Kinlaw & Kurtz-Costes, 2003). For example, Gunderson and colleagues (2017) conducted a cross-sectional study that found that students in middle school held stronger fixed mindsets about both math and reading/writing than both younger students in elementary school and older students in high school and college. Pomerantz and Saxon’s (2001) longitudinal study of students from fourth through sixth grade revealed that, as they aged, students increasingly viewed intelligence as a stable trait. Conversely, another longitudinal study of fifth- and sixth-grade students in Greece showed that growth beliefs about intelligence tended to get stronger over one year (Gonida, Kiosseoglou, & Leondari, 2006).

There has been comparatively less work on mindset development in undergraduate students. Two studies found no evidence of mindset change during college. Gunderson and colleagues' (2017) cross-sectional study found that first- and second-year undergraduate students’ mindsets about math and reading/writing did not differ from high school students'. Similarly, a longitudinal study of second- through fourth-year undergraduate students showed no change in mean fixed mindset scores on a domain-general measure of mindset (Robins & Pals, 2002). In contrast, a handful of recent studies have shown that undergraduate students do change their mindsets over their first year (Dai & Cromley, 2014; Flanigan, Peteranetz, Shell, & Soh, 2017; Scott & Ghinea, 2014; Shively & Ryan, 2013). A series of pre/post studies have shown that students tend to decrease in growth mindsets and increase in fixed mindsets throughout introductory undergraduate STEM courses, specifically in biology (Dai & Cromley, 2014), computer science (Flanigan et al., 2017; Scott & Ghinea, 2014), and math (Shively & Ryan, 2013). For example, Dai and Cromley (2014) measured the mindsets of 335 undergraduate students before and after year-long, two-course introductory biology series and found that students tended to report increased fixed mindset and decreased growth mindset. Considered together, existing research agrees that introductory STEM students tend to shift towards fixed mindsets, but the two studies that have included mid- and upper-level undergraduates have failed to find change in mindsets over time. Thus, more work is needed to understand the dynamics of undergraduate students’ mindsets past their first year of studies.

These studies suggest that students’ mindsets develop and change throughout their lives, including in college. However, little work has been done to examine the factors that influence mindset change. Dweck and colleagues have investigated factors that influence how young students form their mindsets (Dweck, 1999; Kamins & Dweck, 1999; Mueller & Dweck, 1998). Their work demonstrates that how educators and parents praise children communicates implicit messages about the nature of intelligence. Specifically, praising a students’ attributes (e.g., their intelligence) implies that success is the result of their innate traits and encourages a fixed mindset whereas praising students’ process (e.g., their effort) implies that success is the result of their behaviors and encourages a growth mindset (Dweck, 1999; Kamins & Dweck, 1999). Gonida and colleagues (2006) concluded that middle school students’ academic performance predicted their mindset beliefs. They conducted a year-long longitudinal study and tested a set of three alternative models to establish causality. They found that students who experienced greater academic success had stronger growth mindsets in the subsequent year. These results indicate that students’ academic experiences may influence their mindset beliefs. However, this study was conducted with Greek middle school students, and it remains unclear whether these results could generalize to students at different ages and in different cultural contexts.

Even less is known about the factors that influence mindsets of undergraduate students. Flanigan and colleagues (2017) examined how students’ academic motivation and engagement may influence the development of their mindset beliefs. They grouped first-year undergraduate students into “motivated self-regulated engagement profiles” based on a suite of motivational, self-regulation, affective, and strategic engagement variables. They found that students in different groups changed their mindsets to varying degrees throughout an introductory computer science course. For example, students in the “helpless” profile shifted towards a fixed mindset more strongly than students in other profiles (Flanigan et al., 2017). This study suggests that students’ motivational traits are one factor influencing their mindsets, but more work is needed to explain the mechanism of this effect and to identify any additional factors.

It is clear that students’ mindsets change over time and that undergraduate students’ mindsets are still changing in the absence of an intervention. However, many questions about mindset development remain open. We have a limited understanding of the dynamics of undergraduates’ mindsets after their first year because prior studies of undergraduate students’ mindsets have targeted introductory courses. Furthermore, these studies have yielded little insight into the factors that influence mindset change. Here, we begin to address these knowledge gaps guided by two research goals: (1) to characterize how undergraduates’ mindsets change in a mid-level, challenging STEM course and (2) to identify and describe factors that could be influencing undergraduate students’ mindsets.

We adopted an exploratory and descriptive approach because there has been minimal empirical work done on mindset change in mid-level undergraduate students. To investigate change in mindsets over time, we collected data longitudinally throughout the semester. We utilized a concurrent nested mixed-methods approach involving closed-response and constructed-response survey questions as well as interviews with a subset of participants because our two research goals needed to be addressed by different types of data (Warfa, 2016). Specifically, we relied primarily on quantitative data to characterize how students’ mindsets changed over time and primarily qualitative data to identify and characterize the factors that could be influencing students’ mindsets. We surveyed students about their mindsets four times throughout the semester in a challenging mid-level STEM course. We also surveyed students about their struggles in the course. We conducted latent growth modeling to investigate how mindsets changed over the semester and how students’ perceived experiences of academic failure or success were related to their mindsets. We also conducted conventional content analysis of constructed response survey questions and interviews to identify factors that could be influencing undergraduate students’ mindsets (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005). This data collection occurred as part of a larger exploratory study about undergraduate students’ mindsets and coping with academic challenge. This study was reviewed and determined to be exempt by the University of Georgia Institutional Review Board (STUDY00005634).

Our study participants were enrolled in a challenging mid-level STEM course (Organic Chemistry II) at a single large southeastern public university with very high research activity. We recruited participants from Organic Chemistry II because it is a required course for many professional schools and STEM majors. Further, because we were interested in exploring how students cope with struggle and the relationship between their academic performance and mindsets, we wanted to target a particularly challenging course, and Organic Chemistry has a national and local reputation for being a challenging STEM course.

Participants were compensated with a small amount of extra credit for completing the surveys. We surveyed students in the spring 2018 semester and repeated the quantitative data collection in the spring 2019 semester to increase the sample size. The course enrolled around 500 students each semester (510 in 2018, 500 in 2019), of which 875 students participated in the study by completing at least one survey (411 in 2018, 464 in 2019). The study sample consisted of mostly second-year students (63%), about half of whom were white (56%) and majoring in the life sciences (56%; Table 1). We used students’ constructed survey responses to select 20 participants to interview for this study from the 2018 cohort (see Additional file 1, Section 2 for further details about this selection process). We purposely selected participants who expressed diverse perspectives in their survey responses, who reported a mix of growth and fixed mindsets, and who were diverse in their personal characteristics (Table 1).


Each survey consisted of two versions of the mindset scale (Dweck, 1999), one focused on chemistry intelligence and the other on general intelligence, as well as additional closed-response and constructed-response questions (Survey Questions in Additional file 1, Section 1). Students were surveyed four times throughout the semester. Survey timing was coordinated in relationship to course milestones: the first survey occurred in the second week of class, the second survey just after the first exam scores were returned, the third survey around the course withdrawal deadline, and the last survey at the end of the semester between the end of classes and the final exam. The first three surveys were spaced approximately 2 weeks apart, but the fourth survey was administered approximately 4 weeks after the third survey. The uneven spacing between surveys is accounted for in the latent growth models by the specification of the loadings on the slope variable (see “Latent_Growth_Models.R” file for R code).

The mindset scale consists of eight items, which we tailored to the chemistry course context: four measuring a growth mindset (e.g., “No matter who you are, you can significantly change your chemistry intelligence level”) and four measuring a fixed mindset (e.g., “Your chemistry intelligence is something about you that you can’t change very much”) (Dweck, 1999). We chose to use “chemistry intelligence” because there is evidence that responses to the mindset scale are more accurate and predictive of academic outcomes when the questions are context-specific to the course being studied (Shively & Ryan, 2013). However, it is important to note that this approach may limit the extent to which these results can be generalized beyond the context of chemistry. Participants responded to these items using a 7-point scale of agreement (i.e., 1 = “strongly disagree”; 7 = “strongly agree”). Scores for growth mindset and fixed mindset were calculated by averaging participants’ responses to the four growth and fixed items, respectively. Average scores were only calculated if the participant responded to all four items. If they selected “prefer not to respond” to any of the items, the average score was not calculated and the data were considered missing.

We screened out participants who responded to the survey questions with insufficient effort (DeSimone, Harms, & DeSimone, 2015). Specifically, we included a directed-response item in each survey that read, “This is a control question. Please select [directed response, e.g., ‘disagree’] as your response to this item.” We discarded mindset scale responses from participants who did not select the directed response. Additionally, we discarded “long string” responses where participants selected the same extreme response for over half of the mindset scale (5 or more items out of 8 total). The items representing growth mindset and fixed mindset are interspersed throughout the scale, making it unlikely that participants would “agree,” “strongly agree,” “disagree,” or “strongly disagree” with five items in a row. We kept data from participants who selected a long string of “somewhat agree,” “neither agree nor disagree,” or “somewhat disagree” because participants could reasonably have no opinion or a weak opinion about these items. Relatively few responses were removed due to either the directed response questions or long string responses (fewer than 15 on any survey). Thus, insufficient effort screening is unlikely to substantially affect the analyses and conclusions of this study.

We calculated and modeled growth mindset and fixed mindset as separate constructs rather than reverse-coding growth items to create a single score. Previous studies have found that growth and fixed mindsets are separate constructs, although they are highly negatively related; it is inappropriate to combine responses on the scales as if they were a single construct (Cook, Castillo, Gas, & Artino, 2017). Confirmatory factor analyses of our data confirm that the two-factor structure is a better fit to the data than a one-factor structure (confirmatory factor analyses in Additional file 1, Section 4). For all analyses, we estimated separate models for growth and fixed mindsets because they were highly negatively correlated (r = − 0.73 in our data) and we encountered multicollinearity issues when they were included in the same models.

Extensive prior research suggests that mindsets should influence students’ academic success (Dweck, 1999; Yeager et al., 2019). To model the relationship between students’ mindsets and academic experiences, we asked students about their perceived level of success or failure in the course; we termed this variable “failure perception.” We chose to operationalize students’ academic performance with their perceptions of their performance rather than an objective measure of their actual performance (such as course grades) because students’ subjective perceptions of their academic performance should be more directly relevant to understanding their lived experiences than objective measures of their actual performance. For example, some students may see an average grade (e.g., “C”) as failing to meet their high standards whereas other students may see receiving a passing grade as a success.

We operationalized failure perception using two “Yes/No” questions on the fourth and final survey of each semester. First, students were asked, “Did you encounter struggle in Organic Chemistry II this semester?” Of the 659 students who answered these questions, only 88 students indicated that they did not struggle; these students were categorized as “never struggled.” Students who answered “Yes” were then asked, “Were you able to overcome struggle that you encountered?” The majority of students (462/659) indicated that they overcame the struggle they encountered by answering “Yes”; these students were categorized as “overcame struggle.” About 16% of students (109/659) indicated that they encountered a struggle that they did not overcome by answering “No”; these students were categorized as “continued struggle.”

To ensure that our interpretations of students’ responses to these questions accurately reflected students’ experiences, we presented our interpretation to students and asked them to comment on it in a constructed-response question. For example, students who answered “No” to the first question were then asked, “Your response suggests that you did not encounter struggle in organic chemistry II this semester. Please explain why this is or is not an accurate description of your experience.” Written responses to these questions were reviewed by two analysts who were in consensus that there were no discrepancies in our interpretation of students’ experiences with success or failure in the course.

On the first survey of the 2018 semester, a constructed-response question followed each version of the mindset scale that asked students to describe why they held these beliefs about intelligence. Similarly, on the second survey, a constructed-response question asked students to describe how their experience in organic chemistry II so far this semester has affected their responses to the mindset scale items. Students’ responses to these questions were analyzed using conventional content analysis to identify the factors that could be influencing undergraduate students’ mindsets (qualitative analysis described further below; survey questions in Additional file 1, Section 1).

We conducted interviews with a subset of participants to gain deeper insight into students’ relevant experiences. Constructed responses were used to select 20 students to interview. Interviews were semi-structured, meaning that we used an established outline of questions for every interview, but interviewers were free to vary the order of questions to follow the flow of conversation and to ask spontaneous follow-up questions based on participant responses (Fontana & Frey, 2000). During the interview, participants were asked about their beliefs about intelligence and experiences that shaped their beliefs about intelligence (interview guide in Additional file 1, Section 2). Participants were compensated with a $25 Amazon gift card for completing the interview, which lasted 45–60 min.

We analyzed students’ mindset scale responses over time in several steps. First, we tested for measurement invariance to ensure that scores from the mindset scale could be compared across time points. Next, we used multiple group comparisons to determine whether students’ personal characteristics influenced their mindset change throughout the semester. Then, we analyzed the change in growth and fixed mindsets over time and the relationship between mindset and students’ perceived academic performance using latent growth models. Finally, we estimated latent growth models using only complete cases to confirm that using full information maximum likelihood to handle missing data did not bias our results. All statistical analyses were conducted in the open-source statistical software R version 3.6.0 using the package “lavaan” (R Core Team, 2018; Rosseel, 2012). Code for all analyses is available in the supplemental materials.

To our knowledge, the mindset scale was not developed or tested for use in repeated measures as we have done here. Therefore, before conducting any analyses, we first tested for measurement invariance to confirm that the internal structure of the measure is consistent across time points. The results indicate that the factor structure remains consistent across time points, and thus, it is reasonable to compare growth and fixed mindset scores to each other across time points (measurement invariance in Additional file 1, Section 5).

We collected data on several variables that we hypothesized may influence change in mindset throughout the semester: gender identity, ethnic/racial identity, and generation in college (i.e., first generation or continuing generation). We conducted multiple group comparisons to determine whether distinguishing between these groups improved model data fit (multiple group comparisons in Additional file 1, Section 6). These analyses indicated that differentiating by racial/ethnic identity, gender identity, or generation status did not improve model fit. This indicates that these personal identities/characteristics did not significantly influence mindset change throughout the semester for students in our sample, so we did not include these variables in the latent growth models.

To characterize how students’ mindsets changed throughout the semester and the relationship between students’ perceptions of failure and mindset, we estimated a series of latent growth models. Latent growth models are a class of structural equation model that decompose the variance-covariance matrix resulting from repeated measurements into latent intercept and slope factors that quantify initial standing on the variable and change in that variable, respectively (Burant, 2016).

We constructed and compared three nested latent growth models (Preacher, Wichman, MacCallum, & Briggs, 2008). The first model, the “intercept-only model,” assumed that mindset scores did not change over time by excluding a slope variable. The second model, the “slope model,” included a linear slope latent variable, which allowed mindset scores to change over timeFootnote 1. If the slope model is a better fit to the data than the intercept-only model, that would indicate that mindset scores change throughout the semester (i.e., the amount of change is non-zero). The third model was the “full model,” and included “failure perception” as a regressor on mindset scores. If the full model better fit the data than the slope model, this would indicate that there is a relationship between students’ failure perception and students’ initial mindset and/or change in mindset over the semester.

Failure perception was included in the model as two dummy-coded variables with “continued struggle” as the reference group. We were only able to include data from participants who responded to the last survey, when questions measuring failure perception were administered. Thus, the 216 participants who did not answer the failure perception questions on the last survey were excluded from the latent growth models (model n = 659).

Following best practices, we evaluated model fit using multiple metrics (Hu & Bentler, 1999; Schermelleh-Engel, Moosbrugger, & Müller, 2003). We avoided placing too much weight on any one metric because each index has different biases and strengths (Hu & Bentler, 1999; Schermelleh-Engel et al., 2003). For example, some are more sensitive to sample size or complexity of the model, and some are used as an absolute measure of fit while others can only be used to compare nested models. Thus, we evaluated our models holistically based on information from multiple different model fit indices. See Additional file 1, Section 3 for a more detailed discussion of our interpretation of model fit indices and commonly used “rules of thumb.”

Of the 659 participants included in the latent growth models, only about 60% completed all four surveys (399 for growth mindset, 421 for fixed mindset). We used full information maximum likelihood (FIML) in the latent growth models to handle missing data. FIML is a common approach for fitting structural models with missing data, but requires that data are missing at random with respect to the outcome variable (Enders, 2010). For example, data missing due to attrition from the study that is related to the outcome of interest (in this case, mindset) would pose a problem. We believe that our data are missing at random because we only included data from students who responded to questions measuring failure perception, which were on the final survey of each semester. Thus, students who stopped participating in the study (e.g., due to withdrawing from the course) are not included in the analyses. In other words, attrition is not an issue in this dataset because only participants who responded to the last survey were included in the models. The only missing data were from intermediate time points, and there is no reason to believe that skipping intermediate surveys should be related to mindset.

To check that using FIML did not substantially impact our analyses and results, we also estimated all latent growth models with only complete cases (i.e., participants who responded to all four surveys). Using only complete cases did not change the results, the full model was still the best fit model for both growth and fixed mindset and the magnitudes and directions of all parameter estimates were virtually unchanged (complete case analyses in Additional file 1, Section 7). Therefore, we present results of latent growth models using FIML.

Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interview transcripts and responses to open-ended questions asking students to explain why they hold their mindset beliefs (survey 1) and how their mindset beliefs have changed this semester (survey 2) were analyzed qualitatively to identify sources of students’ mindsets using the software MAX-QDA 12 (VERBI Software, Berlin, Germany). We eliminated from our analysis survey responses that were off topic or failed to answer the question. In particular, many students responded by reiterating their belief without providing a reasoning or source of their belief. Of the 678 total survey responses, we analyzed 281 to identify reported sources of mindset beliefs.

Since there is no existing theory describing factors that influence undergraduate students’ mindsets, we adopted a conventional content analysis approach, which involves deriving coding categories directly from the text data, also referred to as “inductive coding” (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005). We created codes by identifying sections of text (e.g., sentences or paragraphs) in which participants described factors that affected their mindset beliefs and creating a label (i.e., “code”) that captures the idea. As new factors emerged, the codebook was iteratively refined. As necessary, codes were combined, split, or refined, and previous sections of text were revisited and re-coded with the new definitions.

Coding was conducted in an iterative process involving five of the authors as qualitative data analysts: one who had prior experience with content analysis (LL) and four undergraduate researchers with no prior experience (JC, HH, HM, and AB). Analysts conducted initial coding of a set of text (e.g., one interview or 50 survey responses) independently, then met to discuss to consensus and refine the codebook as necessary. When the codebook was modified or refined, previously coded sets were revisited and re-coded as necessary. Two analysts (LL and JC) read all content and were involved in all coding meetings in order to establish trustworthiness through increasing credibility and consistency (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Additionally, three other analysts (HH, HM, and AB) read, coded, and discussed partially overlapping subsets of the data to further establish aspects of trustworthiness (i.e., establish confirmability by increasing the diversity of perspectives in analysis) and accommodate analysts’ time constraints. The entire qualitative content analysis was completed before the final quantitative models were produced. Thus, coders’ interpretations of participants’ words were not influenced by knowing the results of the models. Interview participants’ quotes are presented using pseudonyms and survey respondents’ quotes are presented anonymously with light editing for grammar and spelling.

We addressed our two research goals with a combination of quantitative and qualitative results.

We used our quantitative results to address our first research goal, which was to characterize how undergraduates’ mindsets change in a mid-level, challenging STEM course. To determine whether undergraduate students’ mindsets changed over the semester, we compared the fit of the intercept-only model (which assumes that mindset scores do not change) to the slope model (which allows for change over time). The intercept-only models for both growth and fixed mindset fit the data poorly according to all fit statistics; that is, none of the fit statistics fell within a range typically considered acceptable. The slope models were a significantly better fit to the data than the intercept-only models, evidenced by the superior model fit statistics and statistically significant chi-square tests (growth Δχ2 = 113.97, fixed Δχ2 90.87; p’s < 0.001). However, the fit of the slope models was only marginally sufficient (Table 2).


We examined the slope model parameters to characterize the change in mindset throughout the semester. Students’ growth mindsets decreased slightly throughout the semester, as evidenced by the negative slope of the growth mindset model. Conversely, their fixed mindset increased slightly throughout the semester, evidenced by the positive slope in the fixed mindset model. Model parameters can be interpreted on a scale of 1–7, where 1 represents “strongly disagree,” 4 represents “neither agree nor disagree,” and 7 represents “strongly agree.” The slope for the growth mindset model suggests a weak decrease between each time point (β1 = − 0.07, standard error (se) = 0.01, p < 0.01) from the students’ starting point (β0 = 5.38, se = 0.04, p < 0.01). This implies an overall small decrease in agreement with growth mindset (− 0.28 points on a 7-point scale of agreement over the semester). Conversely, the slope variable in the fixed mindset model suggests a weak positive change between each time point (β1 = 0.08, se = 0.01, p < 0.01) from students’ starting point (β0 = 2.76, se = 0.05, p < 0.01). This implies an overall small increase in agreement with fixed mindset (0.32 points over the semester).

We used both our quantitative and qualitative results to address our second research goal to identify and describe factors that could be influencing undergraduate students’ mindsets. We used latent growth models to investigate whether and how students’ failure perceptions were related to their changes in mindset throughout the semester. We also qualitatively analyzed survey responses and interview transcripts, resulting in six themes related to sources of mindset: five factors that students reported as influencing their mindset beliefs (academic experiences, observing peers, deducing logically, taking societal cues, and formal learning) as well as uncertainty (counter-examples where students expressed uncertainty about what influenced their mindset beliefs).

Latent growth modeling indicated that students’ changes in mindsets related to their failure perceptions, evidenced by the superior fit of the full model, which included the failure perception variables, compared to the slope model, which did not include failure perceptions. For both growth and fixed mindsets, the full models were the best fit to the data according to all seven fit metrics and chi-square test results indicating that the full models were a significantly better fit than the slope models (Table 2). The full models are in the acceptable or good fit range for all model fit indices, except for the RMSEA. However, the RMSEA is biased for models with low degrees of freedom (Kenny, Kaniskan, & McCoach, 2015). The full models have only 9 degrees of freedom, which is indeed relatively low.

Students who experienced continued struggle started with different mindsets and followed a different trajectory throughout the semester than students who overcame struggle or never struggled (Fig. 1). Students who began the semester with more fixed and less growth mindsets reported continued struggle (Fig. 2). Students who experienced continued struggle started the semester somewhat agreeing with a growth mindset (β0 = 4.98, se = 0.10), which was significantly lower than students who overcame struggle (β0 = 5.44, p < 0.001) and students who never struggled (β0 = 5.6, p < 0.001). Conversely, students who experienced continued struggle started the semester somewhat disagreeing with a fixed mindset (β0 = 3.13, se = 0.11), which was significantly higher (i.e., more agreement) than students who overcame struggle (β0 = 2.71, p = 0.001) and students who never struggled (β0 = 2.54, p < 0.001).

Students’ failure perceptions were also related to their mindset change throughout the semester, with students who reported continued struggle experiencing the greatest shift away from a growth mindset and towards a fixed mindset (Figs. 1 and 2). Students who reported continued struggle decreased their growth mindset score by − 0.64 points throughout the semester (β1 = − 0.16, se = 0.03), which was a greater decrease than students who overcame struggle (− 0.20 total; β1 = − 0.05, p < 0.001) and students who never struggled (− 0.28 total; β1 = − 0.07, p = 0.016). Students who reported continued struggle also experienced the largest increase in their fixed mindset (0.80 total; β1 = 0.20, se = 0.03). This increase was greater than that experienced by students who overcame struggle (0.20 total; β1 = 0.05, p < 0.001) and students who never struggled (0.44 total; β1 = 0.11, p = 0.024).

The latent growth models provided evidence of a relationship between students’ academic experiences and mindsets. Qualitative analysis corroborated this relationship and further suggested that students’ academic experiences may influence their mindsets. Academic experiences were the most commonly discussed of the five factors: 15 of the 20 interview participants and 221 of 281 survey responses described how past academic experiences influenced their mindset beliefs. These responses revealed that students’ experiences with academic struggle were particularly influential. When students described struggling in their classes, their mindsets were influenced by whether they overcame their struggle and succeeded or continued to struggle and floundered. Students who reported continued struggle interpreted their struggles as evidence that they were unable to change their intelligence (i.e., fixed mindset). For example, Jade said:

I thought if you had the resources and you worked as hard as you could and you had the help that you needed, you could get to the point that you wanted to be, whether that be like an A or B. … But then, after O-chem [organic chemistry], I had those resources and I used them and I didn't do as well. So, I thought there might be a threshold to as far as resources could take you. And then at some point, it's really like whether you're genetically capable of connecting concepts or not.

Jade initially had a growth mindset, but she struggled in organic chemistry and failed to achieve her academic goals despite her best efforts. This experience led her to believe that she was not “genetically capable” of mastering organic chemistry, thus shifting her towards a fixed mindset.

In contrast, students who reported overcoming struggle interpreted their success as proof that they could improve their intelligence. For example, one student wrote:

Coming out of high school, I did not have a strong chemistry base. I struggled a bit when I took first semester general chemistry. However, in my second semester of chemistry I felt like I had a better grasp of learning the content and ended up getting an A in the class. So, I do believe it is possible to change your chemistry intelligence level.

Students also discussed how their academic experiences affected their mindsets, even if they did not struggle academically. Students who felt that they had learned as a result of their hard work took this as evidence that they had improved their intelligence. For example, one student wrote:

In O-Chem, I grew greatly in my knowledge of chemistry, as it challenged me to actually understand why certain principles applied and why certain things I learned were happening. I'd say that I would have not learned much of anything if I had not tried and applied myself, so I believe that everyone has the potential if they really care enough to try.

This student described learning a great deal about chemistry without facing any particular struggle. He reasoned that since he was able to learn by dedicating a lot of effort, other students like him should also be able to learn by working hard. Thus, students experiencing intellectual growth, sometimes by overcoming struggle, served as evidence to them that intelligence is improvable. Conversely, when students failed to achieve their goals, they took this as evidence that intelligence is a fixed trait. These results align well with the results from the latent growth models suggesting that students’ experiences with success or failure are related to changes in their mindsets.

Students reported changing their beliefs about the malleability of intelligence when they observed differences among their peers or watched their peers either fail or persevere in the face of struggle. Observing peers was the second most commonly discussed of the five factors: 11 of the 20 interviewees and 57 of 281 survey responses described being influenced by observing others. When they saw their peers fail despite trying their best, they concluded that this failure must be caused by insufficient intelligence. For example, one student wrote:

I have several friends who began in a science major and transferred to different majors after failing to be successful in gen chem [general chemistry] 1. One of these friends specifically barely passed gen chem 1, despite spending a significant amount of time studying. However, after switching to a business major she is succeeding tremendously, making 100 s on accounting tests. This goes to show that though anyone can learn at least a little more chemistry than they knew before, there are many people who simply cannot expand their chemistry knowledge to the depth that chemistry courses require.

This student learned a fixed mindset by observing her friend fail at chemistry and subsequently excel in another area, which she interpreted as evidence that peoples’ aptitude for different subjects is fixed. Conversely, students described how observing their peers overcome struggles was evidence that intelligence was malleable. For example, after responding to the mindset scale in a way that was consistent with a growth mindset, one student wrote:

The reason that I hold these beliefs is that my friend was awful at general chemistry and over the summer he changed his attitude on the subject and became more prepared by reviewing over general chemistry material and once the fall semester started, he came to class prepared, read the material, practiced the homework, and was attentive in class, and he came out of Organic Chemistry I with an A-

This student described observing her friend overcome failure and how, as a result, she came to believe it was possible for students like her to improve their intelligence.

Students were also influenced by observing differences in academic performance among their peers. They interpreted these differences as evidence of growth or fixed mindsets depending on the perceived causes and stability of the differences. Students perceived differences that were persistent and stable as evidence of the fixed nature of intelligence, as one student explained:

I have always noticed that people tend to have different levels of intelligence from birth. Although smart people typically work hard in school, I have noticed how other people have a much easier time picking up on things than others with a decent amount of consistency. … I have never seen anyone that I thought did not have much intelligence vastly improve how much intelligence they have.

This student observed and noted that differences among people were consistent throughout their lives. Notably, this student had not observed any peers improving their intelligence, which suggested to him that it was not possible to do so.

Students viewed the relationship between effort and performance as an indicator of fixed or growth mindset. When students perceived that effort was unrelated to differences in performance, they saw this as evidence of the fixed nature of intelligence. For example, Lydia compared herself to a classmate and said:

I think some students are naturally better at grasping chemistry concepts than others. I feel this way because I competed with a classmate last semester in [organic chemistry I]. [My classmate] always made 20-30 points higher than me on each test and "never studied." He didn't work through practice problems, didn't review his notes, and wouldn't memorize information. On the other hand, I would do all of this and more, studying 30 hours a week in preparation for an exam. This was really challenging for my self-esteem because I didn't understand why I wasn't being rewarded for my effort while [my classmate] was making A's without a sweat. My belief that some students are wired to understand certain concepts has mostly stemmed from experiences such as these.

Although Lydia did not fail, she was frustrated because she noticed a disconnect between effort and performance when she compared herself to her classmate. She thought that, if intelligence was malleable, then more effort should lead to better performance. However, her experience ran counter to her expectations and led her to conclude that she had a fixed level of intelligence that was lower than that of her classmate’s.

Conversely, other students observed their peers and concluded that there was a connection between effort and performance. One student wrote:

I was part of an advanced math and science program in high school and I noticed that the kids that were at the top of the program were the ones that paid attention the entire class while everyone else zoned in and out. … The most important of these [factors affecting performance] is how much an individual is willing to focus on a subject.

This student saw how effort led to success by watching peers who exerted more effort out-perform those who did not pay as much attention in class. He interpreted this difference as evidence that increased effort led to success, reflecting a growth mindset. These results suggest that students can learn their mindset beliefs from observing secondhand experiences of their peers, even if they themselves do not fail or overcome struggles.

Some students provided logical arguments as evidence of their growth mindsets. One interviewee and 31 of 281 survey responses used reasoning to support their mindset beliefs. We identified three arguments students used to support their mindsets: blank slate reasoning, reasoning about the nature of science, and reasoning about brain plasticity. Students who used these sorts of reasoning tended to hold a growth mindset; students in our sample who held a fixed mindset rarely provided logical arguments to support them.

Blank slate reasoning is the idea that people are born knowing nothing (“blank slates”) and that knowledge develops throughout their lives. Students reasoned that since they are born knowing nothing about chemistry, and increase their chemistry intelligence throughout their education, then their chemistry intelligence must be malleable. For example, one student wrote:

We can grow our knowledge and understanding, so intelligence must be changeable. At one point in time, we all knew nothing about chemistry. So then how could people become chemistry majors or professors if we couldn't change our chemistry knowledge and understanding?

This student reasoned that the existence of chemistry experts supports the growth mindset perspective, because they were not born as experts.

Other students reasoned about intelligence based on the nature of science. Since science is constantly changing and updating, students concluded that intelligence must be able to change as well. One student wrote:

I believe that the basis of science is discovery and learning more than you knew going into it. If no one can truly change the depth of their knowledge on any subject, then what is even the point of attending college and getting a degree? You go to class and learn because it increases your understanding of the topic.

According to this student, science as an enterprise is based on new discoveries and learning, implying that intelligence must also be changeable.

Finally, students also reasoned about the implications of brain plasticity. One student combined his knowledge of brain plasticity with his personal experience recovering from a concussion. He wrote:

I believe that intelligence is something that is malleable. Just as scientists are learning that the brain is actually able to heal itself like other body parts, influenced by proper lifestyle habits (eating, exercising, sleeping), I also believe it’s possible to change one's intelligence in the same way. So, I believe that although people are born with certain IQs, IQ can change throughout a person's lifetime. … I believe this because of my own experience with concussions. My brain was able to repair itself (to what extent, I will find out) after concussions. In the same way, I believe that by taking care of your brain, you can actually change its structure and performance … So, likewise, one can change his or her IQ.

This student used his knowledge of the brain’s capacity to change its physical structure to argue that it must be possible to increase one’s intelligence.

Nearly all students who used logic and reasoning to draw conclusions about the nature of intelligence endorsed a growth mindset. However, one student discussed brain plasticity and critical periods as evidence of a fixed mindset for adults. During her interview, Kayla said:

My thought process on it is that because of brain plasticity as a child, you grow up with this huge capability to learn. … Then you reach a certain age and it becomes more like you either can or you can't learn it. … By the time you get to a certain age, your brain cannot change that much from plasticity, you're not going to make more neural connections as you could as a child. That's why it's easier to learn languages and stuff [as a child]. So, I think a lot of it has to do with how you were raised and the type of learning you experience as a child that will make way for whether or not you can learn things in the future.

Kayla referenced the fact that young children learn languages more easily than adults as evidence for her view that adults’ intelligence is not changeable. Thus, Kayla has a fixed mindset about the intelligence of college-aged students since she believes that intelligence could only be changed by intervention in early childhood. These results suggest that what students learn about some topics indirectly related to intelligence (e.g., the nature of science and brain plasticity) can influence their mindset beliefs, and may ultimately impact their academic success.

A couple of students observed that the structure of their school system implied innate differences in intelligence levels (one interviewee and one survey respondent). Alice explained how young students are separated into classes based on their intelligence:

When you’re a kid, people learn to read really quick, or they don’t. People get math really easily, they get numbers and everything, or they don’t. I feel like you were separated based off your intelligence. … [My elementary and middle school classes] were all separated not based off your home room, they were based off of your level of intelligence, and it was pretty clear. … I was in the higher English group … you could see their books were longer, their books were shorter. And the math you were doing, you could completely tell in your homeworks with you and your friends when you were looking at it, like, you’re doing so much more work and you learn their math a lot earlier. So, I think I realized that there was definitely a difference in intelligence levels at a young age.

Alice observed as a child that she and her peers were sorted into classes based on intelligence and students at different intelligence levels were treated differently, with more intelligent students being assigned more difficult work. This cued her at a young age to believe that people have different innate levels of intelligence that are permanent throughout a student’s life.

Another student observed that IQ testing and standardized testing implied that students have a fixed level of intelligence that is measured through these tests: “IQ and similar testing standards currently in place lay out the idea that intelligence is an inherent trait that is simply something that one possesses.” While these sentiments were relatively uncommon, they revealed that students perceived the implicit messages in favor of a fixed mindset from educational practices such as sorting classes based on academic performance and intelligence testing.

Four students discussed learning about IQ and intelligence in their high school advanced placement psychology courses. Interestingly, these four students reported learning very different things about intelligence. For example, George said he was told that intelligence is a fixed trait:

[In] AP psych, and in high school, we did a bunch of intelligence and IQ stuff. And all those thoughts. And I remember it teaching like, “intelligence is like your innate- what you're capable of doing.”

Conversely, another student recalled being taught that intelligence is entirely malleable. He wrote,

“I was more-or-less explicitly told in my high school AP Psychology and FCID 3100 (Peer Learning Assistant Pedagogy Seminar) that intelligence is malleable and is the capacity to improve one's amount of learned knowledge and skills.”

The other two students remembered learning about intelligence in the context of a “nature vs. nurture” debate; these students held more mixed mindsets. For example, Lily spoke in detail about a report she wrote about “nature vs. nurture” and how it informed how she thought about intelligence:

When I wrote my paper on drug addiction and nature versus nurture, I think I kind of held the same stance that nature does play a very important role in it and how you're inclined to be addicted to things, but nurture, or your environment, is ultimately going to decide if you do. So yeah, I do think it [the malleability of intelligence] varies from person to person. I want to say genetics is more important, but then as soon as I say that, I think that it just varies.

Lily acknowledged the importance of both genetic and environmental aspects, but leaned towards thinking that innate, genetic influences are more important. The varied mindsets of these students highlight how the framing of content in psychology courses can lead students to adopt very different mindsets.

A handful of participants (seven of 281 survey responses) explained that they were not sure why they held their growth or fixed mindset beliefs. For example, one student wrote:

“I don't know exactly how these beliefs formed, there wasn't any specific event or lesson throughout my life that caused me to think this way, but this is just how I feel and think about the situation.”

These examples demonstrate that students are not necessarily aware of or able to articulate the factors that influence their mindset beliefs.

There are a number of limitations to consider when interpreting these data and drawing conclusions. First, this exploratory study was conducted in a single course at a single institution with relatively low diversity in terms of students’ personal characteristics, backgrounds, and experiences. Further, students volunteered to participate, which may lead to bias in the participant pool. We attempted to mitigate this bias by offering incentives for participating (i.e., extra credit for surveys) to maximize response rates. Thus, students in this sample represent a limited portion of the population of undergraduates in the USA (Table 1). These results could be strengthened by replication with a more representative sample of undergraduates.

Second, recent evidence suggests that the mindset scale does not function reliably when used with undergraduate students (Limeri et al., 2020). Ambiguity of the wording of the items (specifically, the term “intelligence”) may increase noise and effectively obscure underlying effects. Thus, if anything, this implies the estimates of effects from our models are underestimates. For example, we did not detect significant influences of race, gender, or generation in college on changes in mindset. In light of measurement problems with the mindset scale, these null results should not be interpreted as evidence that these factors do not influence mindset change. Additionally, we collected data using two versions of the mindset scale: one about “general intelligence” and one about “chemistry intelligence.” We elected to only analyze data from the “chemistry intelligence” measure because students’ responses to open-ended survey questions and interview comments suggested that they interpreted “general intelligence” in more varied ways than “chemistry intelligence.” This may limit the extent to which these conclusions can be generalized to domains beyond chemistry. We elected to use this measure for this study because, despite these limitations, it is currently the best available tool to measure mindset. The first and second authors are working on developing a new mindset measure to reliably measure the mindset of undergraduate students. Future research with an improved measure should be conducted to replicate these results.

Third, like many longitudinal studies, our study is limited by missing data. This issue is mitigated by the fact that participants had to respond to the final survey in order to be included in the model, eliminating effects of differential attrition. However, this limits the extent to which findings from this study can be generalized. That is, the quantitative results do not include students who dropped out from the study and it is unclear how well these results can generalize to the undergraduate chemistry student population. To address these concerns, we also conducted analyses with complete cases only, which yielded nearly identical results.

Finally, we presented five factors that students reported as influencing their mindset beliefs. However, drawing conclusions about causality from qualitative data is controversial (Maxwell, 2004). Our study design does not allow us to test causal influences. Additionally, students reported these factors retrospectively, and thus, these results are prone to recall bias as well as other cognitive biases. Therefore, readers should keep in mind that these are factors that students retrospectively reported as influencing their mindset beliefs. Further studies should be done to more directly test causality.

Here we examine how mid-level chemistry undergraduate students’ mindsets about chemistry change during a semester and explore the factors that influence the observed changes. We found that students tended to shift slightly towards a fixed mindset and away from a growth mindset and that the trajectory of their mindset change was related to their experiences with academic struggle. This corroborates and extends prior work demonstrating that introductory STEM students’ mindsets tend to shift towards fixed beliefs during their first year of college (e.g., Dai & Cromley, 2014; Flanigan et al., 2017). We also identified five factors that students described as shaping their mindsets: academic experiences, observing peers, deducing logically, taking societal cues, and formal learning. These results build on prior work, which has explored sources of mindsets focusing primarily on younger students (Dweck, 1999; Kamins & Dweck, 1999; Mueller & Dweck, 1998). These studies indicate that the nature of praise communication from adults influences children’s mindsets. Similarly, some of our participants spoke about their mindset beliefs being influenced by what they learned in their psychology classes, suggesting that how authority figures (e.g., parents and teachers) talk about intelligence is still influential. However, participants in our study primarily spoke about how their own experiences and observations affected their mindset beliefs (e.g., their own academic experiences, observing peers’ experiences). Thus, it is possible that the factors that influence students’ mindset beliefs shift over time, from predominantly messages from authority figures to reliance on personal experiences and observations. Altogether, our results indicate that mindset should not be considered a stable trait in undergraduate students, but rather a dynamic trait that is influenced by students’ current and prior experiences in their studies and other contextual factors.

Our results suggesting that students’ mindsets were influenced by their academic experiences have implications for mindset theory. Extensive prior research has documented that students’ mindsets influence their academic performance (e.g., Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Yeager et al., 2019). However, the possibility that students’ performance also influences their mindsets has rarely been considered. One study found evidence for this effect in Greek middle school students (Gonida et al., 2006), but we are unaware of any prior evidence of this relationship in undergraduate students. Our longitudinal data provide evidence of a positive feedback loop: mindsets influence students’ perceptions of their academic performance and students reported that their academic performance influences their mindsets (Fig. 3). Although we measured students’ perceptions of their academic performance and not their actual performance, our data corroborate extensive prior research that mindsets influence students’ academic performance. Students who began the semester with a lower growth mindset and a higher fixed mindset were more likely to report experiencing continued struggle throughout the semester.


Mindset beliefs and academic performance each influence each other and thus constitute a positive feedback loop. There is evidence in the literature and from the results reported here for both parts of this feedback loop

Our results also provide novel evidence that students’ academic experiences affected the trajectory of their mindset change throughout the semester. This relationship was supported by both our quantitative data (i.e., the significant effect of failure perception on the slope) and qualitative data (i.e., students’ interviews and written survey responses). The fit of our latent growth models indicated that students who experienced continued struggle had the strongest shifts away from a growth mindset and towards a fixed mindset. Students who experienced some degree of success in the course, either by never encountering struggle or overcoming struggle, experienced smaller shifts in their mindsets. It is not possible to infer causality from the latent growth models alone because change in mindset and academic experiences occurred simultaneously throughout the semester. Our qualitative results corroborated this relationship and further suggested that, at least from the students’ perspective, past academic experiences may influence students’ mindset beliefs (Maxwell, 2004). Students in our sample who overcame struggle described their experience as evidence that their intelligence improved and thus shifted toward a growth mindset. Conversely, students who continued to struggle described their experience as evidence that they were not capable of improving their intelligence, and thus shifted toward a fixed mindset. Collectively, these results suggest that mindset and performance could reciprocally affect each other. This implies that undergraduate students’ early experiences with struggle may have the potential to shape their mindset beliefs, which in turn influence their future academic performance. However, while the data presented here suggest that students’ academic experiences affect their mindset beliefs, we are unable to definitely test causality with this study design. Rather, we pose the recursive model (Fig. 3) as a hypothesis that should be tested in future studies.

These results have implications for the design of and research on mindset interventions. There is evidence that nearly half of mindset interventions reported in the literature are insufficiently persuasive and thus fail to produce positive student outcomes (Sisk et al., 2018). The five factors we identified that students reported as influencing their mindsets could potentially inform the design of mindset interventions. The first factor is their prior academic experiences with struggle, failure, and success. Mindset interventions may influence students by asking them to reflect on past times when they have learned or overcome a struggle, reminding them that they are capable of doing so. In this way, interventions may tap into and capitalize on the positive feedback loop between mindset beliefs and academic performance. Additionally, this finding could inform the timing of mindset interventions, which is an important element of designing effective interventions (Yeager & Walton, 2011). If academic experiences trigger a positive feedback loop between academic experiences and mindset beliefs, then intervening at an early stage may be critical to achieving positive student outcomes. Helping students overcome early struggles may help them adopt a stronger growth mindset, making it more likely they will continue to overcome future struggles and further affirm their growth mindset.

The second factor we identified is observing their peers deal with struggle or noting differences among their peers. Students described being influenced by seeing their friends or other students overcome struggles and recognizing that it was possible for themselves as well. Mindset interventions could capitalize on this social element by having students or near-peers share stories about how they have overcome academic struggles by dedicating more effort, seeking help, or changing their study strategy. This may inspire students to believe that they are also capable of overcoming their own struggles. Additionally, students interpreted differences among their peers as evidence of a growth or a fixed mindset, depending on whether they viewed these differences as stable or related to effort. Thus, another possible design for mindset interventions would be to influence how students interpret the differences they observe among their peers, encouraging them to view differences as related to effort or study strategy rather than innate differences in intelligence.

The third factor influencing students’ mindsets is reasoning from scientific principles. Mindset interventions may be more influential if they integrate the ever-evolving nature of science and information about brain plasticity in adulthood. Some mindset interventions already convey their message by teaching students about brain plasticity (e.g., Yeager & Dweck, 2012). However, these interventions are typically targeted at younger students. It may be necessary to craft these messages to an older student audience who may have a more sophisticated knowledge of brain plasticity. For example, in our study, one student cited the lower plasticity of adults’ brains compared to children’s as evidence for a fixed mindset. Thus, it may be necessary to identify and address specific ideas that undergraduates have about brain plasticity in mindset interventions targeted at the undergraduate level. It may be fruitful to test interventions that teach about the neurobiology of learning, emphasizing the physical changes that take place in the brain (Owens & Tanner, 2017).

The last two factors influencing students’ mindsets are ideas about intelligence communicated by societal cues (e.g., IQ testing implies a fixed intelligence) and psychology courses (e.g., intelligence is entirely genetically controlled). These results indicate that what students learn about intelligence in their psychology courses may have important implications for how they view themselves and their academic performance. Intelligence is a common topic in psychology courses, yet a recent study analyzed the content of 29 of the most popular introductory psychology textbooks and discovered that 79% of them contained inaccurate statements or logical fallacies about intelligence (Warne, Astle, & Hill, 2018). Thus, mindset interventions may be more convincing if they directly address some common misconceptions about intelligence and IQ.

Future research should evaluate whether these suggested modifications could improve the persuasiveness and effectiveness of mindset interventions. This assessment could involve “manipulation checks” where students’ mindsets are measured before and after the intervention to ensure that the intervention actually shifted students towards a growth mindset. These brief checks could be used to compare different intervention designs and reveal critical intervention elements.

We found that students tend to shift towards a stronger fixed mindset and a weaker growth mindset during a challenging, upper-level STEM course and that this trend is particularly strong for students who struggle in the course. We identified five factors that influence undergraduates’ mindsets: academic experiences, observing peers, deducing logically, taking societal cues, and formal learning. Prior research has focused on mindset’s influence on academic performance. Our results support this effect and further suggest that academic performance influences students’ mindsets, constituting a positive feedback loop. The factors influencing mindset we identified could be leveraged by researchers and practitioners to design and evaluate more persuasive mindset interventions.

The quantitative data generated and analyzed during this study are included in this published article and its supplementary information files. The qualitative data (i.e., constructed survey responses and interview transcripts) are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

Models with non-linear slopes were tested, but were inadmissible, and descriptive and graphical analysis did not present strong evidence for non-linear change. Thus, our data support a linear slope variable.

Student mindsets: fixed vs growth

27.11.2018 â¢ 3 minutes

A studentâs mindset tells you how they deal with failure and success in a learning environment, and reflects the image they have of their own learning potential. As such, it greatly influences their motivation and the learning habits they will develop in the future.

Stanford University psychologist Carol Dweck discerns two main types of student mindset: growth and fixed. Students with a fixed mindset believe that peopleâs intelligence and abilities are constant, while those with a growth mindset know that these can be changed and improved. When facing a challenge, one will take the struggle as a sign of their limited capabilities, the other as a learning opportunity.

    Top 5 Characteristics of a Growth Mindset
    
    
    
      – Mental Health Center Kids
    
  

Key Takeaways:

There is plenty of talk about developing a growth mindset, but what do the characteristics of a growth mindset actually look like? There are some qualities that define both growth and fixed mindsets. Knowing the difference between the two can help you develop a state of mind that is flexible and resilient rather than stagnant or declining. Here, we’ll talk about the 5 characteristics of a growth mindset so that you know whether you’re on the right track.

A growth mindset is a frame of mind that believes that abilities, intelligence, talents, and other such attributes can be developed through learning and effort. A growth mindset also emphasizes that challenges and failures are part of the learning process, to which we can adapt and thrive as a result.

A growth mindset allows for learning, motivation, performance, and resilience. People with a growth mindset are more likely to exert more effort, embrace change and challenges, and use feedback as an opportunity to learn.



So how can we know if we have a growth mindset? While the answer might seem obvious, it isn’t always clear-cut. There is no such thing as having a pure growth mindset because we adopt different mindsets depending on the circumstances we are in. For instance, you may take more risks when it comes to your work, but you might also value your daily routine and be more averse to change in that aspect of your life. Though the difference between the two mindsets may not be as definitive, there are some characteristics of a growth mindset that may suggest whether you lean towards this type of thinking or the other.

Here are 5 top growth mindset characteristics:

People who want to be successful must learn to embrace flaws and mistakes. Those who have a growth mindset see these setbacks as opportunities to learn and improve. They analyze what led to the mistake and look forward. People with fixed mindsets tend to view flaws and mistakes as obstacles that they cannot move past. Only people who have growth mindsets can accept their errors and continue learning.

A fixed mindset is ashamed of failure and unmotivated to achieve set goals. The fear of starting all over again has relegated some people to downfall. Because you failed once or twice didn’t mean you cannot be successful. Someone with a growth mindset is not afraid to start the process all over again. He is not bothered by the stress. He knows rest hasn’t come until he achieves success.

There is hardly such a thing as an overnight success, and the same is true for developing intelligence. We are all on a journey to reach our goals and dreams, and to achieve them, we must achieve mastery through effort. People that have a fixed mindset will not believe that you can become more intelligent over time with the right strategies and effort. Those with a growth mindset understand that the more practice and work people put in, the more likely they are to develop their intelligence.

Challenges are part of what we are made of. They support and test our growth. Individuals that have a growth mindset welcome challenges and see them as chances to prove their abilities. People who avoid difficulties may not reach the goals and successes they want. According to a well-known saying, "What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger." The purpose of challenges is to measure our progress, not to scare us.

Another one of the growth mindset traits that people may find useful in their development is being open to feedback. A person with a fixed mindset perceives the achievement of others as posing a danger to their own success. However, feedback on our efforts should be recognized as constructive criticism. A growth-oriented person is more receptive to such valuable feedback. Positive feedback helps us focus on our shortcomings and how we can further improve. An individual with a fixed mindset will likely not listen and simply accept things as they are. No matter how perfect you think your work may be, it is always important to consider other people's perspectives.

Knowing these growth mindset qualities can help us grow from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset. Having a growth mindset is a continuous process that can be developed. The goal is to identify where and when we adopt a fixed mindset and how we can improve ourselves, where applicable. By using tools such as growth mindset posters and asking the right questions, we can definitely become more flexible, resilient, and motivated to deal with difficulties that life throws at us.

When a student enters a classroom, looks at an assignment, and instantly says, “I can’t do this,” they’re exhibiting what’s known as a fixed mindset. When a student is in this state, there’s little a teacher can do to motivate them. So what is the solution? Switching from this fixed mindset to a growth mindset can be the key to encouraging students to be open and willing to take on new challenges and helping them understand the impact their attitude has on their ability to achieve. Here’s a closer look at what a growth mindset is and how you can encourage your students to embrace it in your classroom.

 



What does it mean to have a growth mindset? Growth mindset can be defined as believing that people’s basic qualities and abilities can be improved and increased through dedication and hard work. This belief indicates that brains and talent are just part of the picture of success. Someone with a growth mindset believes if they work hard, they can attain what they want to, even if their natural talents are not the same as someone else’s.

 

A person with a growth mindset also believes intelligence and basic abilities can change over time with the right effort. These are not fixed entities, but they can grow. In education, this mindset encourages students to value the effort they put into their education and the skills they gain rather than focusing only on the output or success.

 

A growth mindset for students involves four key components. These are:

 

Someone with a growth mindset isn’t afraid of challenges. Instead, they view them as an opportunity and with hard work they can grow their skills and abilities.

 

This embrace of challenges allows someone with a growth mindset to push through obstacles or setbacks. In a school setting, students are empowered to keep working even when they don’t fully grasp a concept or understand the task at first.

 

A student with a growth mindset sees the value in the effort as well as the outcome. The skills gained when trying are just as important as achieving a particular goal.

 

Finally, a growth mindset teaches someone to embrace and learn from criticism. When someone else is successful, a person with a growth mindset does not view others’ successes as negative things but rather as a place to find inspiration.

 

A growth mindset is in stark contrast to a fixed mindset. In a fixed mindset, the person believes intelligence and talent are part of who they are and do not change or grow over time. These are fixed traits, so they don’t spend time developing them. For example, a student who is not reading on grade level will decide that means they are a “bad reader” and shy away from reading.

 

In contrast, someone with a growth mindset believes their talent and intelligence can grow. This inspires them to keep working, even if they aren’t successful at first. This makes the learning experience more positive, even for students who may struggle, because the goal becomes progress and growth, not a particular success metric. Since the growth mindset says everyone has the capacity to develop their basic abilities through hard work, students feel inspired to put in the effort, and effort will create more learning.

 

In the education setting, a growth mindset changes a student’s attitude toward learning. The student begins to believe they are capable of learning and developing their basic abilities, and this causes them to work harder.

 

Hard work leads to increased productivity in the classroom, regardless of the age of the student. When students embrace a growth mindset, their harder work and positive attitude lead to better academic performance. The focus changes from reaching a particular score or grade to making progress instead, and progress will lead to academic achievement. Teachers spend their time encouraging students and modeling learning processes, and an overall positive mindset keeps them moving forward and pushing past their comfort zones.

 

Embracing a growth mindset in your classroom benefits your students in several ways. You may notice the following gains:

 

Kids with a growth mindset want to learn from others. This naturally sparks better communication skills because the best way to learn from others is to communicate. In addition, students have more positive peer-to-peer interactions as they seek to help the entire class grow their talents.

 

In a growth mindset, failure is viewed as a chance to learn and develop talents. It’s something to be embraced, not feared. This attitude makes students more resilient when they face failure in their academic pursuits.

 

Open-mindedness is the willingness to consider new information or ideas. It becomes a natural offshoot of having a growth mindset. Since the goal with a growth mindset is to grow talents and intelligence, students will want to learn ideas that work for others to see if they will work for themselves.

 

Students with a growth mindset perform drastically better than those with a fixed mindset, according to research. In fact, it can be more impactful than other important factors, such as socioeconomic background, when predicting academic success. When students believe they can achieve better, they keep working at their academics, and they then more easily meet their goals.

 

Creativity is praised and rewarded in a classroom that has a growth mindset. Teachers and students alike realize that creative thinking is a great way to grow intelligence. Students are taught that brains are like muscles, and the more creative thinking we utilize, the stronger that muscle will grow. This emphasis helps develop creative thinkers.

 

Teachers are not the adversaries in a classroom with a growth mindset. They are the encouragers who help students push harder to grow their abilities. Peers are not the competition. They are the people that students learn from and grow alongside. 

 

 

Reading is often an area that students feel they can’t excel at, especially as they get to higher grades in elementary school, middle school, and high school. Yet adjusting students’ mindsets can change this.

 

When students embrace the philosophy behind a growth mindset, they see reading improvement, specifically in reading comprehension. In other words, when they believe they can increase their intelligence through effort, students are able to gain the skills they need to read and understand text and remember what they have read.

 

So what can teachers do to encourage a growth mindset in their classrooms and see these types of gains? Here are some strategies to incorporate into your classroom.

 

You must model a growth mindset for your students. If you make a mistake, tell your students why you are happy you made it. Is there an area you struggle with, like math or spelling? Share this with your students and explain how you overcame roadblocks. When you face an obstacle, talk through your solutions to overcome that obstacle with them.

 

When students make mistakes and can view those mistakes as a part of the learning journey, they celebrate imperfection! If this is part of your classroom culture, students won’t feel embarrassed, but will learn to celebrate imperfection as a way to grow. After all, there’s a reason Bob Ross referred to mistakes as “happy accidents.”

 

Students need a model to evaluate and reflect on their work, both on their successes and on their failures. Craft lesson plans that give students an opportunity to reflect on constructive feedback from you and from their peers. Provide opportunities and model ways to self-evaluate and praise students when they can reflect on their efforts. Encourage curiosity not just about the world around them, but also about their own learning styles and talents.

 

A fixed mindset says, “I can’t read this book.” A growth mindset says, “I can’t read this book yet, but I will be able to.” This small word makes a big difference in a child’s internal dialogue, so model using it and teach students to use it. Think of changing these words as a mindset intervention that will help your students as they are developing a growth mindset.

 

A growth mindset teaches students to ask for help and work with others to create a positive outcome. Foster this by developing cooperative exercises that encourage students to work together to solve the problems they face. Cooperative learning also takes an emphasis off of individual outcomes—which makes students compete against each other—and places the focus on helping each other develop their individual abilities while working together.

 

Overcoming obstacles is an essential part of the growth mindset, but in order to do this, students must face obstacles. Don’t shy away from giving students complex problems or assignments to solve, and give them opportunities to grow their abilities and work on problem-solving.

 

Finally, consider adding a tool like Beanstack to your classroom to encourage a growth mindset. Beanstack encourages students to keep going by rewarding minutes spent reading, regardless of the number of pages read in that time. This allows all students to achieve and rewards them for their effort, which is in line with the growth mindset.

 

Reading abilities and a growth mindset are directly connected; one study found that students who have lower reading comprehension achievement at the end of fourth grade also tend to have a fixed mindset. Not only does having a growth mindset help improve reading abilities, but more reading encourages the development of skills, which further supports the growth mindset. The two work hand in hand. 

 

Beanstack uses unique gamification features that strengthen kids’ intrinsic motivation to read and improve their reading skills over time. Students build healthy reading habits as they keep working to achieve rewards like digital badges and reading streaks. Teachers and school librarians can boost positive motivation with reading challenges that offer students prizes and rewards for meeting and exceeding goals. Beanstack’s robust reporting features help identify when students meet a benchmark and help target interventions for students who may be falling behind. As part of a classroom or school that’s embracing a growth mindset, Beanstack can be a valuable tool.

# Growth Mindset | Teaching + Learning Lab

Mindsets are the implicit theories that individuals hold about the malleability of human characteristics. Research indicates that students’ beliefs about the nature of intelligence and ability significantly shape their response to academic challenges (Dweck, 2006; Yeager & Dweck, 2012). 

The mindset framework summarizes research on how people think, feel, and respond to failure and challenging experiences. Individuals who believe that intelligence and ability are largely immutable (‘fixed mindset’) respond to failure by withdrawing, disengaging, or persisting with the same set of strategies despite their prior demonstrated ineffectiveness.

On the other hand, students who believe they can substantially increase their intelligence and ability through experience and effort (‘growth mindset’) often react to academic challenges by allocating more effort, experimenting with new approaches, and seeking feedback. Students with a growth mindset set mastery goals and increasingly challenging tasks that promote skill development and acquisition.

Students with a fixed mindset, by contrast, tend to select performance goals, safer learning experiences that help them validate their intelligence, and avoid exposing deficiencies to others, as shown in the table below. 

Mindsets occur in a continuum between the fixed and growth extremes and are domain-specific. For example, a student can have a growth mindset towards developing coding skills while demonstrating fixed mindset beliefs towards public speaking. Even within a certain domain, an individual might initially approach a particular challenge by exerting effort and seeking help—demonstrating a growth mindset, but may subsequently perceive setbacks as a diagnosis of low inherent ability—demonstrating a fixed mindset.

Although students with fixed mindsets can succeed academically when their studies are going well, a fixed-mindset approach can hinder individuals when confronted with serious setbacks. Fixed-mindset thinking can result in students:

Beyond helping students to overcome the negative outcomes listed above, teaching students that intelligence/abilities are malleable has been shown to bridge the academic gap for women and underrepresented minorities (Aronson, Fried, & Good, 2002; Good, Aronson, & Inzlicht, 2003) and to increase their sense of belonging (Good, Rattan, & Dweck, 2012).

The mindset communicated by an instructor’s teaching practices can influence students’ behavior regardless of the students’ original mindset (Park, Gunderson, Tsukayama, Levine, & Beilock, 2016; Rattan, Good, & Dweck, 2012). Therefore, as an instructor, it is important that you model a growth mindset in the classroom.

Use personal examples and examples from others. Interventions that exposed students to narratives of eminent physicists modeling how they themselves overcame failures and struggles improved physics learning (recall of facts and problem solving) and increased their interest in physics (H. Y. Hong & Lin-Siegler, 2012; Lin-Siegler et al., 2016). 

Emphasize the importance of failure and iteration in the engineering design process and research. Although the connection between mindset and the research/engineering process has not been rigorously evaluated, explicitly destigmatizing failure in this way may help students adopt a growth mindset orientation and help them embrace educational challenges and risks.

Although we do not have data on how many students at MIT exhibit a fixed-mindset orientation, students may arrive at MIT with a history of success that has been accompanied by “intelligence praise” from parents, teachers, and mentors. Studies that probe the origin of mindset inclinations show that when children are given lots of praise for their intelligence—as opposed to receiving praise for using strategies and allocating effort (i.e., “process praise”)—they are more likely to adopt a fixed-mindset orientation (Gunderson et al., 2013; Mueller & Dweck, 1998). If a student is operating primarily with a fixed mindset relating to academics, they may encounter academic struggle for the first time at MIT.

In a recent online intervention (Study 3 in Yeager et al., 2016b), students from a highly selective private university were taught that critical feedback from professors and other instructors reflected “high standards and confidence that students can meet those standards, not a negative judgment of the student or his/her potential” (Yeager et al., 2016b). Past research has demonstrated that clarifying the intent of critical feedback can increase students’ motivation to revise or improve their work, particularly for students who are more at risk of stereotype threat (Cohen, Steele, & Ross, 1999). 

Students who are taught to reframe their interpretations of why a task might be difficult (ex: learning something new can be difficult) improve their performance during demanding tasks (Wilson, Damiani, & Shelton, 2002). 

You can help students reframe their interpretations of learning difficulty by using personal examples of times when they struggled to learn something and had to exert effort to learn. Explain to students how learning takes place and that it is normal and expected to have difficulty learning something new.

Emphasize that learning should feel challenging. Behaviors that make studying feel less effortful may not be desirable for learning (E. L. Bjork & Bjork, 2011). For example, testing yourself by doing a new set of problems, rather than reviewing previously solved problems might feel more effortful and difficult, but leads to better performance & deeper learning.

Mindset interventions demonstrate that teaching students about neuroplasticity has the potential to change their beliefs about the nature of intelligence and ability. 

Explain to students how expertise develops. Expertise is achieved by zeroing in on weaknesses and tackling those aggressively—a form of practice called “deliberate practice.” Deliberate practice requires focused attention to deficiencies and constant feedback. The goal of deliberate practice is not to just meet someone’s potential but to build it by continuing to move beyond someone’s current ability level (zone of proximal development) (Ericsson & Pool, 2016). 

By communicating the process for increasing competence for a particular skill and by providing examples and strategies to demonstrate skill development within a domain, you can help students understand that 1) abilities and intelligence are not fixed and 2) that struggling and making mistakes are part of the natural process of learning, as they seek experiences that stretch their comfort zones. 

Provide assignments and exams where students can show progress over time, such as projects or papers that incorporate cycles of feedback and revision, so that students have the opportunity to improve their work with each iteration and allowing test corrections. 

Reflection question: Was there anything that you found particularly motivating about how Professor Devadas presented this to the class?

Reflection question: What activities does Professor Roland describe that help students develop their public speaking skills?

Reflection question: What structures and class activities were used to normalize failure and highlight it as an essential component of the design process?

Mindset interventions may be ineffective if students are mostly operating in fixed-mindset environments.

From the literature on mindset, we understand that student behaviors may be more tightly correlated with the instructor’s mindset than students’ own mindsets (Park et al., 2016; Rattan et al., 2012). Therefore, it is not enough for faculty and instructors to express a desire to have a growth mindset—their classroom practices and behaviors must also support the development of a growth mindset. 

Programs and processes that emphasize grades too much (ex: entrance into medical school) or cultures in which extreme time constraints are the norm (ex: the culture of course and extracurricular overload common at MIT) can contribute to adoption of performance goals rather than mastery goals. 

The long-term effects of scalable interventions are unknown. The most scalable interventions on mindset (i.e., those delivered online) are brief and their effects have only been assessed for a short period of time—from a single semester to approximately one year. We do not know if the effects of these brief interventions can persist over long periods of time, such as for a student’s 4 undergraduate years and beyond (Orosz, Péter-Szarka, Bőthe, Tóth-Király, & Berger, 2017)

An overemphasis on teaching about mindsets can backfire. 

Be sure you are not focusing on mindset at the expense of teaching students specific strategies to improve performance and learn from feedback. The adoption of a growth mindset is helpful—but not sufficient— in overcoming academic challenges. 

It is also critical to be conscious of the changing inequities in our society that make it more difficult for certain students to succeed.

Well-designed curricula, high-quality instruction, and nurturing learning environments where all feel welcomed are also essential to ensure your students are maximizing their potential. 

MIT and various peer institutions have launched initiatives to collect and share experiences from faculty and students that can help normalize struggle and failure, such as:

# How to Foster a Growth Mindset in the Classroom | American University

Of the many challenges educators face, one of the most formidable—and least obvious—is student mindset. Teaching students to comprehend, absorb, and apply new material and concepts is challenging under any circumstances. The undertaking is much greater, however, when students doubt their ability to learn.

Can simply believing you have the ability to learn increase your ability to learn? According to growth mindset researchers, the answer is yes.

A more detailed look at mindset theory, as well as some of the ways that teachers can foster growth mindset in the classroom, illustrates mindset development’s importance in education.

One theory of intelligence holds that people can be categorized according to their implicit beliefs about ability. People with a fixed mindset believe that abilities are innate, while people with a growth mindset believe that they can acquire abilities through effort and study.

Carol Dweck, a psychologist, developed the fixed versus growth mindset theory. The Stanford University professor’s pioneering research, as well as her 2006 book, Mindset:The New Psychology of Success, popularized the concept of fixed and growth mindsets.

To gain a better understanding of what growth mindset is, compare the differences between fixed and growth mindset outlooks and behaviors.

Fixed and growth mindsets profoundly affect the way that individuals respond to failure. People with a fixed mindset view failure as a result of their lack of ability, while people with a growth mindset see the opportunity to expand their abilities and to work harder and smarter.

The fixed mindset vs. growth mindset dichotomy can also be expressed in terms of goals. People with a fixed mindset wish to appear intelligent because they believe that failing to do so reveals a weakness. People with a growth mindset are much less apprehensive about how their intelligence is perceived because they believe that knowledge and ability can be improved through effort. These outlooks produce almost diametric goals related to learning: a person with a fixed mindset wants to avoid appearing unintelligent; a person with a growth mindset wants to overcome challenges.

While the basic concept of fixed mindset vs. growth mindset is simple, mindset designations are much more nuanced in reality. An important factor of the mindsets is that they can be different in different domains. For example, a person may have a growth mindset in athletic or artistic endeavors but have a fixed mindset in academic endeavors.

Furthermore, mindsets aren’t absolute, immovable states. The fixed or growth mindset exists on a spectrum, and even those positions can vary. A person may have a predominant growth mindset in one area—math, for example—but an especially challenging problem may trigger a response that’s more consistent with a fixed mindset.

Dweck has described the growth mindset theory as a response to the self-esteem movement, which held that lavishing students with praise builds confidence that leads to improved achievement.

Mindset researchers propose a different approach. Instead of giving students general praise or praising outcomes—an ineffective practice in Dweck’s view—teachers should focus on praising students’ efforts and the steps they take to overcome challenges and make progress. By doing so they reinforce the simple but powerful idea that ability can be improved.

Dweck’s early research demonstrated multiple potential benefits to encouraging a growth mindset in education. One of her studies showed that praising students’ efforts rather than their intelligence made them more likely to pursue more difficult challenges. Another study demonstrated the influence of simple mindset interventions. Her research showed that students who were taught about developing intelligence went on to perform better in school and exhibit more motivation in the classroom.

Growth mindset has been widely embraced inside and outside of education. (Growth mindset has become a popular topic in the business world, for example.) However, the concept isn’t without its critics. Skeptics point out that few researchers have been able to replicate Dweck’s results, and much of the corroborating research that’s been done has been done by Dweck and her colleagues. Still, mindset research continues to advance, and evidence of the benefits of a growth mindset in education continues to mount.

Learning how to foster a growth mindset in students requires time and practice. The approach requires consistent instruction that reinforces and demonstrates the idea that students can improve their ability. At the most basic level, mindset techniques involve shifting emphasis away from outcomes and toward efforts and process. Rather than praising an accomplishment, the instructor praises the efforts and learning steps that led to the positive outcome.

Looking at examples of how instruction and language can be altered to encourage a growth mindset illustrates how teachers can change the way that students perceive the learning process:

Another example stresses the importance of encouraging students to work through problems:

Teaching students to be encouraged when they experience difficulty can also reinforce growth mindset:

A growth mindset approach still demands optimal performance from a student—simply rewarding efforts isn’t effective, and, in fact, it can be harmful if the student’s efforts are ultimately fruitless.

Part of growth mindset instruction is teaching students to ask for help and to use any resources that can assist them. Just as students are still responsible for learning the material, teachers are still responsible for giving them the tools they need to learn.

Helping students develop a growth mindset requires deliberate effort from teachers, but many of the methods can be easily integrated in their existing practices. The following strategies and tips can help educators foster a growth mindset in the classroom:

1. Normalize struggle. Struggle is part of the learning process, and emphasizing and reinforcing that idea helps students react positively when they feel challenged.

2. Encourage engagement with challenges. Portray challenges as fun and exciting, and easy tasks as boring.

3. Embrace the word “yet”. If someone makes the statement “I’m not a math person,” adding a simple qualifier will signal that a process exists for gaining ability. “You’re not a math person yet.”

4. Tout the value of hard tasks to the brain. Promote the idea that brains are malleable “muscles” that can be developed. Research on brain plasticity supports the idea of neural growth, and mindset research has shown that believing the brain can grow has a demonstrative effect on behavior and achievement.

5. Demonstrate mistakes and celebrate corrections. Mistakes should be viewed as learning opportunities. Teachers can model this outlook in reactions to their own mistakes and steps they take to correct a mistake.

6. Set goals. Having students set incremental, achievable goals demonstrates the attainability of growth and progress.

7. Develop cooperative exercises. Working together to solve problems emphasizes process and reinforces the importance of getting help and finding solutions. It also deemphasizes individual outcomes.

8. Provide challenges. Part of developing a growth mindset is teaching students to overcome obstacles. A particularly hard math problem or complex writing assignment that stretches their abilities can provide opportunities for growth and further instruction that emphasizes problem-solving.

9. Avoid praising intelligence. This may seem counterintuitive, but praise for “being smart” reinforces the idea that intelligence is a fixed trait. This can be demotivating for the students being praised (“I’m smart; I don’t have to try harder”), as well as for those who don’t not receive the praise (“That student is smart; I’m not”).

10. Don’t oversimplify. “You can do anything!” may feel like harmless encouragement, but if students aren’t put in a position to overcome challenges, they’ll conclude that such statements are empty, and the educator will lose credibility.

Extending the concept of growth mindset theory to teachers and administrators is critical. Research suggests that growth mindset approaches are more effective in supportive environments. However, individuals interested in promoting growth mindset initiatives can encounter resistance. Cultural changes in any institution or system are difficult, but understanding those challenges is the first step to finding common ground and moving forward.

Changing the instructional practices and policies that teachers and administrators have established can be difficult for many reasons:

Efforts to overcome resistance to growth mindset initiatives should focus on the demonstrated benefits to students. A shared goal of helping students can ease the challenges of culture change.

Working together to reframe their shared challenges and goals can help both teachers and administrators develop growth mindsets and culture:

1. Value the process over the result. Valuing the process over the result can be difficult in a results-driven environment, but teachers and administrators who value the growth mindset and its long-term benefits are more likely to stay the course.

2. View challenges as opportunities. Students aren’t the only ones facing challenges; teachers and administrators can benefit just as much from an outlook that celebrates the process.

3. Experiment with different teaching methods and learning strategies. Helping students build the skills they need to improve is a key element of the growth mindset approach. Teachers and administrators who embrace a growth mindset shouldn’t be afraid to experiment.

4. Celebrate growth. Finding teaching strategies that reach students and help them learn should be celebrated with the students, as well as with other teachers and administrators. This reinforces the emphasis on effort and process. It also provides opportunities to share valuable learnings.

5. Communicate about your growth mindset. Sharing successes and failures among teachers and administrators helps to establish a culture that values challenges and a growth mindset.

A growth mindset’s defining characteristic—the belief that intelligence is malleable—provides a powerful formula for improving student outcomes. Students who believe that they can get smarter and that effort makes them smarter will put in the effort that leads to higher achievement.

The understanding that they can always learn new skills and overcome challenges through hard work is a lesson students can carry well beyond their school years. As the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated, many of the learning challenges that students will face can’t be foreseen. By helping them develop a mindset that doesn’t shrink from challenges and teaching them learning methods that can be applied to any subject or obstacle, educators prepare students for increasingly dynamic work environments and an increasingly complex world.

Educators interested in how education and learning can be life changing should explore American University’s School of Education degree programs, including its online Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) and online Master of Education (MEd) in Education Policy and Leadership. Preparing teachers and policy makers to transform the education system to benefit all learners is a core principle of American University’s School of Education.

# Student mental mindset – Taking Learning Seriously

Taking Learning Seriously

The Science of Learning for Teachers & Students

What is the cognitive challenge of student mental mindset?

Students hold attitudes and beliefs about a course or topic, such as how interesting or valuable it will be and how capable they are to master it through their own efforts. Students may believe a course is irrelevant to them or that they lack the ability needed to learn the content.



by Stephen L. Chew, Samford University

This video focuses on student mental mindset and will enhance the text below.

Student Example

A student is required to take calculus for her economics major. The student dreads it because her past negative experiences with math have convinced her that she hates studying math and she has little math ability.

Description of the Challenge

Mental mindset refers to the students’ attitudes, beliefs, and expectations about a course or subject (Chew, 2014). Mental mindset encompasses the teacher, course, topic, pedagogy, method of assessment, and beliefs about the likelihood of their success in the course through their own efforts. Students come into a class with pre-conceived notions of how valuable the course will be to them, how important the course is compared to other courses they are taking, how hard the course will be for them, and what is a reasonable workload for the course. For example, Cahill, et al., (2018) found that student attitudes towards physics predicted student learning across different topics, courses, teaching styles, and assessments, even after controlling for prior knowledge.  De Corte, Verschaffel, and Depaepe (2008) explored the false and negative beliefs about math held by fifth-graders, and found that improvements in classroom culture improved both math learning and math beliefs.

Dweck and colleagues have explored the impact of implicit theories of intelligence on learning (Yeager & Dweck, 2012; Yeager, et al., 2019). Implicit theories fall along a spectrum.  At one extreme are entity or fixed theories, which hold that intelligence or ability is set and unchangeable through personal effort. Students with fixed mindsets see effort as a sign of weakness and they avoid challenges because failure cannot be overcome through effort. A fixed mindset undermines resilience in the face of setbacks. On the other end of the spectrum are incremental or growth mindsets. Students with growth mindsets see intellectual ability as a malleable trait that can be cultivated and enhanced through personal effort. Students with growth mindsets are more likely to embrace intellectual challenges as opportunities to learn and grow, and they are more likely to be resilient in the face of setbacks. Growth or incremental mindset is likely related to the concept of academic self-efficacy (Zimmerman, 2000), which refers to students’ belief in their own capability to learn. Academic self-efficacy is strongly linked to learning and motivation.

Recommendations

Teachers must be aware of student mindsets in the classes they teach. From the first day, teachers should highlight the value and importance of the class to students, for their majors, or their careers, or simply to help understand issues they may encounter. Even if students did sign up for this course because it met a general educational requirement, and it was the only one not meeting at 8:00 am, and their buddy was already enrolled, this is going to be a valuable course that the students would have wanted to take anyway.

There is good evidence that a negative or counterproductive mindset can be corrected through targeted interventions or effective pedagogy. Yeager, et al. (2016) discusses how to design interventions for improving fixed student mindset. Active learning strategies that enhance student achievement improve academic self-efficacy (Ballen, Wieman, Salehi, Searle, & Zamudio, 2017). Formative assessments can promote both growth mindset and academic self-efficacy (Yin, et al., 2008). DeCorte, et al., (2008) found that changing classroom culture to improve student support and sense of belongingness brought about an improved mindset toward math in fifth-grade students. Mindset is related to the challenges of misconceptions and to student fear and mistrust. Much more research needs to be carried out in how to improve mental mindset.

# Perception and knowledge of critical thinking: A qualitative research study with Professors of Higher Education in Oman | Abasaid | Journal of Educational Studies and Multidisciplinary Approaches

Critical thinking is a key feature of the organizational cultures of higher education institutions, given its multiple impacts on graduates’ academic, professional and personal levels. Thus, most of these higher education institutions in the Arab Gulf region state in their strategic plans, implicitly and explicitly, objectives related to enhancing students’ critical thinking skills. Despite the apparent prevalence of such objectives, the concept of critical thinking (CT) is hardly taught in higher education institutions in the Arab Gulf region for different reasons. One of these reasons is that the perception of the concept is still in its infancy in the region, even among professors. This study aims to investigate how the perceptions and knowledge of critical thinking of English as a Second Language professors in the General Foundation Program at the College, a higher education institution in Muscat, foster critical thinking teaching. This is a qualitative and exploratory study with 10 professors and the data were collected through semi-structured interviews. The thematic analysis identified 4 themes: 1. First encounter with CT; 2. Connotations and denotations of CT; 3. Attainability of CT; 4. Scarce teaching of CT. The participants revealed their belief in the attainability of critical thinking. However, they expressed difficulties in implementing critical thinking teaching in their classrooms. The General Foundation Program’s professors referred openly to the disparity between their espoused beliefs and enacted practices.

# Frontiers | A teachers’ based approach to assessing the perception of critical thinking in Education university students based on their age and gender

In the 21st century, critical thinking (CT) is regularly presented as one of the most important competences to be developed by a majority of educational institutions. Teachers are expected to change and enrich their teaching and learning methodologies so that students could face future challenges. Nonetheless, few are the instruments that measure the perception of critical thinking based on teachers’ conception. The aim of this study is to design and validate an instrument for the assessment of CT in university students based on the conception of CT that university teachers have. For this study, a total of 312 Spanish university students have participated. Based on a good model fit from a Confirmatory Factor Analysis and good reliability indices, the results provide strength to the theoretical model to evaluate critical thinking in university students formed by six dimensions (Analyzing/Organizing; Reasoning/Argumenting; Questioning/Asking oneself; Evaluating; Positioning /Taking decisions, and Acting /Committing oneself) and 42 items. Similarly, age was not a predictor variable for the different dimensions; while gender was statistically in favor of women in some of the dimensions, and tendentially, the dimension of Positioning/Taking decisions, in favor of men. However, despite these differences, the model guaranteed its factorial invariance. These findings have important pedagogical implications for universities in particular, and educational institutions in general, when developing curricula and teaching plans that focus on the development of students’ critical thinking.

We live in a globalized society, where information input is abundant, sometimes excessive, for the time available. Consequently, discriminating which information is truthful, adequate, or simply useful for our purposes is a difficult task. Therefore, critical thinking (henceforth, CT) may be considered an important and basic competence required in university education for the academic and labor success of students (Tremblay et al., 2012; Peeler, 2016; Bezanilla et al., 2021; World Economic Forum, 2021). There are, however, discrepancies in the literature, as some researchers consider it a general domain competence, like reading or writing, and state that it may be taught regardless of a discipline, while other researchers consider it as a domain-specific competence that should be taught differently depending on the knowledge area (nursing, education, engineering…; Davies, 2013; Saturno et al., 2019).

Lai (2011) stated how CT had been conceptualized in different ways over the years depending on the view taken. The most relevant approaches were the philosophical approach that highlighted the qualities of an ideal critical thinker, the psychological approach that emphasized on the cognitive process of developing CT, and the educational approach that underlined the utility of CT. Regardless of the approach, Facione (1990b), after carrying out an expert consensus in the United States with researchers, educators, employers, and policymakers, agreed that the cognitive components of CT skills should include analysis, interpretation, judgment, evaluation, inference, and decision-making. Nevertheless, the disposition component of the CT was at the same time addressed with the skills component (e.g., Facione et al., 1995), as it was observed that CT disposition was also a crucial component for a critical thinker (Ennis, 1996). A disposition is a tendency of someone to do something in specific cases. Hence, it could be considered as an attribute or habit that is included into one’s beliefs and actions to effectively solve problems and take solid decisions (Fitriani et al., 2018).

Some authors understand these dispositions as attitudes and behaviors when facing historical and social injustices and inequalities (Pennell, 2018; Cummings, 2019), as well as metacognition and self-regulation processes that may help in order to improve the rest of skills (e.g., Facione, 1991; Facione et al., 2016; Bezanilla et al., 2018). In fact, recent research has shown a significant association between CT skills and metacognitive abilities (e.g., Lukitasari et al., 2019).

Critical thinking could, therefore, be understood as the sum of skills and dispositions that facilitate the contrast to achieve trustful information and the orientation to decision-making processes (Akramova, 2017). Indeed, as commented by Fitriani et al. (2018), a good critical thinker combines empowerment of critical thinking skills by maintaining a solid critical thinking disposition.

In addition, previous literature has delved into the potential differences of CT skills and dispositions depending on the age and the gender of the students. First, with regard to the age, previous literature has examined the potential differences according to age in the development of CT skills. On this topic, previous studies revealed that there are low differences over the academic years (e.g., Giancarlo and Facione, 2001), or that there are no significant differences over the academic years (e.g., Profetto-McGrath, 2003). In addition, previous research showed non-significant differences in CT dispositions based on university students’ academic year (Bakir, 2015; Akgun and Duruk, 2016; Turan, 2016). However, this question is still being discussed as other studies revealed that third/fourth year’s higher education students had higher CT scores in contrast to their first-year peers (e.g., Roohr et al., 2019).

Likewise, when assessing the CT skills and dispositions of university students, some researchers have shed some light on analyses according to gender. Specifically, the vast majority of previous studies suggest that there are no significant differences between gender in CT skills (Bagheri and Ghanizadeh, 2016; Salahshoor and Rafiee, 2016), as well as in CT dispositions (Akgun and Duruk, 2016), or that the effect size of these differences are low for both in CT skills (Mahanal, 2012; Miftahul et al., 2017; Shubina and Kulaki, 2019), and in CT dispositions (Bakir, 2015; Turan, 2016). For instance, Shubina and Kulaki (2019) found significant differences in favor of women in inference and deduction, but non-significant differences in recognition of assumptions, interpretation, and evaluation of arguments. Despite these differences, it should be emphasized, as indicated by Miftahul et al. (2017), that gender only contributes minimally to the development of critical thinking, and according to this author, it is essential to deepen into new methodologies and learning styles that allow enhancing all critical thinking skills, regardless of gender.

Since the 1980s, higher education institutions have increased their interest in assessing CT (Calle Álvarez, 2013). Some reasons why CT should be assessed include the effectiveness for diagnosing the initial level of students, the helpfulness of giving feedback and guide students on their progress, the value of motivating students to acquire critical thinking, or the utility for establishing a well-defined and adjusted curriculum plan and activities, to name but a few (Madariaga and Schaffernicht, 2013). However, due to the fact that CT has been defined in different ways, the assessment tools also tend to consist of multiple ways of assessing this competence (Liu et al., 2014).

Based on Ossa-Cornejo et al. (2017) systematic review, the most common CT assessment tests are those formed by multiple-choice questions with closed answers and open questions in which students need to develop their answers in writing (Madariaga and Schaffernicht, 2013), and those formed by multiple-choice, agree and disagree format or rating format. This last type of test is more objective and easier for assessing, but may have validity problems (Ennis, 1993). An adapted summary of the most common existing CT assessment tools is collected in Table 1.

Table 1. Analysis of common instruments to assess critical thinking.


The vast majority of instruments include dimensions related to inductive or deductive analysis (Ennis and Millman, 1985; Facione, 1990a; Halpern, 1998; Saiz and Rivas, 2008; Rivas and Saiz, 2012; Facione et al., 2016; Shaw et al., 2019); interpretation (Watson and Glaser, 1980; Facione, 1990a; Facione et al., 2016); explanation (Facione, 1990a; Facione et al., 2016); assumptions (Watson and Glaser, 1980; Ennis and Millman, 1985); inference (Watson and Glaser, 1980; Facione, 1990a; Facione et al., 2016); reasoning and argument justification (Halpern, 1998; Saiz and Rivas, 2008; Rivas and Saiz, 2012; Shaw et al., 2019; Hollis et al., 2020); evaluating information’s and arguments’ credibility (Watson and Glaser, 1980; Ennis and Millman, 1985; Facione, 1990a; Haynes et al., 2015; Facione et al., 2016; Shaw et al., 2019); decision making and problem-solving (Halpern, 1998; Saiz and Rivas, 2008; Rivas and Saiz, 2012; Haynes et al., 2015); and self-regulation (Facione, 1990a; Facione et al., 2016). As can be seen, despite the fact that the literature claims the relevance of dispositions when measuring CT, the vast majority of scales does not include any dimension related to dispositions.

Regardless of the instrument used to assess CT, as stated in Ossa-Cornejo et al. (2018), there is a need to continue developing models to properly assess and develop CT that may meet the requirements and challenges of university education due to the insecurities that educators show in this matter (Choy and Cheah, 2009; Aliakbari and Sadeghdaghighi, 2012; Stedman and Adams, 2012).

Bezanilla et al. (2018) made a new proposal for assessing CT skills and dispositions based on an inductive analysis carried out amongst university teachers on their conception of CT. This model was built in order to attempt to deal with some of the limitations that have been found in the literature regarding the measurement of CT, such as the following:

1. The vast majority of instruments are focused on the skills required for an ideal critical thinker, leaving aside the disposition part of CT.

2. Some instruments present a high degree of complexity for their understanding. Therefore, there is a need for a solid training on the theoretical model behind that instrument, assuming the economic and functional resources this action could require.

3. In addition, a payment is sometimes required to use certain instruments. Hence, not all institutions can afford these expenses.

4. Finally, some instruments have low reliability indices. As previously mentioned, measuring critical thinking is not an easy task and there is a need to improve the reliability and validity of instruments.

The resultant model from the inductive analysis carried out by Bezanilla et al. (2018) was formed by six dimensions and is coherent with some of the most common dimensions found in the literature of CT assessment. The dimensions are explained below:

• Analyzing/Organizing: Understanding CT as a way of examining in detail something (a text, a reality), considering its parts in order to know its characteristics and draw conclusions. In some cases, it includes aspects related to the structuring and organization of information, but does not go beyond this.

• Reasoning/Argumenting: This category adds the relation and comparison of ideas and experiences on the basis of arguments, in order to draw conclusions and form a reasoned judgment. It involves expressing in words or in writing reasons for or against something, or to justify it as a reasonable action to convey content and promote understanding.

• Questioning/Asking oneself: Critical thinking is understood as the questioning of an issue that is controversial or commonly accepted by asking a series of questions. It means to question issues, to ask oneself questions about the reality in which one lives.

• Evaluating: It means to value, to ponder, to determine the value of something, to estimate the importance of a fact taking into account various elements or criteria. It is more than an argumentation (e.g., to deduce pros and cons of a reality) because it implies to determine the value of something based on certain criteria.

• Taking a position/Making decisions: It involves not only analyzing, reasoning, questioning, or evaluating, but also making a decision. It implies giving a solution or a definitive judgment on an issue in such a way that it includes adopting a position or proposing a solution.

• Acting/Committing oneself. CT is understood as a means of transforming reality through social commitment. It is to move to action, to act, to behave by performing voluntary and conscious acts in a determined and committed way. It implies the adoption of a certain attitude or position before a certain issue.

Based on this model, the purpose of this study has been the following one:

O1: Design and validate an instrument for the assessment of CT in university students based on the conception of CT that university teachers have. For this purpose, the model proposed by Bezanilla et al. (2018) was used.

O2: Analyze possible differences among the main dimensions of the questionnaire with regard to age.

O3: Analyze possible differences among the main dimensions of the questionnaire with regard to gender.

Using non-probabilistic methods based on teachers’ proximity, the sample of this study included 312 undergraduate university students (Age = 20.42; SD = 1.34) from public and private universities of the Basque Country (Spain). The students took part in degrees related to different areas of Education and Sports Sciences. From the total number of participants, 105 were men and 207 were women; 255 came from the University of Deusto (private) and 57 came from the University of the Basque Country (public). Regarding their university degree, 32 were students in the Degree in Early Childhood Education, 139 were studying the Degree in Primary Education, 18 studied the Degree in Social Education/Work, 88 studied the double degree in Primary Education and Physical Activity and Sports Sciences, 23 studied the Degree in Physical Activity and Sports Sciences, and 12 studied other Degrees. The distribution by academic year was 42 students in the 1st year of their degree; 62 in the 2nd year of their bachelor’s degree, 139 in their 3rd year of bachelor’s degree; 58 in their 4th year degree, and 11 in their 5th year degree (for those in a Double Degree). A summary of the main characteristics of the sample is collected in Table 2.

Table 2. Descriptive statistics of the sample.


In order to accomplish the objectives of this research a questionnaire was designed. After the review of different models and instruments to measure and assess critical thinking, a multiple-choice questionnaire, based on Bezanilla et al. (2021) model, was built. This model is coherent with other existing ones, since it includes elements related to analysis, evaluation, self-regulation, reasoning, argumentation, and decision making, among others (Watson and Glaser, 1980; Halpern, 1998; Rivas and Saiz, 2012; Facione and Facione, 2013; Haynes et al., 2015; Facione et al., 2016; Shaw et al., 2019), but adds some specificities derived from university teachers’ concept of CT, such as questioning or acting/committing oneself, which add the contextualization of the scale in the field of higher education teaching and learning. The items from the questionnaire were fully developed by the authors of this research, based on the dimensions of the theoretical model used. A summary of the item distribution is gathered in Table 3 and the description of all the items is shown in Supplementary Appendix S1.

Table 3. Distribution of the items per dimensions.


The answers were proposed on a Likert scale ranging from never (1) to always (5), and the participants were asked to answer with the perception of their performance in the situations given in the items. In addition, some individual characteristics were asked, like university type, gender, age, degree and course.

The procedure began with the elaboration of a group of items based on previous studies. At this point, 69 items were proposed after having gone through a pilot phase (n = 50) carried out with university students. The deans and degree coordinators of the faculties gave their permission to collect data after understanding the aim and ethical procedures of the research. In this pilot phase, the students, through their voluntary participation and always respecting their anonymity and privacy, were asked to accept the terms of the study. Considering the results of the pilot phase, relevant changes were introduced to the instrument and the final questionnaire was completed by a larger sample group following the same previous procedure. At this stage, the initial sample for the pilot phase participated again with the last version of the instrument. It should be added that students were asked for their email in case they wanted to receive a report with the main results of the study. For both, pilot instrument and final instrument, an online survey was created. Students completed the questionnaire through Google Forms outside university classes.

In order to respond to Objective 1 of this study, the data analysis procedure started with a pilot phase carrying out an exploratory factor analysis (EFA), accompanied by a study of each dimension’s reliability. Taking as a starting point the results of the pilot phase and the total sample, a model fit analysis was carried out through a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and its corresponding analysis of the X2/df (Chi-Square/degrees of freedom), CFI (Comparative Fit Index), RMSEA (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation) and AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) indexes, factor loadings (λ), αID (Cronbach’s alpha if item is deleted), and modification indexes (M. I.) in order to improve the theoretical model.

Finally, so as to give an answer to Objective 2 of this study, a series of regression analyses were performed to find out if age was a predictor of the different critical thinking skills. Likewise, to reply to Objective 3 of this study, an independent sample Student’s t-test was performed to find out possible significant differences between genders. As significant differences were found, a multi-group analysis of factor invariance was performed so as to check whether the model was acceptable for males and females.

With regard to objective 1 (O1), the design and validation of the instrument was done. First, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to determine the dimensionality of the instrument and the relevance of each item with its factor (Supplementary Appendix S1) using the preliminary instrument in a pilot phase (n = 50). For the selection of the final items, those with factor loadings λ <0.40 for its factor and/or improvement of alpha values if the item was deleted (αID), as collected in Table 4, were eliminated from this preliminary phase (Galindo-Domínguez, 2020). From this procedure, the initial 69 items were reduced to 48 items.

Table 4. Items removed after the exploratory factor analysis (n = 50).


Afterwards, the final phase began by studying the model fit. In this sense, the model fit was relatively good, although it could be improved (X2/df = 2.03; CFI = 0.795; RMSEA = 0.058; AIC = 2489.14). In order to improve the model fit, those items with low factor loadings were eliminated. Thus, AN07 (λ = 0.370), PO02 (λ = 0.411), AC03 (λ = 0.394), AC04 (λ = 0.409) were eliminated. At this point, the model fit improved (X2/df = 2.00; CFI = 0.823; RMSEA = 0.057; AIC = 2074.80), although the modification indexes had not been studied.

For this reason, an analysis of the Modification Index (M. I.) was carried out. Special attention was paid to those pairs of items with M.I. greater than 15, making decisions from higher to lower criticality (Galindo-Domínguez, 2020). After all the modifications and decisions were made, listed in Table 5, the questionnaire was concluded by eliminating items EV03 and EV06.

Table 5. Decisions taken for the study of the modification index (MI).


The model fit of the final model was significantly better than that of the initial model (X2/df = 1.86; CFI = 0.849; RMSEA = 0.053; AIC = 1778.56). It should be remembered that despite not reaching values in the incremental indexes (e.g., CFI) higher than 0.90, as stated by Kenny (2020), those theoretically more complex models are penalized in the model fit. After the CFA and the decisions made, the number of items of the final instrument was reduced to 42. The main results of the CFA are illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Confirmatory factor analysis. An/Or, analyzing/organizing; Ar/Re, reasoning/argumenting; Qu/Ao, questioning/asking oneself; Eval, evaluating; Po/De, positioning/taking decisions; Ac/Co, acting/committing oneself.

Studying the reliability of the 6 dimensions, these were all acceptable for carrying out research [Analyzing/Organizing: α = 747; Reasoning/Argumenting: α = 0.838; Questioning/Asking oneself: α = 0.732; Evaluating: α = 0.817; Taking a position/Taking decisions: α = 0.701; Acting / Committing oneself: α = 726].

With regard to the second objective of the research (O2), it was verified whether age functioned as a predictor of the different dimensions of critical thinking. Results revealed non-significant differences for all dimensions (Analyzing/Organizing = β = −0.014; p = 0.446; Reasoning/Argumenting = β = −0.019; p = 0.267; Questioning/Asking oneself = β = 0.009; p = 0.609; Evaluating = β = 0.000; p = 0.992; Positioning/Taking Decisions = β = −0.018; p = 0.349; Acting/Committing oneself = β = −0.006; p = 0.714). These data showed that skills are inherent to individuals, regardless of higher education students’ age, considering that our sample is formed mostly by students from 18 to 22 years old.

Finally, with regard to the third objective of the research (O3), possible significant differences according to gender were studied. This analysis, as seen in Table 6, highlighted the significant differences found in certain dimensions of the model. More specifically, statistically significant differences were found in the dimensions of Questioning/Asking oneself (p = 0.005; d = 0.35) and Acting/Committing oneself (p = 0.002; d = 0.34) in favor of women, with medium effect sizes. There was also a trend value in favor of men in the Positioning/Taking decisions dimension (p = 0.088; d = 0.19) with a small effect size.

Table 6. Student’s t test for independent samples based on gender.


Despite these differences in gender, the theoretical model ensured its factorial invariance as shown in Table 7, since changes of less than 0.01 were observed in the ΔCFI and ΔRMSEA coefficients (Cheung and Rensvold, 2002).

Table 7. Analysis of factorial invariance as a function of gender.


The main objective of this study has been to design and validate an instrument to evaluate critical thinking in university students. In view of the results obtained, the validation has been completed with the presentation of a valid and reliable instrument made up of 42 items to measure in students the six main dimensions of the original theoretical model: Analyzing/Organizing; Reasoning/Argumenting; Questioning/Asking oneself; Evaluating; Positioning/Taking decisions; and Acting/Committing oneself. In view of these results, it seems that the model based on 6 dimensions created from the inductive analysis of teachers’ perceptions carried out in Bezanilla et al. (2018) gains validity to be used in future research.

In addition, another objective of this research was to analyze potential differences according to age. Findings revealed non-significant differences in CT dimensions in relation to age. These results are coherent with previous research that revealed small or non-significant differences in CT skills (e.g., Giancarlo and Facione, 2001; Profetto-McGrath, 2003), as well as in CT dispositions (e.g., Bakir, 2015; Akgun and Duruk, 2016; Turan, 2016) regarding age. Nevertheless, as stated in the theoretical review, this question is still being discussed as other studies revealed better scores in CT skills in third/fourth year’s higher education students in contrast to their first-year peers (e.g., Roohr et al., 2019). Therefore, the debate would be if a real development of CT skills should reach significant differences over the university academic years. That is, the debate arises about the importance and the ways of developing CT to make a difference between the students’ thinking processes when they start higher education studies and when they finish their training years. If the development of CT skills is important in higher education, some change should be expected s when the application is planned and guaranteed.

Finally, the last objective of this research was to analyze potential differences according to gender. Findings revealed that while there were some minimum differences in questioning/asking oneself and acting/committing oneself in favor of females, there were small differences in positioning/taking decisions in favor of males. Non-significant differences were found in analyzing/organizing, reasoning/argumenting, and evaluating dimensions. These results are partially shared by previous research that found non-significant differences between genders in CT skills (Bagheri and Ghanizadeh, 2016; Salahshoor and Rafiee, 2016), as well as in CT dispositions (Akgun and Duruk, 2016), or that the effect size of these differences are low in CT skills (Mahanal, 2012; Miftahul et al., 2017; Shubina and Kulaki, 2019), as well as in CT dispositions (Bakir, 2015; Turan, 2016).

These results have important theoretical and practical implications for the teaching and learning of critical thinking in higher education. In relation to the theoretical implications, these results contribute by providing a new approach to the evaluation of critical thinking based on teachers’ understanding of the concept of CT. The design and validation of the scale presented could be useful for future research to develop critical thinking conception and dimensions.

In regards to the practical implications, firstly, these results allow institutions to develop curricular plans that promote the development of the CT dimensions set out in this model. In fact, as stated by Liu et al. (2014), despite the fact that higher education institutions recognize the relevance of CT, not many offer specific training for fostering CT. Based on the validated model in this study, higher education institutions could use it as a reference for generating specific training for their teachers as well as for their students. The model could also be used to measure longitudinal changes on CT skills and dispositions along the years.

In addition, these results allow teachers to make use of a solid instrument in order to know the effectiveness of a specific training program that involves the development of critical thinking competence among its learning objectives. Therefore, it can be used for diagnosis purposes.

Furthermore, these results give consistency to the original theoretical model of six dimensions for the development of CT (Bezanilla et al., 2018). This scheme based on six dimensions could permit teachers to elaborate guides and teaching plans in order to develop each of the different CT dimensions throughout teaching units and materials. In this sense, a series of educational actions for each dimension can be carried out:

– To promote the Analyzing/Organizing dimension it is proposed to include in the classroom the use of observation, reading, handling and structuring information (Bezanilla et al., 2018; Alsaleh, 2020), marking up a text according to instructions provided or creating diagrams in which, based on the material supplied, students must produce or fill a diagram that analyzes or evaluates a certain material (Liu et al., 2014). Moreover, some authors like Williams and Moore (2021) revealed the utility of thinking routines, like I see, I think, I wonder thinking routine for promoting CT skills, such as analyzing/organizing skill.

– To promote the Reasoning/Argumenting dimension, classroom activities could involve relating, comparing and justifying (Bezanilla et al., 2018), like debates, short constructed-response (students must respond in their own words to a prompt based on text), statements’ identification and selection from a list for the construction of certain ideas, or comparing for and against arguments (Liu et al., 2014).

– To promote the Questioning/Asking oneself dimension, it is proposed to make use of activities that involve asking, investigating, contrasting or debating. Alsaleh (2020) adds the relevance of teaching questioning techniques, like thinking routines (e.g., I see, I think, I wonder; 3–2-1 bridge…), used for example in Williams and Moore (2021), in order to develop this skill.

– To promote the Evaluating dimension, it is suggested the usage of activities that involve discriminating, weighting, evaluating or ranking ideas and information, like an essay where students are asked to evaluate an argument made for a particular conclusion, or an activity in which students are required to match evidence statements with their conclusion (Liu et al., 2014; Bezanilla et al., 2018).

– To promote the Positioning/Taking decisions dimension, it is proposed to make use of activities that involve discerning, making judgments and proposing solutions.

– To promote the Acting/Committing oneself dimension, it is suggested to make use of activities that encourage active participation, commitment and the involvement and transformation of reality, such as Service Learning or volunteer participation in NGOs, among others.

Previous evidence has shown that the type of methodology used in class affects the development of CT (Tiwari et al., 2006; Bezanilla et al., 2019, to name a few). For instance, Mahanal et al. (2019) revealed using the RICOSRE problem-based learning model that students’ CT skills may be promoted more than conventional teaching methods. This model is divided into 6 different stages which require the use of different CT skills: (1) reading the case; (2) identifying the problem; (3) constructing the solution; (4) solving the problem; (5) reviewing the solution; (6) extending the solution. However, as commented in Cáceres et al. (2020), teachers consider that the development of CT skills may vary depending on each subject they are teaching, and hence, some skills may be more related to certain subjects than others.

Finally, results revealed small differences concerning gender. Despite the fact that it could be an aspect to consider when planning teachers’ lessons based on their students’ characteristics, as commented by Miftahul et al. (2017), gender may contribute minimally to the development of CT, and hence, it may be essential to deepen into new methodologies and learning styles that may allow enhancing all critical thinking skills, regardless of gender.

This research is not exempted from limitations that should be taken into account when interpreting the results. First, the sample used in the study is based on students enrolled exclusively in universities in the Basque Country (Spain). In this sense, future research could try to replicate the present work by involving students from other national and international universities. Also, a diverse sample could enrich the data and implications of the instrument in terms of equity (Roksa et al., 2017).

Second, the instrument presented is an instrument based on perceptions of different facets of real-life situations and not a performance-based assessment, which is an approach that other authors of this field are working on (e.g., Shavelson et al., 2019). Therefore, it is necessary for future studies to elaborate and use other instruments that measure the “real” competence or performance, not just self-perception, as well as the possible correlation between self-perception instruments and other performance-based assessment techniques.

Third, a solid instrument for assessment has been validated which does not have the possible problems that qualitative assessments can present (Rivas and Saiz, 2012; Verburgh et al., 2013). Nonetheless, it could be interesting to create a mix of qualitative and quantitative scales in order to contrast the validity and reliability of these new types of scales in comparison with just quantitative scales.

Fourth, unlike models based on a more philosophical point of view, the focus on education and, more specifically, the point of view of the teacher regarding CT has been considered in this case. However, future studies could attempt to analyze students’ conception of CT and compare their views with the current model and scale based on teachers’ conceptions, presented in this study.

Fifth, the scale presented in this study may be considered as a general domain scale as it has been created from an understanding of CT as a competence that could be developed transversely regardless of students’ area of knowledge. Nevertheless, future research should shed some light on criteria validity of how CT as a general domain competence is associated with CT specific domains.

Finally, this research does not analyze the predictive validity of CT on certain variables. Hence, future research should be focused on analyzing the potential effects of CT skills and dispositions when predicting desirable outcomes (e.g., job or academic performance; Liu et al., 2014). An example of how this limitation is being addressed can be found in the study carried out by Shaw et al. (2019) where, after validating the HEIghten® critical thinking assessment scale, they showed how students that scored high in CT skills also had higher academic achievement (Pearson’s r ranging from 0.18 to 0.37).

Despite all these limitations, we can conclude that this instrument, and the main conclusions drawn from the study, will be useful for the assessment of critical thinking areas through valid and reliable tools. Likewise, this validated instrument could lead to teaching plans, activities in the classroom and assessment of training programs that may have a significant impact in the development of CT skills.

# What makes a good student? How to be a successful student

Select Page

Posted by Linda Stade | Aug 12, 2022 | Learning, Schools | 






Inside: What are the characteristics of a good student? Here are 10 traits and habits that successful students usually share. The good news is, that most of these can be taught. 

Being a good student doesn’t just mean achieving high scores on tests. It means having:

So what are the traits and habits that shape a good student? The following is not an exhaustive list, however, it is a very good start and you can also download a useful poster at the bottom of the article.

A growth mindset is a deeply held belief that a person can learn anything given enough time and effort. Carol Dweck is a Professor of Psychology at Stanford University. She is the world’s most recognised student of the mindset trait. In her 2014 Ted talk, Dweck spoke about growth mindset in terms of, ‘The power of yet’.

When your child says, “I can’t do this”, then you need to add, “Yet. I can’t do this yet”. Dweck’s research shows that even explaining this concept to a child will affect the way they view their learning. She points to evidence that says, an understanding of growth mindset changes neural pathways that allow for greater growth in learning.



Brave kids are going to be the ones who take risks and amass experiences. They can use those experiences powerfully in their learning and growing. They quickly establish what they love and loathe and then they are more likely to create a life they love. They are also going to be the students who take learning risks that lead to lateral, out of the box thinking. The world needs that kind of thinker.

Bravery is about taking on daunting challenges; feeling the fear and doing it anyway. Bravery is not the absence of fear. Sometimes when we talk to our kids we say, “Don’t be afraid” or “Don’t be silly, it’s going to be fine”. This implies that fear is something to be ashamed of. It isn’t. Fear is human and to be expected, but it also needs to be overcome. That won’t just happen by magic. It comes with modelling, teaching and explaining.

A high school student can study as many as nine different subjects with nine different teachers and nine different sets of expectations. It is impossible to thrive under those circumstances unless a child is highly organised. Fortunately, organisation is something we can teach. We can also employ aids like diaries, planners and study schedules.

What are the qualities of a good student?

Learning happens slowly and consistently. Take for example the process we went through when we learned to read.  There were steps, from holding a book the right way up, to recognising letters to phonetics, years of practising and finally fluency.  It’s not actually that hard to learn to read for neurotypical kids, but you do have to develop building blocks and commit to regular practise. It is the willingness to practise that contributes to success as a student.

Consistency is becoming less common in adolescents. Some of the areas most affected by teens’ lack of consistency are mathematics, music and languages. In each of these areas, there needs to be a mastery of some basic skills that only comes with practise.

Failure is one of the greatest tools in the learning process. Unfortunately, too many people are simply overwhelmed by the feeling of failure rather than being able to stand back and look at the lessons it can teach us. Having the tenacity to stare down failure is an extraordinary skill.

Teach kids to look at failure in an analytical way. What is the size and gravity of the failure? What are its consequences? What can be learnt from the experience?



Goal setting focuses a student’s attention towards certain behaviours and information and away from distractions. Research tells us that incremental goals are far more effective than large goals.

If a student is able to break down a big goal, like solving a big problem, innovating or achieving a higher grade, into small bite-sized pieces they are more likely to be successful. If they can incorporate the feedback they receive on each occasion, the small wins eventually lead to big achievements.

A successful student is able to see their studies in the context of the wider world. If a child has read, observed and discussed the world, issues and ideas on a regular basis, they will be able to place their learning in context. Without context, it is easy to understand why a child would think, “What’s the point?”

It is up to parents to ensure children are exposed to a multitude of ideas and rich resources and experiences. It is up to teachers to ensure that what happens in the classroom is linked to what exists in the wider world. That sense of relevance is vital for developing in kids a love of learning. It gives school relevance beyond just doing well in testing



One of the greatest obstacles to a child’s academic success can be their mental health. Anxiety, in particular, is a growing concern in Australian schools.  A large-scale 2018 study, conducted by the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) found that “nearly half of Australian students reported feeling “very stressed”, up from 28% in 2003 when the study began.

Students who reported feeling confident while doing difficult schoolwork fell from 76% to 59%.” It is very difficult to learn when in a state of stress. If a child hasn’t been taught the emotional regulation skills required to create calm and a sense of flow, it is very hard to achieve success.

A child’s relationship with their teacher is fundamental to their success at school. Effective students recognise that their teachers are their allies. The importance of this relationship was borne out in the ground-breaking research of Professor John Hattie.

We tend to see this relationship as being completely in the hands of the teacher. That isn’t the case. Effective learners contribute to the creation of this strong relationship. They recognise their teachers as valuable resources whom they need to work with, in partnership.

These students are easy to recognise, they participate in class, they stay after class and ask extra questions, and they make appointments with their teachers to get help if they need it.



Finally, if a child is to achieve success in education, they need to value education. In life, we very rarely persist or strive in an endeavour if we don’t think it is valuable. Studies show that children are more likely to embrace education and succeed in homes where education is valued, where there are books and where parents are engaged in learning.

# Thinking and Learning Characteristics of Young People | PUMAS

A brief summary first: Presenting science and math concepts to Primary level and younger children is generally best done with tactile and visual approaches. By the Upper Elementary grades, most kids like to memorize "facts," and by Middle School, they tend to develop "skepticism" ...and all that this implies.

There is, of course, a wide distribution in the attributes of individual children, and of different populations of students. In addition, teachers have a broad range of strengths and preferences. So use this material only as a general guide in developing PUMAS examples.

# 16 Characteristics Of A Critical Thinking Classroom

How do you know if your students are thinking critically in the classroom? Here are examples that might be good indicators.

by Terry Heick

The premise here is straightforward: clarifying what critical thinking might ‘look like’ in the classroom. Put another way, what are some indicators that rational thought and careful, critical thinking is not just ‘visible,’ but a part of the culture of a classroom.

In Critical Thinking Is A Mindset, I offered that, “Just as math can be said to be a kind of language and science is a way of thinking, critical thinking (while also being a ‘way’ of thinking) is first a state of mind–a willingness to do so both preceded and proceeded by a motley collection of presuppositions and premises and tendencies and cognitive defaults and even eventually personality traits that manifest when you read a book or have a discussion or skim a news headline or research an idea.”

I also discussed this idea in Teaching Disruptively, when I said, “inquiry-based learning (or critical thinking) that doesn’t just encourage students to ‘discover’ some preselected poet you had in mind, but find their own reasons for reading poetry—then finding their own poets.And perhaps most of all, by creating self-directed learners that can ask the right question at the right time within the right community to affect the kind of change that lasts.”

This concept also surfaced in dozens of other things I’ve written over the years, from Characteristics Of High-Performing Classrooms to Are You Teaching Content Or Are You Teaching Thought? to Correcting The Deficit In Critical Thinking when I wondered if maybe we should, create “learning models that require critical thinking–learning models that cannot function if students (all students) don’t think critically. This would be much like a rowboat where everyone has to row and stops if someone stops rowing; alternatively, break apart the boats completely so every student must row themselves.)someone stops rowing; alternatively, break apart the boats completely so every student must row themselves.”

Which brings us to this post. How do you know if your students are ‘thinking critically’? Of course, the answer depends on a scores and scores of factors, from the grade level and content area you teach to your relationships with students and the nature of your curriculum, units, lessons, and activities. But below are some examples that, if witnessed with any consistency at all, might be a good sign that your students are thinking.

Beliefs and ‘stances’ change if/when new data emerges.

The quality of knowledge and data is more important than an intellectual ‘stance’ of personal opinion.

Claims made–by anyone from the teacher and students to the authors and experts they study–are required to withstand clinical, good faith intellectual scrutiny.

Emotions are separated from reason. That is, they are seen as effects of thoughts rather than equal to thoughts or worthy of similar scrutiny, application, validation, acclaim, etc.

Unpredictability and ‘disruption’ (of ideas, some planning, assessment forms, traditional thinking patterns, etc.)

‘Intellectual divergence’ where thinkers seek to be in the company of evidence, truth, data, and perspective and are ‘diverge’ from one another/you/authors, etc. not emotionally (though that’s okay at times) but conceptually and intellectually.

‘Truth’ is based in reason and affection rather than opinion and belief.

Learning is inquiry-driven (through curiosity and knowledge demands), not curriculum-driven.

Students ask–then improve–questions to drive lessons, projects, discussions, etc.

The language of reason is used: words and phrases that clarify and endorse uncertainty and the need for more knowledge/data, sentence stems that clarifying positions or seek to clarify others, neutral transitional statements, etc.

Literacy in fallacies and biases. That is, heuristics, cognitive biases, and logical fallacies are discussed frequently and without ‘great prompting’ and effort.

The legacy of ideas and their origin/momentum/endorsement/change over time in response to data and new thinking, etc.

Humility. (This is at the core of rational, critical thought. Humility says, ‘I’m not sure’ or ‘I don’t know enough to have an informed opinion’ or ‘Let’s gain knowledge so that we can reduce uncertainty.’)

Students ask more questions than the teacher.

Questions are valued over answers.

Questions are revisited, updated, and revised.

# Six characteristics that promote student learning (opinion)

Istock.com/mykyta dolmatov

After 40 years studying how college affects students, and after reviewing more than 7,000 studies published since 1970, a deceptively simple question still nagged: “So, what did you learn?” The answer is lots, of course, but a more precise question has also lingered: “What day-to-day, actionable nuggets are buried in that mountain of evidence to help administrators and faculty members better educate students?” This article offers some answers.

Virtually all of the 7,000-plus studies examined activities, programs or services that administrators or faculty members provide for students in academic, co-curricular or out-of-class venues with the goal of improving student learning or development. (Here, those terms include verbal and quantitative competence; cognitive development; social, civic, religious and political attitude formation; and other outcomes.) Our books actually identified too many experiences that shape those various outcomes. Something pithier, definitely briefer, was needed.

I began wondering whether those shown-to-be-effective activities, programs or services shared features that might have contributed to their effectiveness. What are the characteristics of those widely varying experiences -- residence, faculty-peer interactions, instructional approaches, co-curricular experiences and so on -- that studies consistently show are effective in shaping so many different outcomes?

Fifty years of research indicate that educationally effective student experiences:

Involve encounters with challenging ideas or people. Basically, this is Newton’s First Law of Motion in action in the academic, cognitive, psychosocial, attitudinal and career-preparation dimensions of students’ postsecondary education: a body will remain at rest, or in motion in a straight line, unless compelled to change its state or direction by an outside force. In a student’s educational life, the outside force challenging the student presents ideas, beliefs, perspectives or educational environments different from those the student holds or can accept. The outside force may also be people who differ from the student in significant ways. Whatever its nature or source -- in or beyond the classroom -- if the challenge is not so minor it is barely noticed, or so overwhelming it is quickly rejected, it opens the door to broader or deeper knowledge, to the reformation of ideas or beliefs, to the adoption of more differentiated and complex understanding.

Require students’ active engagement with the challenge. The learner must engage with the challenge, investing energy in resolving the tension between new and old that the challenge has introduced. Over the past half century of research on college effects, the most persistent finding has been that learning is not a spectator sport. As a colleague put it: “For the turtle to advance, it must first stick its neck out.” For learning to occur, students must engage the challenge meaningfully. The higher the level of engagement, the greater the educational benefit.

Occur in supportive environments. Educationally effective experiences are more likely in environments that stimulate exploration, examination, experimentation and risk-taking, where “failure” is acceptable, even expected. Supportive environments provide encouragement and appropriate guidance to help learners persist and succeed. Support mechanisms mediate the learner’s response to a challenge, channeling that response in constructive, educationally effective ways. Whatever its forms or origins, support facilitates continuation of the learning or developmental momentum a challenge has sparked.

“Support” does not, however, mean coddling students or dumbing down what is to be learned. Support provides whatever the learner needs to engage the challenge and benefit educationally from resolving the tension the challenge created. Together, a challenge and support make an educationally effective experience possible.

Encourage active, real-world learning. Socrates notwithstanding, the most common teaching approaches today still involve an instructor lecturing and group discussions, often led by teaching assistants. For the most part, students play a passive role, learning primarily through memorization and recall. Beginning in the 1990s, active pedagogies began to emerge, capitalizing on students’ interests and motivations for learning to involve them in their own and others’ learning (e.g., working in teams and learning from one another). With active learning, students often work on real-world (or simulated) problems for which no correct answer or solution exists. Experiential approaches are more effective over all and promote such skills as problem identification, critical thinking, evaluating evidence and alternative ideas, and tolerance for ambiguity.

Involve other people. Student learning and development may be a solitary activity, like reading, studying, viewing art or witnessing an event. More often, however, the challenge occurs when the student engages it with others, such as peers or mentors. Some challenges may be more cumulative than catalytic, as when students adopt (or reject) peer group or other values, attitudes and behaviors. A group may also provide support for resolving challenge-generated conflict.

Invite or promote reflection. This characteristic has drawn more theoretical than empirical attention, largely because of its multiple definitions, the heterogeneity of the forms and areas of its application, and the process it might entail. Matthew J. Mayhew and other scholars conclude, however, that providing “opportunities to reflect” is a vital, research-based characteristic of effective teaching and learning. Indeed, reflection is one of the specifications for service-learning courses, and one can reasonably argue it inheres in problem-based learning, living-learning communities, diversity experiences or assisting on a faculty member’s research project, all of which have a documented, positive effect on learning and development. The case for reflection’s centrality in learning and development, however, also rests on logical grounds: conceptual or behavioral change arguably requires consideration of what “new” means in the context of current knowledge.

A Wholly Different Perspective

Shifting one’s focus -- from the effects of specific experiences on specific outcomes to the shared characteristics of demonstrably effective experiences -- is nontrivial, whatever the experience and whatever the outcome. The shift and the characteristics described above imply a wholly different way of thinking about how to enhance the educational impact of students’ experiences. The new perspective leads to the conclusion that whatever an administrator, faculty member or organizational unit does to promote student learning or development is likely to be effective provided it has one or more of the six characteristics described, and the more the better. Conversely, if a current or proposed activity, program or policy has none of the six characteristics, that lack casts doubt on its educational effectiveness and the strength of its claims on people’s time, energy and other resources.

The change in perspective also calls into question the value of best practices -- activities, programs or policies that may work well at one institution but be poorly suited to another institution and its students. Applying the six characteristics in thinking and decision making promotes flexibility and creativity, encouraging generation of numerous, perhaps novel, alternatives for enhancing a given educational outcome. By creating new pathways to potential solutions or enhancements, the new perspective replaces canonization of another institution’s approach with new ideas likely to be better suited to the institution where they are generated by administrators, faculty and staff members who understand the local history, culture, environment, personnel and resources. Homegrown ideas are also less likely to encounter organizational resistance to change.

This different perspective, combined with the six characteristics, has broad applicability. Assuming that educating undergraduates is the primary activity of all higher education institutions, it follows that every organizational division (academic affairs, student affairs, administration, finance and business, external relations, and so forth) and the units and people within them have some measure of direct or indirect responsibility for achieving the institution’s core mission.

In the first of our two volumes of How College Affects Students (1991 and 2005), Ernie Pascarella and I suggested that educational effectiveness can be enhanced through “learning-centered management, a decision-making orientation that consistently and systematically takes into account the potential consequences of alternative courses of … action for student learning.” For institutions and individuals practicing “learning-centered management,” the six characteristics provide a framework and criteria for operational, programmatic or policy decision making in any functional area, at any level, at any time.

The global pandemic of 2020 has transformed the multiple environments in which higher education institutions everywhere must now function, and the imperatives to adapt or wither are unlikely to go away. Pedagogies, learning venues and environments of all kinds (curricular, co-curricular or beyond), as well as the support units and functions on which they depend, must be reimagined and redesigned. Meaningful preservation or improvement of current levels of effectiveness in all functional areas and at all institutional levels require fundamental rethinking and creative adaptation.

For those in higher education confronting these challenges and other immediate and future institutional needs, the framework implies questions: Which of these reimagined alternatives is more likely to ensure that students will find challenges in new ideas and people? Will engage those challenges? Will receive the support necessary for learning or development? Will be actively involved in their own learning? Will work with and learn from others? Will have opportunities to reflect on what they are learning and how they are changing?

The bottom line is straightforward: whatever we do (whether as faculty members or academic and nonacademic administrators) to promote student learning and development promises to be effective provided it has one -- preferably all -- of the six characteristics.

Students rate their educational quality highly while signaling ways to improve their academic experience in newly rel

# 9 characteristics of critical thinking

It's no secret that critical thinking is essential for growth and success. Yet many people aren't quite sure what it means — it sounds like being a critic or cynical, traits that many people want to avoid.

However, thinking critically isn't about being negative. On the contrary, effective critical thinkers possess many positive traits. Attributes like curiosity, compassion, and communication are among the top commonalities that critical thinkers share, and the good news is that we can all learn to develop these capabilities.

This article will discuss some of the principal characteristics of critical thinking and how developing these qualities can help you improve your decision-making and problem-solving skills. With a bit of self-reflection and practice, you'll be well on your way to making better decisions, solving complex problems, and achieving success across all areas of your life.

Scholarly works on critical thinking propose many ways of interpreting the concept (at least 17 in one reference!), making it challenging to pinpoint one exact definition. In general, critical thinking refers to rational, goal-directed thought through logical arguments and reasoning. We use critical thinking to objectively assess and evaluate information to form reasonable judgments.

Critical thinking has its roots in ancient Greece. The philosopher Socrates is credited with being one of the first to encourage his students to think critically about their beliefs and ideas. Socrates believed that by encouraging people to question their assumptions, they would be able to see the flaws in their reasoning and improve their thought processes.

Today, critical thinking skills are considered vital for success in academia and everyday life. One of the defining "21st-century skills," critical thinking is integral to problem-solving, decision making, and goal setting.

Critical thinking skills help us learn new information, understand complex concepts, and make better decisions. The ability to be objective and reasonable is an asset that can enhance personal and professional relationships.

The U.S. Department of Labor reports critical thinking is among the top desired skills in the workplace. The ability to develop a properly thought-out solution in a reasonable amount of time is highly valued by employers. Companies want employees who can solve problems independently and work well in a team. A desirable employee can evaluate situations critically and creatively, collaborate with others, and make sound judgments.

Critical thinking is an essential component of academic study as well. Critical thinking skills are vital to learners because they allow students to build on their prior knowledge and construct new understandings. This will enable learners to expand their knowledge and experience across various subjects.

Despite its importance, though, critical thinking is not something that we develop naturally or casually. Even though critical thinking is considered an essential learning outcome in many universities, only 45% of college students in a well-known study reported that their skills had improved after two years of classes.

Clearly, improving our ability to think critically will require some self-improvement work. As lifelong learners, we can use this opportunity for self-reflection to identify where we can improve our thinking processes.

Strong critical thinkers possess a common set of personality traits, habits, and dispositions. Being aware of these attributes and putting them into action can help us develop a strong foundation for critical thinking. These essential characteristics of critical thinking can be used as a toolkit for applying specific thinking processes to any given situation.

Curiosity is one of the most significant characteristics of critical thinking. Research has shown that a state of curiosity drives us to continually seek new information. This inquisitiveness supports critical thinking as we need to constantly expand our knowledge to make well-informed decisions.

Curiosity also facilitates critical thinking because it encourages us to question our thoughts and mental models, the filters we use to understand the world. This is essential to avoid critical thinking barriers like biases and misconceptions. Challenging our beliefs and getting curious about all sides of an issue will help us have an open mind during the critical thinking process.

Actionable Tip: Choose to be curious. When you ask “why,” you learn about things around you and clarify ambiguities. Google anything you are curious about, read new books, and play with a child. Kids have a natural curiosity that can be inspiring.

ABLE is the next-level all-in-one knowledge acquisition and productivity app for avid learners and curious minds.

Investigation is a crucial component of critical thinking, so it's important to be analytical. Analytical thinking involves breaking down complex ideas into their simplest forms. The first step when tackling a problem or making a decision is to analyze information and consider it in smaller pieces. Then, we use critical thinking by gathering additional information before getting to a judgment or solution.

Being analytical is helpful for critical thinking because it allows us to look at data in detail. When examining an issue from various perspectives, we should pay close attention to these details to arrive at a decision based on facts. Taking these steps is crucial to making good decisions.

Actionable Tip: Become aware of your daily surroundings. Examine how things work — breaking things down into steps will encourage analysis. You can also play brain and puzzle games. These provide an enjoyable way to stimulate analytical thinking.

Critical thinkers are typically introspective. Introspection is a process of examining our own thoughts and feelings. We do this as a form of metacognition, or thinking about thinking. Researchers believe that we can improve our problem-solving skills by using metacognition to analyze our reasoning processes.

Being introspective is essential to critical thinking because it helps us be self-aware. Self-awareness encourages us to acknowledge and face our own biases, prejudices, and selfish tendencies. If we know our assumptions, we can question them and suspend judgment until we have all the facts.

Actionable Tip: Start a journal. Keep track of your thoughts, feelings, and opinions throughout the day, especially when faced with difficult decisions. Look for patterns. You can avoid common thought fallacies by being aware of them.

Another characteristic of critical thinking is the ability to make inferences, which are logical conclusions based on reviewing the facts, events, and ideas available. Analyzing the available information and observing patterns and trends will help you find relationships and make informed decisions based on what is likely to happen.

The ability to distinguish assumptions from inferences is crucial to critical thinking. We decide something is true by inference because another thing is also true, but we decide something by assumption because of what we believe or think we know. While both assumptions and inferences can be valid or invalid, inferences are more rational because data support them.

Actionable Tip: Keep an eye on your choices and patterns during the day, noticing when you infer. Practice applying the Inference Equation — I observe + I already know = So now I am thinking — to help distinguish when you infer or assume.

Observation skills are also a key part of critical thinking. Observation is more than just looking — it involves arranging, combining, and classifying information through all five senses to build understanding. People with keen observation skills notice small details and catch slight changes in their surroundings.

Observation is one of the first skills we learn as children, and it is critical for problem-solving. Being observant allows us to collect more information about a situation and use that information to make better decisions and solve problems. Further, it facilitates seeing things from different perspectives and finding alternative solutions.

Actionable Tip: Limit your use of devices, and be mindful of your surroundings. Notice and name one thing for each of your five senses when you enter a new environment or even a familiar one. Being aware of what you see, hear, smell, taste, and touch allows you to fully experience the moment and it develops your ability to observe your surroundings.

Open-minded and compassionate people are good critical thinkers. Being open-minded means considering new ideas and perspectives, even if they conflict with your own. This allows you to examine different sides of an issue without immediately dismissing them. Likewise, compassionate people can empathize with others, even if they disagree. When you understand another person's point of view, you can find common ground and understanding.

Critical thinking requires an open mind when analyzing opposing arguments and compassion when listening to the perspective of others. By exploring different viewpoints and seeking to understand others' perspectives, critical thinkers can gain a more well-rounded understanding of an issue. Using this deeper understanding, we can make better decisions and solve more complex problems.

Actionable Tip: Cultivate open-mindedness and compassion by regularly exposing yourself to new ideas and views. Read books on unfamiliar topics, listen to podcasts with diverse opinions, or talk with people from different backgrounds.

The ability to assess relevance is an essential characteristic of critical thinking. Relevance is defined as being logically connected and significant to the subject. When a fact or statement is essential to a topic, it can be deemed relevant.

Relevance plays a vital role in many stages of the critical thinking process. It's especially crucial to identify the most pertinent facts before evaluating an argument. Despite being accurate and seemingly meaningful, a point may not matter much to your subject. Your criteria and standards are equally relevant, as you can't make a sound decision with irrelevant guidelines.

Actionable Tip: When you're in a conversation, pay attention to how each statement relates to what you're talking about. It's surprising how often we stray from the point with irrelevant information. Asking yourself, "How does that relate to the topic?" can help you spot unrelated issues.

Critical thinking requires willingness. Some scholars argue that the "willingness to inquire" is the most fundamental characteristic of critical thinking, which encompasses all the others. Being willing goes hand in hand with other traits, like being flexible and humble. Flexible thinkers are willing to adapt their thinking to new evidence or arguments. Those who are humble are willing to acknowledge their faults and recognize their limitations.

It's essential for critical thinking that we have an open mind and are willing to challenge the status quo. The willingness to question assumptions, consider multiple perspectives, and think outside the box allows critical thinkers to reach new and necessary conclusions.

Actionable Tip: Cultivate willingness by adopting a growth mindset. See challenges as learning opportunities. Celebrate others' accomplishments, and get curious about what led to their success.

Being a good critical thinker requires effective communication. Effective critical thinkers know that communication is imperative when solving problems. They can articulate their goals and concerns clearly while recognizing others' perspectives. Critical thinking requires people to be able to listen to each other's opinions and share their experiences respectfully to find the best solutions.

A good communicator is also an attentive and active listener. Listening actively goes beyond simply hearing what someone says. Being engaged in the discussion involves:

Actively listening is crucial for critical thinking because it helps us understand other people's perspectives.

Actionable Tip: The next time you speak with a friend, family member, or even a complete stranger, take the time to genuinely listen to what they're saying. It may surprise you how much you can learn about others — and about yourself — when you take the time to listen carefully.

The nine traits above represent just a few of the most common characteristics of critical thinking. By developing or strengthening these characteristics, you can enhance your capacity for critical thinking.

Critical thinking is essential for success in every aspect of life, from personal relationships to professional careers. By developing your critical thinking skills, you can challenge the status quo and gain a new perspective on the world around you. You can start improving your critical thinking skills today by determining which characteristics of critical thinking you need to work on and using the actionable tips to strengthen them. With practice, you can become a great critical thinker.

# Why It’s Okay to Feel Lost (And How to Find Your Way Again)



“Feeling lost, crazy and desperate belongs to a good life as much as optimism, certainty and reason.” ~Alain de Botton

Do you feel lost and alone?

Adrift and confused about which way to go?

Do you long for “something more” but have no clue what’s missing?

Maybe you’re not miserable exactly, but you’re not animated and in love with life either.

Your circumstances may even look pretty good on the outside.

But on the inside, where truth resides, you are bored to tears, unfulfilled, and restless.

Or maybe you are miserable, stuck in a painful place, silently suffering.

Trust me; I know what that feels like.

I felt lost as an introverted, highly sensitive soul struggling to conform to my environment.

I felt lost as I endured the shame of a teen pregnancy and years of pent-up grief over the adoption of my baby.

And I felt completely lost when I realized that I had spent over twenty years pursuing work that was utterly wrong for me.

For decades, I tried to just ignore the disturbing aspects of my life. I became good at distracting myself with routines and habits that brought me a sense of peace, however superficial.

Some of these habits even turned into addictions I had to overcome, but that’s another story.

With no real sense of identity or direction, I mostly did as I was told, stayed on the periphery of things, and focused on giving others what I thought they wanted from me.

Until I became so weary with my soul-crushing job and so depleted by not honoring my true nature that I felt like I’d die if I didn’t make a change.

But if I wasn’t going to do this work anymore, what was I going to do?

And how would I honor my true nature when I didn’t even know who I was or what I really wanted?

I sure have lost my way a lot in life.

It’s scary. But it’s okay. Because feeling lost can be a good thing. Let me show you why.

All feelings arise to show you something about yourself and your life.

Feeling lost doesn’t mean you’re doomed or that your life is hopeless. It simply means that something better is waiting for you.

Maybe you’ve been conducting your life based on what others believe is right, and you lost sight of what you really want.

Maybe you’ve been valuing the opinions of others over your own inner knowing.

Maybe you’ve been spending too much time with people who drag you down rather than lift you up.

These are all behaviors that, sooner or later, lead to discomfort. And they are all signs that something new and more suitable will ultimately happen.

Remember the sheer joy of discovery you experienced as a child when you learned things just because you were curious? Well, you can keep doing that as an adult, and it can be just as much fun.

Genuine curiosity—the persistent pursuit of understanding that leads to awareness and improvement—is an invitation to look into something not only with your mind but also with your heart and soul.

Asking lots of questions sparks interesting ideas and creates all kinds of connections; it opens up more options and opportunities.

Many of us have struggled to conform to our environment or life roles and lost sight of who we truly are.

Feeling lost is an opportunity to slow down the hectic busyness of your life, listen to your heart, and discover what matters most to you.

You can take time to rediscover your natural talents, the elements of your personality that have always been there. You can identify your deepest needs, values, and wishes.

The more you understand yourself, the easier you can detect what wants to happen next.

We humans have a strong need to control, fix, and influence everything.

The problem with thinking we know all the answers and trying to manage outcomes is that we end up shrinking, or getting stuck in place, rather than growing.

Feeling lost and confused isn’t meant to stop you in your tracks. It’s meant to beckon you forward along the path intended especially for you.

Venturing into this unknown territory can have an enchanting sense of possibility and freedom to it.

Life is meant to be an adventure in becoming, a blossoming into who you are meant to be. The most excellent adventure of all.

We’ve all struggled at one time or another with not knowing who we are, what we really want, or where we’re headed. Lessen your discomfort by reaching out to a friend you trust for empathy and gentle listening.

A good friend can serve as a sacred container, especially during life’s transitions. Through dialogue and honest sharing, friends can often reach a higher level of insight together.

Also remember that we belong to a larger universe that supports us and is an unwavering source of unconditional love, wisdom, and healing.

Use prayer or any other practice you enjoy to build your personal connection to your higher power. This reliable connection can stabilize you during times of uncertainty.

Meditation, deep breathing, quiet time in nature, yoga, journaling, arts, crafts, and exercise. These are all proven ways to increase well-being. Choose something that works for you, and do it every day.

Stillness and silence are especially nurturing, and you can keep it simple. Try the following short breathing exercise.

Close your eyes and focus your attention on your breath passing in and out through your nostrils. Smile as you breathe, and within a few moments, your whole body will start to relax.

Several times a day, take sixty seconds to do this. That’s all—just sixty seconds. Allow your breath to take you to your quiet, calm center.

“In the attitude of silence, the soul finds the path in a clearer light,” said Mahatma Gandhi, “and what is elusive and deceptive resolves itself into crystal clearness.”

Reawaken your curiosity, your childlike sense of wonder and openness.

The world is a fascinating place, and there are so many interesting things to learn about. Look around for inspiration and new interests.

Stretch out of your comfort zone by trying new things and meeting new people.

Use curiosity for self-understanding too. Ask yourself meaningful questions, and write about, draw, paint, or make a collage around anything that comes to you.

The following questions can get you started:

What does it mean to be a truly powerful human being?

In the words of spiritual teacher Gary Zukaz, “Authentic power is energy that is formed by the intentions of the soul. And, you are only as powerful as that for which you stand.”

So ask yourself, “What do I stand for?” And listen to your heart. You might also ask, “Who do I want to become?”

It’s okay if the answers don’t come right away. Just keep asking and listening for as long as necessary. It will be worth the wait.

Because the answers to those vital questions will reveal the very best you, the strongest, most generous you.

Remember that no matter what your circumstances or how lost you feel, you have the power to choose your direction and how to use your energy.

One fine day you will find your way from confusion to clarity.

Until then, stand tall in your unique personal power, and trust that all will be revealed to you when the timing is right.

You are moving, changing, and growing at the exact right pace.

Stay curious, and be gentle with yourself.

Your something better is right around the corner, inspiring and surprising, just waiting to be found.

What does it mean to feel lost?

7 tips for finding your way when you’re feeling lost

Focus on the journey: discovering what’s next

Everyone feels lost sometimes. 

Whether you’re in the midst of a major life transition or questioning a career pivot, feeling lost is a normal part of figuring out your next step. It’s often a sign of impending personal growth—an opportunity to accept new challenges and learn about yourself. 

It can be tricky to navigate making decisions while you’re feeling lost. Let’s take a closer look at what it’s like to feel lost and tips for taking your next step. 

Feeling lost is akin to feeling stagnant, in either your career or personal life. You recognize your current situation no longer serves you, but aren’t sure where to turn. For some individuals, it can feel similar to depression.



These are seven signs that you might be feeling lost:

You often reflect on the past.

You’re less optimistic about the future or questioning your life path.

You struggle to enjoy activities that you used to love.

You’re disinterested in how you’re spending time.

You feel unmotivated.

You feel like you’re in a rut.

You feel as though you’ve lost touch with your true self.

For most of us, feeling lost is a sign our personal values or goals have changed. Perhaps your career aspirations have shifted, so your present role no longer feels fulfilling, or you’ve recently experienced a substantial shift in your personal life that has left you feeling aimless. 

Feeling directionless can be a catalyst to explore new opportunities and grow as an individual. Look at it as a chance to rediscover your purpose and set a new intention for how you live your daily life. 

Many different kinds of live events or experiences can prompt feeling lost. Here are some common reasons, but remember you can still feel lost without having experienced a life-changing event.

Grieving a loved one

Ending a relationship

Starting a new job or making a big career transition

Missed opportunities in your professional or personal life

As we grow and evolve as people, our needs and goals change too. You may feel lost when your current life no longer aligns with your goals, values, or purpose.



Feeling lost is nothing to panic about. 

It’s important to remember that overcoming the sense of feeling lost doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a process of self-discovery filled with curiosity and patience. 

Picture yourself facing several doors, each one a new and exciting opportunity. You’re trying to determine which one to enter to bring more fulfillment to your life. 

Here are our top tips for finding your way when you feel lost. 

When you feel lost, you probably don’t spend much time reflecting on your strengths. This is exactly where you should start when setting out on your professional and personal development journey. 



To help you get started, consider brainstorming the following questions:

Where do you excel in your current role at work? 

What are your favorite parts of your day?

What empowers you?

What skills have helped you thrive?

When are you the most productive?

Make sure to include both hard and soft skills. Do you have incredible project management skills and love to collaborate with colleagues? Are you the person your friends turn to when they need advice or support? Listing your strengths can both encourage you and guide your next steps. 

If you find it useful, it could be helpful to examine your weaknesses as well. What skills would you like to improve? Keep them in mind as you seek opportunities for growth.

Our goals change as we do. It’s a normal and natural occurrence, but can understandably leave you feeling lost. Whether independently or with the support of a life coach, hold a magnifying glass up to your current goals. Ask yourself the following questions:

What are your current goals? Which of them still resonate with you, and which no longer excite you?

What do you care about right now? What passions, hobbies, and interests make you feel fulfilled?

What might it look like to incorporate these passions and interests into your daily life?

Pocket the answers to these questions. You can return to them for further reflection as you learn more about your passions. Look at your goals as things to reevaluate as you grow and change. 

Take extra care to support your body and mind. It’s taxing on your well-being to navigate unchartered territory. Go out of your way to care for yourself. Here are some healthy self-care habits to try:



Journal. If you don’t know what to write about, look up prompts online to guide your writing. A journaling practice is a great way to challenge negative self-talk and rediscover topics that excite you. 

Exercise. Move your body every day. Even going for a 20-minute walk during your lunch break counts. 

Eat the rainbow. Make sure you’re eating three meals a day with some snacks sprinkled in. Incorporate more fruit and veggies, experiment with new recipes, and discover new foods you enjoy. 

Rest. Prioritize time for genuine rest. That could mean spending an afternoon watching movies or hiking—whatever true rest looks like to you. 

Meditation or deep breathing exercises. These habits help regulate your nervous system, so you can calm your mind and feel grounded in the present moment.

Minimize social media use. Young people spend an average of 3.5 hours a day scrolling on social media. Too much time spent “doom scrolling” negatively impacts self-esteem and can contribute to feeling lost. 

Use these healthy habits to build a solid routine. Eventually they will become automatic, and sustaining beneficial activities won’t require as much effort. They can also help you stay well-equipped to handle more challenging situations. 

Trying something new activates the parts of your brain that release dopamine, a “feel good” hormone that makes us feel pleasure and excitement. Engaging in a new activity or pursuing a new interest promotes feelings of well-being.

Trying new things also boosts our brain’s neuroplasticity, its ability to change and be rewired. By putting yourself in new situations, your brain forms new neural connections. Neuroplasticity happens in response to learning new things, and is associated with improved cognitive functioning over the long term. 

Harvard Medical School recommends finding new activities that are challenging and fairly complex. Make sure you set aside dedicated time to practice these new activities. 

While making huge changes all at once might feel like the most productive way to reach a new goal, it’s not the most sustainable. You learn more about yourself and your interests by gradually chipping away at your new goals. Slow, small steps are huge leaps in the long term. 

If you try approaching an objective one way and it doesn’t resonate, you can pivot and try another route. Use each step forward as a chance to better understand what to do next. 

Feeling lost is a unique opportunity to set out on a new path. A professional coach or mentor can shed some light on what you should do next. Support like this can also help you handle complex emotions as they arise. 

Talk with someone you trust and who could view your situation from a new perspective. For example, if it’s time for a career change, seek the support of a career coach who can provide guidance.  

How would you speak to a friend if they were in your position? Odds are, you would tell them to be kind to themselves, create space for rest, and appreciate the process of learning about their new goals. Treat yourself as you would a close friend—be kind and patient. 

When you find yourself feeling anxious or impatient, take a step back and look at the situation objectively. Focus on making progress instead of performing every step perfectly. Keep an open mind, so you’re enabled to learn as you go. 

Feeling lost is an opportunity to explore a new part of yourself and perhaps pursue a new goal. You shouldn’t expect immediate results. Instead, focus on learning from the journey that comes from finding your way.

Take care as you explore your next steps and remember: you’re not alone. Working with a coach can provide guidance on how to rediscover your values and goals.

# Rediscovering Yourself When You Feel Lost and Uninterested With Life

I’ve been so lost lately. For a few months actually. I haven’t known where I’ve wanted to live, what I want to do with my time, or even what I want to do for work. I’ve felt unfulfilled to say the least. I’m the freest I’ve ever been in my life, but I’d also agree I’m the most unfulfilled and lost. I feel stuck in the biggest rut, moving from one place and one thing to another as soon as that doesn't feel right, or lead to happiness. It might sound extreme, but I now feel like I'm having an identity crisis. 

I’ve read every single article over the past month on finding and getting to know yourself. It sounds crazy because you’re supposed to know yourself better than anyone else, right? But I don’t think I know myself at all. Not really. Even when I think I do, it’s probably who I was a few years ago, not now. 

Because of that, I’ve decided to embark on a real journey of self-discovery. I’m fed up with feeling fed up and although I don’t know what I want in life, I do know that I never want to feel this way again. It’s been the lowest point, and something I’ve wanted to shake but haven’t been able to despite trying. 

Something has to change.

Read on for 6 things to remember when you’re feeling lost and uninterested with life, as well as reasons for a self-discovery journey.

Even calling this a self-discovery journey is so woo-woo that it feels ridiculous. But it’s the only thing I’ve never really tried: truly getting to know myself that is. I never want to blame my past for anything, but there were quite a lot of big transitions and life changes over the past three years that I’ve never fully addressed. I’ve always distracted myself and poured positive energy into creating or writing, instead of facing what I needed to, fearing it would lead me into a negative spiral I’d never get out of. 

But now I’m on this journey of doing everything I can to rediscover my passions, dig deep to understand what I want from life and start loving my life again. I’m dedicating a year to myself in the hopes that by the end of it, I’ll feel very different to the way I do now. 

I’ve thought about whether to share this, but you can almost guarantee that the minute I go quiet on here it’s because of personal things I’m dealing with. This blog started as a way of sharing my hardest times, but somehow along the way I've replaced it with the belief that I’m supposed to have it all together by now. As a result, I go quiet when it’s not the case. Like now.

I also know this process will be long and hard, with a lot of tears, patience and new things I need to try. I want to share a little more of that, for those of you that also feel the same; that horrible feeling that you're uninspired and lost but not sure what to do about it.

 It won’t be an overnight fix, I know that. But something about sharing this journey I’m on also gives me motivation to actually do the things I know I need to do to feel better. And it can be exciting too, to think of the possibilities that will come from that. 

If you’re like me and have read almost every article on the topic of getting yourself out of a rut, you’ll notice the obvious things cropping up, those being:

Journaling always helped me through dark times before, but over time I've got out of the habit of it. I'm certain that part of feeling disconnected and lost is because of it's absence. Bringing back the daily practice is my first step. 

Daily journal prompts:

There are questions I’ll be asking myself each day during it, noting down the answers to:

 There are a few other things I’ve made an effort to do, such as:

 

Try out new hobbies to find things you enjoy. Enrol in new classes, meetup events or solo travel in the hopes that something will eventually bring joy through one of them! 

Volunteer your time for perspective. Helping others stops us overthinking about our own lives and forces us to gain empathy for someone else instead.

Dig deep and redefine goals. What do you want from life? Where do you see yourself in 5 or 10 years?

Identify your strengths and weaknesses. What things are you good at? What are you uniquely skilled at? What activities get you in a state of flow?

  

All feelings are. And even though we know it, we still make decisions that can sometimes be permanent. Instead, I’m making an effort to remind myself daily that this feeling is only a result of something happening in my life right now. These situations make us feel sad, frustrated or low… right now. They are only temporary. 

Most of us think that we’ll do something when we feel motivated. But the opposite is true. Taking action is what drives motivation, making us more motivated to do something. Get started and do something, right now, no matter how small. 

This is hard to do when you’re lacking motivation and feeling lost. After all, that lost feeling comes from not having goals or an idea of what you want in life. The way I’m combatting this is to set myself short-term goals. Goals that don’t need much concentration or effort but will make me feel better in the short-term. Hopefully the more we focus on the little things, the more chance we have of discovering the bigger goals that drive us.

Trying new things is hopeful. It gives you the chance to expand yourself and your goals. It might also lead to new opportunities that you haven't previously thought of. Some of those things you will love, others you won’t. But allow this bit to excite you.

Like I mentioned before, this feeling won’t last forever, but I understand that doesn’t help when you’re in the thick of these emotions. Have the courage to find a therapist and talk to someone, even if you only try it for a few weeks. Exploring ourselves on a deeper level is sometimes helped with someone there guiding you to open up and notice parts of you that you’ve suppressed.  

Ask yourself; ‘what would I do now if I felt motivated? How would I dress? What would I eat?’ The simple question of asking myself what I would do if I felt motivated right now, took me from working from home in my lounge wear, not doing a lot, to getting dressed, taking a walk and getting a lovely coffee from a local cafe. It was small but when I returned home I was in a different state of mind. 

 

Can you resonate with any of the above? If you feel the same, I hope these little starters help you to gain a little motivation. Do something small that makes you smile right now and seek the courage to make a change too. 

This article is a game-changer for anyone feeling lost or disconnected. It offers practical, actionable steps to rediscover yourself and reignite your passion for life. The advice on self-reflection, trying new experiences, and setting goals is spot-on. I especially appreciate the emphasis on self-compassion and patience. This is a must-read for anyone seeking to reconnect with their true self and find renewed purpose.

I appreciate this perspective and the vulnerability to talk about being lost.

I think this article is Very Inspiring, and I find the steps you’ve described to be a Motivational process I Excitedly want to try.

Not only do I usually feel lost and uninspired in life – Especially after serving 23 years in prison, and being psychologically evaluated and deemed to have Anxiety, Severe, Major Depression, and PTSD due to my past life and actions – but I have Absolutely No idea as to How on Earth I’m going to Get out of this Undesirable, Self Created reality and Do Something Fantastic with My Self and My Life.

Your Informative, well written article is an Attractive perspective and Amazing Opportunity I am curious to put into action just to see if it’ll bring me a positive, beneficial effect.

# Let’s Talk About… Feeling Lost – Let’s Talk About Mental Health

Let’s Talk About Mental Health

The weekly podcast that makes mental health simple

Why do we feel lost sometimes? How do you find a sense of direction? And what can you do to make life feel more meaningful? 

That’s what I’m talking about this week here on… Let’s Talk About Mental Health — the weekly podcast that helps you improve your mental health, with simple ideas you can put into practice immediately. So, get comfortable, and Let’s Talk About Mental Health…

Versión en español | Versão em português

This podcast episode was originally released on 30 April, 2023.

Hello and welcome to Episode 177, and thanks so much for joining me as I talk about feeling lost and mental health!

I’m Jeremy Godwin and I share practical tips for improving your mental health based on quality research and my own personal experience of learning how to live with anxiety and depression following a breakdown in late 2011 that completely changed my life. Each week I look at how to improve one specific aspect of your wellbeing. 

In this episode I’ll be talking about what feeling lost means, why dealing with those feelings matters, and how to overcome feeling lost in life. So, let’s talk about feeling lost!

Introduction

A few years ago I found myself feeling completely lost for the second time in a decade — actually, the third, now I think about it — and it ended up changing my life for the better. But it took time. Let me explain. 

My first big ‘feeling lost’ period happened in 2010, when I found myself questioning why I was sticking with an employer who didn’t support me while I was dealing with a major issue at work, even though I’d been there for 9 years at the time. I didn’t know what I wanted to do, other than the fact that I knew I had to get out of that place, and that led me to jump at the first job opportunity that came my way… which ended up making my stress and anxiety much worse, because the job was very high-pressure and the company was so disorganised and erratic that it made it tough to get anything done, and so that ended up as one of several factors that led to my breakdown. 

Then my second ‘feeling lost’ period actually dragged on from 2012 to 2014, after I eventually quit that job because my mental health was so bad, but for most of that period I was severely depressed and highly medicated, so I definitely felt lost but I didn’t have a lot of time to think about what I wanted to do with my life because, well, frankly, I didn’t know that I wanted a life at that time. 

So then my third, and most significant, period of feeling lost came in 2018. I had graduated from university and now I had to decide what to do with myself… and I had absolutely no idea. Zero. I was going to keep on studying counselling but I struggled with the emotional side of it (funnily enough, that’s what I do now, working one-on-one with clients, but I’m in a much better headspace than I was back then). Anyway, then I actually enrolled into study again to become a primary school teacher, but that lasted two weeks when I realised that I just wasn’t going to have the patience necessary to deal with a bunch of kids and that I’d probably end up telling them off and traumatising them for life; I decided long ago not to repeat the damaged patterns of my own parents, which is why I don’t have children, so I thought it would be irresponsible to wind up doing that to someone else’s kids as a job (a choice that I wish some of my own childhood teachers had have made, because I had some really nasty ones!).

So here I was, about to turn 42 at the time, and still with no idea what I wanted to be when I grew up. What a mess! I ended up returning to the familiarity of the business world, and you may be aware that that little experiment didn’t end up lasting too long (I lasted just over a year), because it just wasn’t right for me either, but it’s the thing that led me to creating my podcast and to working for myself as a counsellor/coach, so it ended up being a very-necessary step on my path towards finding purpose and direction in my life.

Here’s the thing: often we can find ourselves feeling lost in life because we just don’t know where we’re heading, and why, and yet it’s the not knowing that actually presents a unique and exciting opportunity… because if you don’t have any preconceived ideas, that means you’re much more open to all of the possibilities that life has to offer you! I’ll talk about this idea in more detail shortly, but first let’s get ourselves on the same page with some definitions and let’s talk about…

What ‘feeling lost’ means

The idea of ‘feeling lost’ is a way to describe when someone feels unsure, mixed-up, or kind of overwhelmed by what’s happening in their life, their emotions, or their thoughts. It can show up in different ways like not knowing what steps to take next, not having a clear purpose, feeling disconnected from themselves or others, or having trouble making choices. 

You can feel lost in different parts of your life, such as in your relationships, at work, in terms of your personal growth, or just your overall path in life. 

Feeling lost is a common experience for a lot of people and it’s something that can happen as a result of different life events like dealing with major life changes, the ending of a relationship, the loss of a job, or having a general sense of dissatisfaction about where you’re at in your life in the present (especially if you had a very specific idea of where you wanted to be or thought you should be). It can often be accompanied by a lack of purpose or direction, a feeling like what you’re doing with yourself doesn’t have a lot of meaning, or general feelings of isolation or loneliness. 

The good news is that feeling lost is a temporary state, and so — with time, effort and perseverance — you can absolutely rediscover your sense of self and find happiness and meaning in your life again. 

It’s important to remember, however, that feeling lost is not a sign that something is wrong with you or that you’re a failure; feeling lost is a perfectly normal human emotion, and a lot of people go through it at various times in their lives. The key to dealing with it is figuring out what’s causing the feeling and dealing with that, as well as talking to friends, family, or even a mental health professional in order to get through the feeling, because it can be demoralising and demotivating.

As you may have noticed from the introduction earlier, I’m a bit of an optimist about the notion of feeling lost (well, a realistic optimist anyway), in the sense that I know from firsthand experience how unpleasant it can feel however I also know that it’s a wonderful opportunity to try new things and discover all of the possibilities that life has to offer; it can either feel like you’re wandering around with no idea what to do with yourself, or it can be a way of giving yourself permission to take your time and figure out what you might want to do with yourself… either way, the choice is yours (and it’s the choice you make that determines whether it’s an unpleasant experience or a much more pleasant one!). 

So now let’s talk about… 

Why dealing with those feelings matters

And it matters because (to state the obvious) feeling like you have no sense of purpose or direction in your life is very likely going to make you feel like complete and utter rubbish! There’s no way around this other than to say that feeling lost can be one of those ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’ things if you’re not careful, in the sense that you may feel a bit lost and then feeling that way can drag you slowly down into a pit of despair that makes you feel more and more lost, unless you deal with the reasons why you feel that way and put in the work to help yourself move forward.  

The thing is that feelings of being lost in life can have a significant impact on your mental health and overall wellbeing, and so it needs to be confronted and dealt with head-on; it’s very unlikely to magically fix itself, and honestly I don’t think it’s worth the risk to just wait and hope that things can only get better (and yes, I did just quote the 1993 song by British group D:Ream, because that’s what I do… you’re welcome!).

Back to the more serious conversation at hand… feeling lost can lead to a lack of motivation and direction which, over time, can lead to issues like anxiety, depression and hopelessness, along with general malaise and melancholy (or, if you’re a bit ‘emo’, an overwhelming desire to dress in black and sigh a lot while listening to The Cure). 

So, if you feel a bit lost (or a lot lost) and you want to be able to find a way forward, it’s about dealing with the reasons why you feel lost in the first place to then start looking at what your options are to move forward and create a sense of purpose, direction and fulfilment in your life.

How do you do that? Well that is a very good question, and coincidentally it just happens to be what I’m going to talk about next in the how-to part of today’s episode! So, let’s talk about… 

How to overcome feeling lost in life

And I’m going to start with one that will probably feel quite tough, and maybe even confronting, which is to acknowledge and accept the feeling of being lost — and I say that this one might be difficult because I think, for a lot of us, we put pressure on ourselves to focus on the positive all or most of the time, and so it can be genuinely confronting and uncomfortable to accept the fact that we feel anything less than the very best version of ourselves… but earlier I mentioned ‘realistic optimism’ (something I covered in Episode 47 about optimism) and the thing is that we all go through tough times every now and then (that’s the ‘realism’ part), and we are all completely capable of getting ourselves out of those tough times as well (which is the ‘optimism’ part). I’m going to sound like a cheesy bumper sticker or Instagram post here, but you have already survived 100% of your worst days so far in your life… so, whatever you’re going through now, you will survive this as well. But in order to heal, you first need to feel. So, be honest with yourself about what you’re feeling and why, and accept things as they are while also recognising that you have the ability to improve things (and I’ll tell you how to do that in a moment); you might find it helpful to write your feelings out, as it’s a great way to release your emotions, and just remember that emotions are better out than in! OK, next… 

Identify why you may feel lost — and this is all about self-awareness, which just so happens to be the foundation of all that is good and lovely when it comes to your wellbeing… because when you know yourself — really know yourself — you can make smarter choices for yourself based on who you are, who you are not, and what you actually need and want. So, to figure out why you might be feeling a bit lost it requires you to be honest with yourself about what’s going on in your life and what areas you might not be happy with. For example, take some time to think about recent changes in your life (such as the end of a relationship, a change of job, family issues, etc.) and how those changes might be impacting on your sense of purpose or direction. Think about what’s important to you in life and whether or not you’re living in alignment with your values and priorities. Reflect on your past experiences, both positive and negative, and consider how they might potentially be influencing your current state of mind. Think about the relationships in your life — family, friends, partner if you have one — and consider whether any of your relationships might be contributing to your feelings of being lost or disconnected. And then also pay attention to your emotions generally; take note of when you feel most lost or uncertain and what emotions you feel during those times, because that can provide you with quite a lot of insight into the underlying factors contributing to the feeling of being lost. The entire point of this exercise is to ask you to take some time to really think things through so that you can better know yourself, and so that you can really get your head around what you’re feeling and why (because, in the words of the ancient philosopher Socrates, “the unexamined life is not worth living”). I mentioned identifying your values before and I covered that in Episode 138, plus I talked about needs in Episode 137. Once you have a clearer picture of why you might be feeling a bit lost (or a lot), then move onto my next point which is… 

Create a plan — now you know what needs to be addressed, it’s time to start thinking about what you could possibly do about it! Depending on what your issues and challenges are, you’ll be able to find lots of different things that you could potentially do. For example, if the issue is boredom and feeling like you’re not being challenged, then maybe learning new skills would be a good way to overcome that… which then begs the question of what new skills?! So that would mean taking time to think about what interests you, as well as what your strengths are, so you can figure out ways to build your capability and knowledge (and I covered learning and capability in Episode 144). If the issue you’re dealing with is to do with your work, then the plan might be focused on finding a new job or maybe even changing career fields entirely. If you’re dealing with relationship issues, then maybe it’s about going to counselling or therapy with the other person (if they agree) to work through things together. If you feel lost because everything just feels a bit same-same, then you might want to focus on exploring your personal interests, trying new experiences, making time for self-care, getting out into nature, improving your self-compassion (which I explored in Episode 153) and more. Whatever the issues are, focus on them one by one and create a list of ideas for how you can tackle the issue, then pick a couple of things from that list that you feel positive and enthusiastic about and make a clear plan of what you’re going to do, when you’ll do it, and how you’ll know if it’s helping you make progress (and I talked about progress in Episode 161). OK, so once you have a plan then the next step is… 

Take action — because we can talk about the idea of doing all these things as much as we like, but it’s only by actually taking action and making things happen that you’re going to see any real results… so it’s time to do something about it! Allocate a little time every day to working on the issues that need to be addressed (and I encourage you to try at least a couple of things, for two reasons: it makes it more interesting if you mix it up, and it gives you a greater chance of success in case one of the things doesn’t pan out the way you might have hoped or expected). You don’t have to try and fix everything all at once; take things one day at a time and one step at a time, and remember that small steps add up over time to enormous progress (plus by not trying to rush yourself to quickly fix things, you actually are more likely of being successful in the long run because slowly changing things is more sustainable as it allows you to build and build over time). I also talked about this stuff recently in Episode 172 about feeling stuck, so you may find that helpful as well. 

OK, so that’s a more step-by-step process for you to consider, now I’m going to give you a bunch of general ideas of how to overcome that lost feeling; have a think about which ones might feel right for you and maybe give a couple a go, then try another couple later, and so on and so forth. OK, first…

Be creative — because engaging in creative activities like writing, painting, playing music, or other creative things can help you to explore your emotions and also gain greater awareness and insight into your inner self. Next… 

Connect with nature — want to feel part of something bigger? Then get outside and be part of something bigger! There is more nature than you can shake a stick at, and spending time doing things outdoors, like hiking or gardening, can help you to feel more grounded and more connected to the world around you. Next… 

Connect with your spirituality — which, again, is about feeling part of something bigger than just yourself because that can help you to find a sense of meaning and purpose; it doesn’t need to have anything to do with religion, but of course it can if that’s what feels right to you, and please bear in mind that ‘spirituality’ and ‘religion’ are two very different things (‘spirituality’ is about focusing on more than just the material and physical world, whereas ‘religion’ is about a specific belief system of faith and worship). OK, next… 

Practice mindfulness — because any kind of mindfulness practice, like meditation or yoga, can help you become more present and focused, which can help you to feel less anxious. I’ve said in many past episodes that I keep this really simple and just spend a few minutes a day with a coffee or tea, watching the clouds pass by; it’s a simple-yet-effective way to anchor myself in the present moment (plus I just happen to be really fascinated by the sky, day or night!). Next…

Change your environment — because sometimes a change of scenery can be exactly the type of change to help you gain perspective on other things in your life and find a new sense of direction. It’s why I go and work from a cafe every now and then, and it’s also why I like to go and spend a day at a museum or gallery sometimes to mix things up and get me out of my day-to-day. You could think about taking a trip somewhere, or if you’re feeling really adventurous then maybe you might want to look into moving to a new city or country; either way, experiencing new cultures and perspectives can broaden your horizons and provide new insights into your own life. OK, next…

Seek out role models or mentors — because finding someone who has been through a similar experience can be really helpful in gaining new insights and perspectives. Next… 

Read books or listen to podcasts — I mean, hey, it’s what you’re doing by listening to me now! Learning from others who have gone through a similar experience can be a source of inspiration and guidance, or maybe you just want to find new ideas for personal growth or perspectives that you hadn’t considered before. Next… 

Move your body — because exercise can help you feel more energised, reduce stress, and increase your sense of wellbeing. If you really want to have fun with it, you could move your body to Move That Body by 90’s band Technotronic, followed by Pump Up The Jam while using jam jars as hand weights, for the ultimate in exercise with a side-dish of meta! That’s a very specific, niche joke that I know I’ve made in an earlier episode and I enjoyed it so much that I’m recycling it here today and adding to it, because I believe in doing my bit for the environment and for reviving the career of obscure 90’s bands. [Laughs] I swear these jokes get dumber every week… you’re welcome! OK, so, moving on… 

Try new things — because just doing the same thing over and over again isn’t going to change anything, it is?! Try a new hobby, maybe join clubs or groups that align with your interests, volunteer your time and contribute to a cause you feel passionate about, try networking with industry groups or attend special interest events; there are lots of different things you can try and I’m sure you’ll find at least a few things that you might never have considered but which help you to feel stimulated and excited about new things. OK, next… 

Talk with a professional — if you’re struggling with persistent feelings of being lost or if you’re experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety, consider seeking help from a mental health professional; it’s one of those things that might feel really tough to talk about, but the more you talk about it the easier it gets over time. I can tell you from my own personal experience that it’s the best thing I ever did, and it played a huge role in helping me to get myself out of that ‘feeling lost’ headspace.

Summary and Close-Out

Because when it comes to feeling lost and mental health, what it all boils down to is this: Life can be a journey full of twists and turns and, at times, it’s easy to feel lost and uncertain about your direction. But remember that feeling lost sometimes is a normal part of life. It’s important to acknowledge those feelings and seek support from others while also focusing on looking after yourself, setting goals, and exploring new experiences. The good news is that feeling lost is actually an opportunity for personal growth and self-discovery; with time, effort, and perseverance, you can find your sense of purpose and direction in life. Keep moving forward, be patient and compassionate with yourself, and trust the journey. You are capable of finding your way and creating a fulfilling and meaningful life for yourself.

The choice is yours, as it is with all things related to your wellbeing… so, what choice will YOU make today? 

Each week I like to finish up by sharing a quote about the week’s topic, and I encourage you to take a few moments to really reflect on it and consider what it means to you. This week’s quote is by an unknown author, and it is:

“Feeling lost is part of the way.”

Alright… that’s nearly it for this week.

Next week I’ll be talking about closure. We all have to deal with issues and difficult times in life, whether that’s with relationships breaking down or being in challenging situations that leave us wondering what the hell just happened. The struggle tends to be afterwards, when we try to figure out how to move forward and keep on hitting walls because we haven’t been able to find any kind of closure or understanding about whatever happened or didn’t happen… and so that’s what I’m going to be talking about next week. I’ll be talking about what closure is (and what it isn’t), why closure isn’t guaranteed, and how to find closure for yourself.

# JUST WALK AWAY: The Unbearable Types of Men to Avoid Dating

unhuppy couple

The heart may want it, but at times we should pay more attention to our brains. Dating is a learning curve.. Finding Mr. Right does not come easy for everyone

A man can be sweet, good-looking, and wealthy, but he may still have some fatal flaw that is a total deal breaker. It may not even present itself right away, but in time, it will emerge. And let me give you a little piece of advice: you cannot change him. Don’t even try.

Remember this will lead to marriage which is a lifetime commitment you all know. If they have some major defect you can’t live with – walk away.

At first he’ll be charming and treat you like a princess. You’ll soon find out however that you are not the only woman in his life.

Their mother/son bond borders on unhealthy. They phone each other daily. She still cooks his dinners, does his laundry, and makes sure he’s visited by the “Money Fairy” from time to time.

He goes to her for advice on all things. It’s the mother to make a final decision in all matters happening in her son’s life including deciding on who he should date. She still refers to him by his childhood nickname – Buju Buju, Teddy bear, or whatever other idiotic name it might be that makes you barf in your mouth a little.

You will forever be compared to her, will never quite live up, and will always come second.

This is the guy whose smartphone is another addiction. It is never out of reach. It’s either in his pocket or on the table next to him.

He suffers from serious FOMO (fear of missing out) and cannot go five minutes without looking at it. In fact, when you’re on a date, his phone makes you feel like a third wheel.

Whether he’s updating his Instagram, checking soccer scores, WhatsApp with friends,  making a TikTok, or catching up on his X (Twitter), you will forever be competing with his phone time.

I think it goes with a saying that “those of us with children” place them very highly on our priority lists.

However, My-Kids-Are-My-Life Guy will do nothing without his little dears. He doesn’t believe in babysitters. He thinks if you have someone else care for your children, you may as well not have had them in the first place.

Therefore, You’ll get no quality time and you will never be a priority, your dates with this type of guy will consist of trips to the zoo with his children, children’s birthday parties, Or even NO dates at all. He will choose the kids over you.

He may seem nice at first, and he’ll still have his moments, but dating a passive-aggressive will not go well.

He doesn’t like confrontation, therefore won’t express himself when he has an opinion or is angry or upset. If you’re lucky, he’ll write you a note.

If he doesn’t give any opinion, he can blame you for everything that doesn’t work out. And he won’t bring it up right away, he’ll hold onto that little grudge to use as punishment later.

This type of man to avoid will always be the victim, so you’ll never win an argument with him. When he does finally express himself, it’s like a volcano eruption.

This type of man goes nowhere fast.

He probably has big dreams but is a notorious non-finisher of things, – university, the startup of a business, that book he’s writing, the chicken project, etc. More than likely he’s unemployed, a good-for-nothing, and may live with friends or at his parent’s house

Instead of looking for gainful employment, he’s smoking weed, playing video games, and endlessly watching TikTok or YouTube videos. He never wants to go out and doesn’t have the money to do so if he did. He is the epitome of “arrested development.”

The term madonna-whore complex was devised by Sigmund Freud and is the distinction men draw between the women they desire and the women they respect – and the two are mutually exclusive.

In this type of man’s eyes, you are either virtuous or you are a slut.

Essentially, this guy will have sex with you, but he will never marry you.

Because even though he wanted to, and even if he’s a man-whore, once you agree to knock boots with him, he will see you as a prostitute.

This guy is like a vampire. His constant complaints, criticism and judgments will drain you. He is a people watcher, constantly waiting for someone to make a mistake.

It doesn’t matter what it is, they could be wearing white pants after Labor Day, eating salad with their dinner fork, or failing to respond to his whatsApp message.

This type of guy to avoid needs to find something on which to base his entire negative opinion.

It will only be a matter of time before he labels you based on one of your little faults. “I didn’t know you had a tattoo. You must be a wild one.”  “That type of job, am sure you will not cook food for me.”   

It could be something to that effect, or it could be increasingly ruder. Don’t wait to find out, my dear RUN!!!!!!

He’s smart, funny, good looking, and seems extremely confident. Arrogance is often mistaken for confidence. In fact, a confident man would not do or think the things Mr. Arrogant does.

He thinks he’s better than you.

In fact, he’s better than everyone. His best friend is the guy in the mirror. He has no true friends, just superficial colleagues. He’s a know-it-all that demeans people to their faces and makes jokes at their expense. He also has to make up every story you tell because, well, he’s better than you.

The control freak man may be a career professional who seems like he’s got it all together. His house is probably spotless.

However, won’t take too long before his true colors bleed through the smokescreen.

He will probably clean up after you, maybe sighing or muttering under his breath as he does. If you move something, he will move it back to its “proper” place.

He keeps a routine and doesn’t like monkey wrenches thrown in, so no spontaneous dates or birthday surprise,

He’s probably the jealous type, so he wants to know where you are and what you’re doing at all times.

He wants access to your text messages, email and social media accounts.

He will criticize your for your imperfections and twists. He is moody, *especially* when he feels he’s not in control.

His tailored power suit may be the first thing you notice about the workaholic and of course the well-polished good looks.

But, similar to a social media man you will be in a constant three-way – with his phone. And you can forget about ever making plans in advance. They will either be forgotten or rescheduled.

When he actually does have a free night the last thing this type of man will want to do is go out. He’s going to need to be productive in some other way. He’ll want to visit the village, work on some other project he’s been wanting the time to do.

His drive to was probably instilled at a young age by parents who wanted perfection.

At home, he will either be a control freak or at the complete other end of the spectrum, not wanting to make a single decision because that’s what he does all day.

More than likely, all your conversations will be about his work.

He’ll probably have you thinking, how can this guy be unattached?

He’s cute, fun, smart, personality plus. He doesn’t have kids. The next thing you should ask yourself is, why is this type of man single? He’ll be crazy for you too – at first, no doubt about it.

Your relationship with the eternal bachelor will be electric and adventurous. You’ll go listen to live music, he’ll cook for you. He’ll pay for everything. He has cool hobbies.

You may even hear the words, “I love you” come out of his mouth. You’ll seriously start thinking he’s the one.

Hold that thought.

Just when things are going great, he starts having doubts.

He starts remembering why he’s single. He likes the time to work on his cool hobbies, meets the guys.  He’s realizing he’s spending money on you and less on his hobbies.

All of a sudden you have stuff at his house, shampoo, a toothbrush, a few of your clothes. You’re around more than you’re not and he feels like he can’t breathe. And then he’s not that into you anymore and breaks up with you.

But hey, look, these type of men to avoid do not comprise every guy on the face of the planet.

There are some out there who are normal and loveable…ish. But keep this in mind; nobody is perfect.

Don’t mistake these destructive personality traits for twists with which you could live.

This is my mantra when it comes to dating: Life is short. Don’t waste it with people who make you miserable.

So… if you come across one of these, it’s time to move on. Girlfriend just RUN and don’t look back.

# 60+ Red Flags in Men You NEED to Know (before it's too late)

 

If you’re dating, you’ll need to know what to spot before diving deep. Whether you’re online, young, or old, here’s a list of red flags to look for in men.

If you’re dating, you’ll need to know what to spot before diving deep. Whether you’re online, young, or old, here’s a list of red flags to look for in men.

Read more 




The stats are in—and they’re not great. Pew Research Center1https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/08/20/nearly-half-of-u-s-adults-say-dating-has-gotten-harder-for-most-people-in-the-last-10-years/ found that 67% of daters say their dating life is going “not too/not at all well.”

Yikes!

In this guide, we’re going to dive into the dating red flags you should spot to avoid going down a long, embarrassing road in the future.

A dating red flag is a warning sign that appears during a date or interaction with a romantic interest that could indicate a future problem, miscommunication, or challenge.. Examples of dating red flags are talking only about themselves, avoiding difficult conversations, gossiping about their ex, and withholding affection.

Dating red flags can reveal themselves both physically and verbally, and can be dangerous if not spotted early.

Red flags in the early stages of dating can be subtle or obvious. If a red flag appears more than once, it’s important to take note before the relationship goes too far, says dating coach Blaine Anderson. 

We cover a ton of dating red flags in this blog post, but if you want the TL;DR version, here it is:

To talk about some specific red flags I sat down with Blaine Anderson, online dating coach and Instagram dating influencer. Watch our interview below to learn how to identify attachment styles, hot/cold dynamics, conversational hogging, and more!



Want the full list of red flags to look out for? Check these out:

Ah, our guy is a walking, talking IMDb page of love sagas past. Just one date in, and he’s already recounting tales of his various exes—complete with dramatic pauses, flashbacks, and maybe even a theme song if you’re “lucky.”

And just like how you don’t want to binge-watch a soap opera that’s been canceled for poor ratings, you might not want to invest in a guy who’s basically a spin-off of his own failed relationships.

What He Says: “You wouldn’t believe the drama with my ex. She was totally psycho.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I may or may not have contributed to that drama, but I’d rather paint myself as the eternal victim here. Ready for the next episode?”

Sure, financial responsibility is important, but if someone is making you feel bad for spending money, and is counting your pennies on the first date, that’s a warning sign. When he calculates his every expense down to the cent, you may wonder if he’s equally cautious about investing in an emotional connection.

What He Says: “Wow you ordered so much food. I’m not paying for your extra.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m not willing to invest much in this relationship.”

He flirts like it’s a sport. With you, with the waitress, with basically anyone in a five-mile radius. At first, it might seem like harmless, outgoing behavior, but it’s confusing to understand who’s special to him if everyone is on the receiving end of his charm.

What He Says: “Wow, you look as beautiful as our server tonight!”

What He’s Really Saying: “My attention easily diverts; you’re not the only special one here.”

Picture this: You meet a guy who seems to have been chiseled from the gods of perfection. He’s charming, he’s engaging, and he’s agreeable—maybe too agreeable.

Every word from his mouth is what you want to hear. Whether it’s about politics, cuisine, or your favorite movies, it’s like dating your own echo chamber. But remember, nobody is this perfect. His flawless facade may be concealing not just personality flaws but perhaps an entire secret life.

Is he a spy? Is he married? In the Witness Protection Program? Okay, maybe not, but he’s definitely hiding something.

What He Says: “I can’t believe how compatible we are; we agree on everything!”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m curating myself to be your dream guy, but the real me is still hidden.”

This guy has more drama in his life than a soap opera and he’s always, without fail, the innocent victim. From crazy exes to unscrupulous bosses, from backstabbing friends to, heck, even the barista who supposedly has a vendetta against him—the world is out to get him.

What He Says: “You won’t believe what happened to me today; it’s like the universe is against me.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m the center of my own world, and I expect you to orbit around me, too.”

This guy has a vault of praises, and sorry darling, you don’t have the access code.

Withholding compliments, especially at critical moments when you deserve recognition, is a form of emotional frugality that you just don’t need in your life. Imagine celebrating your career milestones with a guy whose enthusiasm levels are on par with a sloth’s heartbeat.

What He Says: “Cool. Anyways, are we ordering in tonight?”

What He’s Really Saying: “Your accomplishments are just speed bumps on the road to my next meal.”

Ah, Captain Vague, the man who treats plans like they’re part of a top-secret mission—details to be revealed only on a need-to-know basis. Is he a mysterious spy or just someone who can’t commit to dinner and a movie?

What He Says: “Let’s hang out soon. I’ll hit you up.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m keeping my options open, and you’re one of them. Don’t wait up.”

Ah, the Man-splainer, the guy who thinks he’s the unofficial professor of literally everything—including your own job.

What He Says: “Actually, in your field, it’s important to consider XYZ…”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m so smart, I even know your job better than you do. Aren’t you impressed?”

If he’s got more photos of himself than he has of friends, family, or anything meaningful, consider this a red flag. Mr. Me-Me-Me tends to steer every conversation back to his favorite subject: himself.

What He Says: “Enough about you, let’s talk about me.”

What He’s Really Saying: “Your stories are just speed bumps on my monologue highway.”

You know the one—the guy who is allergic to anything that even hints at long-term. From avoiding labels like “boyfriend” to going MIA when you mention a future event you’d love to attend together, this guy is adept at dodging anything that ties him down.

Sometimes he’ll try to make it about “living in the moment” or “keeping things spontaneous,” but the reality is that he’s not in it for the long haul. Beware, your emotional investment is likely to yield zero return here.

What He Says: “Let’s just see where things go, no need to label it.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m not committed to this relationship, so don’t get too attached.”

Ah, this guy. He’s always in the mood to share his problems, fears, and past traumas, and expects you to be an always-on therapist.

While emotional openness is crucial in any relationship, with this one, it’s a one-way street. He’s quick to drain your emotional resources, but good luck getting the same level of emotional support in return.

Being there for each other is one thing; becoming a psychological sponge for his issues is another.

What He Says: “I need your help with every one of my problems (real or not).”

What He’s Really Saying: “Prepare to be my emotional landfill.”

This guy loves to nitpick. At first, you might think he’s just keen on self-improvement, but soon enough you realize he’s keen on improving you—or rather, molding you into his image of what you should be.

Be wary; a partner should appreciate you for who you are, not for who they want you to be.

What He Says: “You’d look even better if you wore your hair like this. And while we’re at it you should get some new shoes.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I want to mold you into my ideal partner.”

Just when you think things are going well, he vanishes. Messages go unread, and your calls join the ranks of the Bermuda Triangle—never to be heard from again.

What He Says: “Sorry, I’ve been swamped.”

What He’s Really Saying: “You’re my backup option, so I only text when my first choice falls through.”

This guy loves attention so much he could give Broadway divas a run for their money. From Instagram selfies to interrupting conversations to sing his own praises, it’s always about him.

What He Says: “Again, I had the craziest day; you wouldn’t believe what happened to me.”

What He’s Really Saying: “It’s all about me, and it always will be.”

He holds you to the highest of expectations but fails to meet even the most basic ones himself. If you’re five minutes late, it’s an issue. But if he keeps you waiting? Well, you should be honored he even showed up.

What He Says: “You’re late. Time management is important, you know?”

What He’s Really Saying: “Rules are for you, not for me.”

This gentleman can’t stop talking about his glory days. Whether it’s his high school football career, the killer parties he used to throw, or the innumerable “good times,” he’s stuck in a time warp.

Every other sentence is a trip down memory lane, making you wonder if he’s even capable of making new memories.

Or worse, if his best days are truly behind him, where does that leave you? Sure, nostalgia is fun, but you also want a partner who’s excited about the future.

What He Says: “You should have seen me back in the day; I was the man!”

What He’s Really Saying: “I peaked in high school, and I’ve been living off those memories ever since.”

The grass is always greener, and this guy is perpetually over the fence and into someone else’s yard. Committed to being uncommitted, Mr. FOMO can’t stick with plans or people for too long.

What He Says: “Let’s keep it casual for now.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m holding out for someone I think is better, but I don’t want to be alone in the meantime.”

He talks a big game about emotional intelligence, but when it comes to practice, he’s as sensitive as a rock. Sharing feelings with him is like talking to a wall—ineffective and emotionally draining.

What He Says: “You’re being too emotional.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m uncomfortable with feelings, so let’s make this about you being wrong.”

He’s eloquent over text but clams up in person. If he can write you a sonnet but can’t carry a conversation, you’re essentially dating his phone.

What He Says: “I’m just not a big talker.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m brave behind the screen, but don’t expect that courage to transfer into real life.”

Is it just you, or does this guy flip-flop more than a pair of summer sandals?

One moment he’s sweet, attentive, and into you; the next he’s aloof, distant, and barely there. He showers you with compliments one day and gives you the cold shoulder the next.

It’s emotional whiplash, to say the least. The rollercoaster is exciting at first, but eventually, it’s just nauseating. If you stay with him, make sure to fasten your seatbelt because it’s going to be a bumpy ride.

What He Says: “You mean so much to me. I’ve just been really busy lately.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I want to keep you on your toes, and not in a fun way.”

This one’s got you in his life, but barely. One moment he’s into you and the next, he’s gone—no texts, no calls, and then he appears again out of the blue, as if nothing happened.

Leaving you on ‘read’ is practically his hobby. But remember, emotional availability is not optional, it’s necessary. And this Houdini act? It’s a major red flag.

What He Says: “Sorry, I was swamped. What’s up?”

What He’s Really Saying: “You’re my option, not a priority.”

He has three jobs, seven hobbies, and is learning his fifth language. While his accomplishments are impressive, you’ll soon realize you’re not on his to-do list. And he never asks about your accomplishments.

What He Says: “I’m just really busy right now.”

What He’s Really Saying: “You’re not a priority, and probably never will be.”

He’s the kind of guy who thinks it’s cool to be disinterested. Somehow he’s convinced himself that not caring is a personality trait.

What He Says: “I mean, does anything really matter?”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m too cool to care, which means I’m too cool for a relationship.”

He loves to debate—about anything and everything. His need to constantly prove his intellectual prowess can turn simple conversations into intense debates.

The problem? He often forgets a relationship is not a debate club. He challenges every opinion or statement you have, not because he’s genuinely interested in a constructive conversation, but because he wants to win. You’ll quickly find that this can be draining in a relationship.

What He Says: “Ah, but have you considered the existential implications of that?”

What He’s Really Saying: “I enjoy arguing more than I enjoy agreeing with you, even on trivial matters.”

Sure, loving your mom is a good thing, but when his decision-making revolves around her opinion, you might want to reconsider. It’s sweet that he seeks her advice, but not when it’s about how he should cut his steak or what movie you two should watch.

Your relationship should be about two adults, not an adult and his mom.

What He Says: “My mom doesn’t like that place.”

What He’s Really Saying: “If Mom doesn’t approve, it’s a no-go for me.”

No matter what you’ve accomplished, he’s done it better, faster, and in seven different countries. Not only has he run a marathon, he did it while juggling.

A word to the wise: if you’re looking for a cheerleader, you won’t find it here—you’ll only find competition.

What He Says: “Oh, you’ve been to France? That’s cute. I lived there for a year.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m in constant competition with myself, even with you.”

He’s so mysterious, he’d give Sherlock Holmes a headache. If he can’t be clear about basic details, what else is he hiding?

Vagueness can be alluring up to a point, but when it comes to meaningful connection, you’ll want more substance than shadow.

What He Says: “I don’t like to put labels on things, including myself.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I don’t want to be accountable. And if you get to know me too well, you’ll probably be disappointed.”

While you’re talking about your day or sharing something personal, he’s busy scanning the room—or worse, checking out other people. It’s like he’s always shopping around, even when he’s with you.

Don’t be surprised if you find him still active on dating apps. This guy struggles to stay focused on what’s in front of him and clearly hasn’t learned that ‘the grass is greener where you water it.’

What He Says: “Yeah, I’m listening. Go on.”

What He’s Really Saying: “You’re my option, not my priority.”

Here’s the guy who never stops talking about his assets—literally.

Whether it’s his brand new sports car, the “killer” investment he just made, or name-dropping his “very important” friends, he’s always keen to remind you how successful and well-connected he is. But if he’s all about the Benjamins, will he ever value you?

What He Says: “You wouldn’t believe the deal I closed today. It made my 6 figure bank account go to 7 figures.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I need my possessions and accomplishments to speak for me because my personality can’t.”

The world is always against him and he’s not shy about sharing his woes. His perpetual gloom and doom can be emotionally draining, leaving you feeling like a therapist rather than a partner. While it’s important to support each other in a relationship, this guy turns it into a one-man pity party.

What He Says: “It’s just that life never gives me a break, you know?”

What He’s Really Saying: “I take no responsibility for my circumstances; it’s easier to complain.”

Online dating can be tough—the laggy video calls, lack of physical touch, and awkward random internet outages can all make dating awkward. But it can go deeper than that. Can you really trust the person on the other end of the line? Spot these online dating red flags to help you stay safe:

This guy’s profile is too good to be true—professional photos, a job that sounds like it was ripped from a Forbes article, and a bio so smooth it could sell ice to Eskimos. The only catch? He avoids video calls like the plague and dodges questions about his whereabouts. Chances are, you might be swimming with a catfish.

What He Says: “Sorry, my camera is broken. Can’t video call.”

What He’s Really Saying: “You’ll be sorely disappointed when you find out who I really am.”

You’re texting, and oh boy, is he talkative! Paragraphs that go on like a Dickens novel, diving deep into the complexities of his day and asking about yours.

Then suddenly—radio silence. Days go by with not even an emoji. Just when you’ve reconciled with the idea that he’s joined the Ghost Brigade, he magically reappears.

His excuse? An emergency board meeting with Elon Musk, a volcanic eruption in his backyard, or maybe he was abducted by aliens. Whatever it is, the storyline is worthy of an Emmy.

What He Says: “Sorry I’ve been MIA, work has been crazy!”

What He’s Really Saying: “You’re my backup plan for when I’m bored.”

He’s up for endless chats and seems genuinely interested—over text. But when it comes to setting an actual date? Suddenly he’s busier than a world leader at a summit. If he’s not eager to move things from the virtual world to the real one, something’s fishy.

What He Says: “Let’s play it by ear. My schedule is kind of crazy.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m not serious about taking this further.”

When you scroll through his profile, it seems like he’s traveled to every country, tried every sport, and even rescued a kitten from a burning building.

As dreamy as it sounds, if his life reads like an adventure novel, he might be stretching the truth a little—or a lot.

What He Says: “Just back from my third Everest summit.”

What He’s Really Saying: “My stories are grander than my commitment to reality.”

He looks like he stepped right out of a Calvin Klein ad—in 2011. Wait a minute, why do all his profile photos have timestamps from the early 2010s?

If your would-be Romeo is recycling pictures from a bygone era, he’s misleading you before the first message is even sent.

Worse yet, it throws trust out the window before you’ve even had the chance to open it. And ladies, trust is a window you want open, or at least ajar, when stepping into a new relationship.

What He Says: “Photos? Oh, I look the same.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I peaked in 2011, and I’m not ready to accept it.”

A great relationship is possible at this stage in life when you know yourself and what you want—but be aware, there are red flags when dating in your 50s. 

Ah, the allure of the mature gentleman. He’s sophisticated, he opens doors, he remembers the heyday of vinyl records.

But beware—his dating history spans decades, which means he’s had plenty of time to master the art of manipulation.

When dating in the golden years, time is precious. If he still refuses to introduce you to his friends or even his pet parrot, Edgar, after several dates, he might be keeping you as a hidden chapter in his long life story.

What He Says: “I like to keep my private life, well, private.”

What He’s Really Saying: “You’re not important enough to meet the people (or pets) important to me.”

You’re both seasoned citizens of the dating world, but he keeps pointing out your age difference—even if it’s just a few years. While a little teasing can be playful, consistently making you feel like a spring chicken or an old relic is dismissive and disrespectful.

If you feel like your age is all he sees, it’s time to find someone who appreciates you for you, not the year you were born.

What He Says: “When I was your age, things were different.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I use age to create a power imbalance.”

He lives in a fancy apartment, drives a late-model car, and treats every date like it’s a five-star experience. Sounds great, right? But when you start to hear hints that he’s not financially secure—credit card declined, mysterious “business ventures” that are always just about to take off—it’s worth questioning if he’s putting up a front.

Financial stability isn’t everything, but transparency and honesty are.

What He Says: “My investments are just about to pay off; you’ll see.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m living beyond my means and want you to think I’m more successful than I am.”

He’s charming, he’s cultured, and he’s been single for a very, very long time. If you’re looking for a committed relationship, tread carefully. This man has avoided long-term partnerships for decades, and there might be a reason why he’s still singing the ‘Single and Loving It’ anthem after all these years.

What He Says: “I’ve just never found the ‘right one,’ you know?”

What He’s Really Saying: “Commitment scares me more than the thought of another Y2K bug.”

He’s got more pills in his medicine cabinet than a pharmacy, but he’s vague or dismissive when you ask if everything’s okay.

Health issues are sensitive, especially as we age, but a lack of transparency can lead to serious concerns down the line. If he’s unwilling to share anything about his frequent doctor’s visits or his assortment of daily pills, you’re not just dating him; you’re dating a big question mark.

What He Says: “Oh, these pills? Just for some minor issues, nothing to worry about.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m not ready to be open about my health, which could impact our relationship significantly.”

Next up: dating after divorce. A divorced person might feel free, happy, and like the best version of themselves. Unfortunately, you may meet someone newly single who’s the exact opposite. 

The process of divorce can determine what baggage a person carries into a new relationship. So if you’re dating a divorced man and these red flags appear, think twice.

What are some red flags for dating widowers? Let’s take a closer look.

Dating a widower? Be careful to not unwittingly get trapped in one of these red flag scenarios:

He says he’s separated, but those divorce papers are nowhere in sight. It might be tempting to think he’s all but divorced, but without the ink drying on those legal papers, you’re in for a murky future.

Who wants to date a man who’s still technically married? It can mean messy financial and emotional ties that could yank you into drama central.

What He Says: “We’re basically divorced, just some paperwork left.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m emotionally and legally still attached to my previous life.”

His ex is the root of all evil—or so he claims. While no one’s saying his ex is a saint, a man who lays all blame on his ex is a red flag waving in the wind.

What He Says: “She ruined me; I did nothing wrong.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I don’t take responsibility for my actions, so get ready for that.”

He’s got kids, but you wouldn’t know it. He either skirts around the topic or mentions them so rarely you wonder if they’re imaginary.

This behavior may indicate that he’s not fully present in either of his two worlds—fatherhood and dating you.

What He Says: “Yeah, my kids are around.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m keeping my worlds apart, and that includes you.”

He was back on the dating scene faster than you can say “divorce papers.” While that might feel flattering at first—wow, he’s already over his ex!—this could actually be a massive red flag.

What He Says: “I knew it was over long before it was over, so I’m ready to move on.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I haven’t fully processed my last relationship, and I might be using you to do that.”

The unfortunate truth is we’re all capable of narcissism as a form of self-preservation, but when you’re dating a genuine narcissist, red flags get particularly intolerable.

Ah, the classic narcissist move—adoring his own reflection more than anything else in the room. He seems utterly infatuated with himself, always finding ways to bring the conversation back to—you guessed it—him. Ever heard of a two-way street, buddy?

What He Says: “Enough about you; let’s talk about me.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m the sun in this universe, and you should orbit around me.”

Listen up, because this one’s as slippery as they come. With this guy, nothing’s ever his fault. If your date night fails or if there’s a disagreement, guess who’s taking the blame? Not him.

What He Says: “You’re overreacting. Calm down.”

What He’s Really Saying: “Your feelings are irrelevant, only mine matter.”

While the occasional selfie is expected, maybe even fun, this guy takes it to a whole new level. Instagram stories, reels, posts—his life is a never-ending photo shoot.

Not for your own sake, of course, but for the likes and the follows. If he’s angling the phone for the perfect selfie while you’re sharing something important, you might as well be dating his Instagram account, not him.

What He Says: “Let’s take a selfie! Gotta update my followers on how great my life is.”

What He’s Really Saying: “You’re a great accessory for my online persona.”

Apologizing? That’s like asking him to recite Shakespeare backward.

And the concept of compromise? Well, that’s merely a fleeting figment of the imagination. When you’re dating this wonder, get ready for an ego so colossal it could rival Everest.

What He Says: “I don’t need to apologize; you should understand where I’m coming from.”

What He’s Really Saying: “My perspective stands as the ultimate truth. Yours, on the other hand, is but a pebble in the vast ocean of my opinions.”

Truth be told, a lot of these red flags can be spotted if you pick up on the silent nonverbal cues that reveal a person’s inner emotions. Want to know how?

Control and leverage the tiny signals you’re sending – from your stance and facial expressions to your word choice and vocal tone – to improve your personal and professional relationships.

In a world where swiping right is the new hello, dating can be a minefield for Millennials and Gen Z. Here are some red flags specifically tailored to these tech-savvy, socially-conscious generations.

Ever chatted with someone who seems to communicate more in emojis than in actual words? While a picture may be worth a thousand words, an emoji isn’t. If your conversation is a sea of smileys, hearts, and thumbs-ups with little substantial dialogue, it could indicate a lack of depth or an inability to express themselves effectively.

What He Says: 😍🔥🌹

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m not great with words, so I let my emojis do the talking.”

This one has scrolled through your Instagram so thoroughly, he mentions your family vacation from 2016 on the first date. A little social media research is normal, but knowing your dog’s name from three years ago? That’s a red flag.

What He Says: “I saw you went to Bali in 2016. Looked fun!”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’ve gone deep into your social media history.”

He’s all about showing his social justice credentials online, but in person, his actions don’t match up. It’s great to care about important issues, but beware of those who use them as a tool to impress rather than a platform for actual change.

What He Says: “I’m really passionate about climate change and social issues.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I talk the talk online, but don’t really walk the walk in real life.”

His life goal is to hit 10K followers and get that coveted blue checkmark. While ambition is great, if his self-worth is tied to social media stats, it could lead to a relationship where you feel like you’re just another ‘like’ and ‘share.’

What He Says: “Could you take a photo of me for my Insta?”

What He’s Really Saying: “Social media validation is more important to me than our actual interaction.”

Ready to cancel anyone at a moment’s notice, this guy can be hard to keep up with. He’s quick to judge and unforgiving, often leaving you walking on eggshells.

What He Says: “I can’t believe you haven’t heard about that controversy.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m quick to judge and might not be very forgiving.”

He’s on every dating app known to humankind but never seems to commit to an actual date. A chronic swiper, he’s more in love with the idea of options than the concept of a real relationship.

What He Says: “Yeah, I’m on all the dating apps. Just keeping my options open.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m addicted to swiping, but not ready for a real connection.”

This one is a bit more subtle. He likes all your posts, maybe even some from years back, but never makes a move or starts a conversation. It’s like he’s there, but not quite there.

What He Says: *Silently likes your post from 2018*

What He’s Really Saying: “I’m interested, but not enough to actually do something about it.”

Sure, memes are the language of the internet, but if he can’t make a point without referencing a meme, it might signal a lack of original thought or an inability to engage in serious conversation.

What He Says: *Sends a meme in response to a question about his day*

What He’s Really Saying: “I struggle to express myself without the help of internet humor.”

While it’s healthy to have differing opinions, if he’s constantly challenging widely accepted scientific facts, especially those concerning climate change or other critical issues, it could be a red flag for someone who enjoys being contrarian for the sake of it.

What He Says: “I’m not sure I believe all this climate hype.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I like to challenge popular opinions, even at the expense of ignoring facts.”

He takes everything so seriously that it’s impossible to have a light conversation. While being informed and sensitive to issues is important, an inability to relax or take a joke can make for a tense dating experience.

What He Says: “I don’t find that kind of humor funny or appropriate.”

What He’s Really Saying: “I have a hard time loosening up and enjoying lighter moments.”

These red flags are tailored to the unique dating experiences of Millennials and Gen Z, who navigate a digital world of love. Remember, while some of these might be deal breakers, others could just be points for conversation. The key is to find someone whose values align with yours and who respects you as an individual, both online and off.

Reading about red flags is one thing. But when celebs reveal their red-flag dates3https://people.com/celebrity/celebrities-worst-dates/, it’s like a lousy rom-com that’s never worth watching again.

Those are embarrassing examples shared by celebrities, but they clearly show that red flags happen to everyone, and it’s not selfish or wrong to know yourself and put your needs first.

# 20 Things You Should Never Tolerate In A Relationship

Relationships

They invalidate you, for one.

You’ve probably heard the saying “love is blind.” And it can be true — sometimes romance makes it hard to see the signs that you’re in a bad relationship. Of course, no couple is perfect, but understanding which behaviors are major red flags of something unhealthy can help you find a fulfilling partnership, whether or not that’s with your current SO.

Deal-breaking behaviors can range from not being prioritized by your partner and feeling unlike yourself around them to physical, emotional, psychological, or sexual abuse. And when it comes to abusive and toxic relationships, it’s important to seek help from those you are close to, says sexologist Jess O’Reilly, Ph.D. “If there’s anyone you can reach out to, let them know you want support,” she tells Bustle. “You are not a burden.” If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic abuse, call 911 or the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or visit thehotline.org. 

That said, it’s not necessarily just abuse that can constitute an unhealthy relationship dynamic — there are a variety of concerning patterns to watch out for, some of which might be subtle and at times difficult to recognize. It can sometimes be hard to know when things are getting to a place that calls for major attention, beyond just everyday issues you can work to resolve as a couple. But no matter your situation, there are plenty of relationship problems that you shouldn’t tolerate no matter what. Below, experts explain 20 things you shouldn’t put up with in your partnership.

Perhaps your partner tries to control what you do and when you do it. Or maybe they expect you to fall in line with their values, no questions asked. There are many ways your partner can be controlling, and these behaviors are not OK, says O’Reilly. “They want you to feel what they feel when they are experiencing something — they expect you to experience the same reaction,” she tells Bustle. “That person could be harmful or toxic to your lifestyle or safety.”

Of course, you and your partner’s lives, plans, and needs will intertwine to some extent. For example, if you and your SO share a child and they ask you to check in regularly for co-parenting purposes, that’s reasonable, says O’Reilly. But if they always need to know where you are and who you’re with for no apparent reason, that’s a red flag.

Gaslight is a 1944 mystery movie starring Ingrid Bergman as a newlywed. In the film, Bergman's husband is looking for hidden treasure in their house with the help of the attic’s gaslights, which causes every other light in the house to dim. When Bergman’s character addresses the issue, her husband insists she’s imagining things. From this film, the term “gaslighter” was born to describe a partner who tries to convince you that you are wrong or irrational.

Gaslighting is a common trait in controlling partners, says licensed counselor Nawal Alomari, LCPC. Your partner may try to convince you that your concerns are “ridiculous” or unfounded, or they might respond to your hurt feelings with, “it was just a joke,” or “lighten up.” 

“When you feel something, they try and make you feel as though something’s wrong with you for feeling it,” O’Reilly says. “You’ve told them that [something] doesn’t feel good for you, and they’ve dismissed your remarks.” Although the self-doubt that gaslighting sows can be difficult to overcome, this behavior is toxic and reason enough to leave your relationship.

Controlling behavior can sometimes transition into an abusive relationship, which O’Reilly says can take the form of emotional or verbal abuse. Your partner may disparage you, make fun of you around other people, or gaslight you when you try to express how they make you feel. All of these behaviors are unacceptable, says O’Reilly. If your partner is treating you this way, she recommends speaking with a therapist or counselor to help you cope with the abuse and safely exit the relationship.

Another form of intimate partner violence is physical abuse, which O’Reilly says is absolutely grounds to leave your relationship. If your partner resorts to violence or hurts you in any way, she says to connect with a trusted loved one or professional to help you safely remove yourself from the situation. 

Marital rape, or the raping of one’s spouse, wasn’t illegal in every US state until 1993. The majority of state criminal codes contained a “marital rape exemption,” essentially declaring rape between spouses to be impossible. As RAINN explains, these laws represented the ideology “that only stranger rape constituted ‘real rape’ or that forced sex is a ‘wifely duty.’” Although the crime is now recognized by law like other forms of sexual assault, it still occurs, is often not reported, and rapists are often not convicted. Our culture already makes it difficult for survivors to recognize and report rape, so it becomes even more difficult to understand your romantic partner as a rapist.

That’s why it’s important to recognize that partner or marital rape can happen in otherwise non-violent relationships, and to remember that consenting to a sexual act once does not mean consenting to that act for all time. If your partner pressures you to engage in unwanted sexual activities because it is your “duty” or because you “owe” them, the relationship is abusive, unhealthy, and unsafe. If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, you can call the National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673) or visit hotline.rainn.org.

Your partner should bring out the best in you, says O’Reilly, so if you feel like the worst version of yourself around them, that’s a sign something’s not right. If your partner says or does things that make you feel like you shouldn’t be proud of yourself or confident in who you are, then they aren’t treating you with the respect you deserve.

A good litmus test: If your friends and family express concern over your partner’s behavior, then this likely isn’t the relationship for you, says O’Reilly.

If your partner tries to control who you spend time with, that’s a red flag, says O’Reilly. Independence is a crucial part of any healthy relationship, so attempting to isolate you from your loved ones and hobbies is a sign that your partner is trying to assert their dominance at the expense of your happiness, personal relationships, and self-care, adds Alomari. 

There are many explanations for why they behave this way, and all of them are bad. Your partner may know that your friends dislike the relationship for good reasons, and thus attempt to keep you away from people who will point out serious flaws and concerns. Or they may be insecure or jealous of your interactions with other people. But your personal relationships and lifestyle matter, so any partner who tries to take that away is not the one for you, says Alomari.

Isolating you from friends isn’t the only red flag when it comes to controlling behavior, says Alomari. If your partner forces you to abandon your hobbies, certain personality traits, or other important aspects of your life, that’s also unacceptable. “If they make you feel like you have to give up the things that make you you, that’s a no,” she tells Bustle. “Someone who loves you for real will support your relationships and hobbies, and they will push you to feed that part of yourself because they want to see you happy.”

Ever notice that you tense up when your partner is around? That’s another sign that the way they treat you puts you on edge, which O’Reilly says is no basis for a relationship. “The body responds to distress very instinctively,” she tells Bustle. “Check in with your body to see if it’s conscious of when they walk into the room.” If your body is indeed responding to your SO with stress, that’s a sign their behavior doesn’t make you feel at ease, which is grounds for a conversation or split.

Like gaslighting, you should not tolerate a partner that tries to convince you that important parts of your history or lived experiences are insignificant or untrue. One example: If a woman expresses anger about the catcalling she frequently faces on the way to work, and her male partner brushes it off as “not a big deal,” telling her to “consider it a compliment,” that’s not OK. Similarly, O’Reilly says a partner who berates you for being too uptight or not open enough is not treating you appropriately.

It’s possible to educate your partner about issues that their race or gender may allow them to avoid, and it’s possible for them to learn to understand your experiences. However, if there’s no communication, you can rightfully become frustrated and irritated when they minimize your experiences. 

Feeling judged by your partner is another sure sign that they’re not giving you the respect and kindness required in a relationship, says O’Reilly. While a loving partner can gently and respectfully help you be the best version of yourself and vice versa, a partner who is constantly telling you what’s wrong with you is a no-go. They may regularly berate aspects of your personality or body shame you — both of which are cruel, immature, and manipulative ways to exert control in a relationship.  

If your partner ignores your sexual needs or pressures you to partake in sexual activity without your willing and renewed consent, that’s not OK, says O’Reilly. While having different turn-ons and libido from your partner is normal, overstepping your sexual boundaries or ignoring your needs is not. “Sexual compatibility is not a matter of sameness, but a matter of effort,” she previously told Bustle. “If one or both of you seems unwilling to try to cultivate compatibility, it may be time to reconsider your commitment to the relationship.”

Does your partner joke about traumatic things that aren’t funny? Do they talk about their exes in a way that makes you uneasy? Or share your private information with others despite your protest? These are just a few ways that someone can overstep your boundaries, and a sign that your partner isn’t respecting your criteria for emotional wellbeing, says O’Reilly. Especially if you’ve set boundaries with your partner before and they still don’t respect them, that’s toxic behavior you definitely should not tolerate. 

If you and your partner have mutually decided to enter a committed relationship, then it shouldn't be a secret (unless, of course, there are reasons you two have consensually chosen to keep it under wraps). If you’re spending time on this relationship, then you deserve recognition. Does your partner consider you a placeholder and doesn’t want to appear tied down in case someone else comes along? Are they lying about monogamy to multiple partners and have to keep it secret? Are they embarrassed by the relationship? 

No matter the reason, you should be with someone who respects you and is proud of you. Clinical psychologist Dr. Joshua Klapow, Ph.D., says to talk with your partner to get to the bottom of this dynamic. “The real test here is how well the two of you communicate about these issues,” he previously told Bustle.  “It may be a great chance to understand more how they feel about you and address some miscommunications. You may not like the answer, but you will know where you stand.”

If your partner constantly accuses you of cheating — despite the fact that you haven’t and there is no cause for suspicion — then something is wrong. If certain aspects of your relationships with the people around you make your partner uncomfortable, then you should absolutely listen to their concerns and evaluate how your behavior may be hurtful. But if your partner is acting on insecurity alone and attempting to shame you or isolate you from others as a result, that’s a deal-breaker. 

This paranoia can happen for all sorts of reasons, from trust issues to having cheated themselves, and it’s important to get to the bottom of it in order to move forward. “Projection is a very low-level coping skill,” Dr. Paul DePompo, Psy.D., ABPP, a clinical psychologist and author of The Other Woman's Affair, previously told Bustle. “People that do things themselves like cheat, think about cheating, or have cheated in the past, project these thoughts of desire onto their partners. Their mind ends up creating a reality that their partner is cheating as well.”

Communication is a cornerstone of any healthy relationship. If your partner frequently talks over you, interrupts you, or corrects you — even if it’s not malicious — you need to point it out to them to nip it in the bud. “We’ve all heard when someone says something wrong, but constantly correcting your partner can become annoying and belittling,” matchmaking and dating expert Stef Safran previously told Bustle.

Does your current partner get angry about your sexual history or number of past sexual partners? Do they call you a “slut” or “whore” if your outfit shows “too much skin”? Slut-shaming is your partner’s way of asserting control over your body, and it can be damaging, according to Dr. Nikki Goldstein, Ph.D., sexologist and author of Single But Dating. 

“It impacts women because they might be acting on their own sexual desires or exploring their sense of self and are told by using that word that they are bad for doing so," she previously told Bustle. "They are experiencing something possibly positive and beautiful and then made to feel guilty for it. It can be very damaging to women and also very conflicting.”

It’s impossible to have a healthy relationship with someone who doesn’t want to see you succeed. It’s one thing for your partner to provide constructive criticism or to express frustration if your career is causing you to ignore the relationship, says Alomari. But if they insult your work ethic, mock your achievements, or even convince you to turn down opportunities, then you need to either confront the issue or walk away from the relationship.

Another example of destructive behavior you shouldn’t have to deal with in a healthy relationship is when your partner refuses to take responsibility or own up to their mistakes. "A relationship is toxic when an individual is unable to accept responsibility at any time, compared to a rough patch, where they accept responsibility sometimes,” clinical psychologist and relationship expert Dr. Danielle Forshee previously told Bustle. If you see no improvement in their ability to express regret or be apologetic, you likely never will — and you should never have to put up with that.

Even in healthy relationships, there are times when one person is going to hurt the other — be it on accident, on purpose, in the heat of an argument, or with a snide remark. However, a good partner will know when they hurt you (either they figure it out or you tell them), apologize, and change their behavior for the better. Anything less shouldn’t be tolerated. "The truest and biggest sign of a toxic relationship is showing no remorse for hurting your partner,” licensed psychotherapist and relationship expert Dr. Dori Gatter, Psy.D., LCPC, previously told Bustle. “The second biggest sign is showing remorse but not changing the behavior or working to change the behavior that is damaging.”

Overall, red flags can be either glaring or subtle. And while every relationship takes work and compromise — on both sides — some problems that are so toxic that you simply shouldn’t tolerate them. Recognizing which issues veer into the toxic side of things can be hard, but knowing about what to look out for ahead of time, as well as checking in with people you trust, can be helpful in the long run.

# Does Your Partner Drive You Nuts? The Passive Aggressive Personality - Couples Institute

Asking your mate to empty the dishwasher should theoretically be totally devoid of drama or tension. It's just one of many chores necessary to keep your home functioning–right?

However, with a passive aggressive personality, any situation has the potential to go from the trivial to emotional combat.

It started with the simple question from my wife, Ellyn, “Pete did you empty the dishwasher?”

I didn't respond but begrudgingly left the History Channel and headed for the kitchen, knowing I had agreed to do it before now.

Click here for a FREE report on Passive-Aggressive Behavior!I hadn't put more than three coffee cups into the cupboard when Ellyn informed me I wasn't unloading the dishwasher properly.

“Oh, really just what do you suggest?” said I, packing 100 pounds of sarcasm into that question without a shred of genuine curiosity.

Ellyn – seemingly stunningly oblivious – responded as though I had some interest in learning a better way. “Empty the bottom rack first so dishes don't get dripped on when you empty the top rack.”

I fired the second salvo of sarcasm when thanking her for the lessons on dishwasher liberation.

Many times Ellyn has gotten mad at me for not following through with an agreement. This was the real problem for Ellyn and the dishwasher. After I'd blown numerous promises, she would understandably get tense in her voice and face while expressing her frustration.

OK, so far this is pretty normal stuff for most marriages. But I could take it to new heights. I would criticize Ellyn for the way she got mad at me. I'd change the topic. The problem became her unreasonable way of expressing disappointment instead of my broken agreement.

Doing this tricky psychological maneuver took absolutely no effort, thinking or planning on my part. Just pure instinct. The implication was that if she would just change the way she expressed her frustration the problem would be solved. Better yet, if she just had more patience, I would eventually get around to getting it done.

Poor Ellyn, she was doomed if she got angry and doomed if she said nothing. Welcome to the crazy world of the passive aggressive partner.

Although I wasn't a full fledged, card carrying passive aggressive personality, I had the qualifications to be an honorary member of the club.

Want more help? Check out our audio workshop on passive aggressive partners.

Here's a big secret about this problem. Passive aggressive behavior is a very difficult challenge for couples. The passive aggressive person is a pain to live with and very hard to change.

Here's why. Passive-aggressive people are typically hypersensitive to actual or perceived criticism.  Especially when they don't follow through with promises. Here's the kicker. They have great gobs of good reasons for not following through with crucial agreements.

For example, I could blame my failure to complete agreements on ADD. Or I might say that I suffer from a condition of temporary and intermittent cognitive slippage (which is only a devious description of being lazy and forgetful).

This is a problem that affects both partners, but in different ways. The passive aggressive person generally feels they are under assault and no matter what they do, they cannot please their partner. “Jeez, I can't even empty the dishwasher right!”

The other partner believes they cannot depend on the passive aggressive mate to reliably follow through. Even if I am 80% reliable, as I would sometimes point out to Ellyn, she has no idea what the 80% will be or when it will be completed. This screws up the logistical part of being an effective team which supports being an effective couple.

So what causes this aggravating problem that painfully affects both partners in different ways? Most passive aggressive folks have two things in common:

1. A highly critical parent or parents, resulting in a high sensitivity to being judged on performance.

2. A lot of painful disappointments in life. This results in a reflexive coping mechanism that severely restricts their hopes and desires in life. Minimizing desires is a subconscious attempt to avoid getting hopes up and then dashed which triggers a warehouse of painful disappointments stored in the emotional brain.

It becomes much easier for passive aggressive people to say what they don't want than what they do want.

It's like running life's race with your shoelaces tied. But the frustration of living a life of pinched desires leaks out in being “obstructionistic” – to their spouse, therapist, boss, and anyone else that might have a say, or at least a suggestion, about what they should do.

“I don't like anyone telling me what to do, including myself,” said Bill, who has a passive aggressive personality. This is not an easy mind-set for a spouse to live with.

All in all nobody is happy.

Passive aggressive behavior can show up in other subtle ways. Hard core passive aggressive people rarely initiate doing leisure joint activities, buying things, going places, celebrating special occasions, planning surprises, or giving compliments, and they often have a hard time buying gifts.

So what can you do? This is a complex question with no easy answer. The solutions to this problem are extremely hard to summarize with the clarity and brevity required for a newsletter column. Next month I'll describe why passive aggressive behavior is a systemic problem and what both partners need to do. In the meantime, it should be some small comfort to understand some of the challenges and to recognize what you're dealing with.

Nicely done enriches my mind with more ability to deal with all the day to day dificulty i face

Thank you for this article. I have been having problems with my spouse over similar things mentioned in your writing (tiny things that start a full blown fight, leaving both of us hurting, angry, and one of us sleeping on the couch). I felt my spouse had a more passive personality than I did and that was causing a lot of the tension. I tried looking through books, websites, and articles for advice. I hoped that I could bring some of the terms and explanations to his attention so that we could hash things out easier, but most of the things I find about passivity  or passive aggression sounds too extreme. They talk about how our partner secretly delights in the stress they cause, how they will take out credit cards in our name, run up the balance and leave us with the bill; things that to the average person (with a SLIGHT passive tendency) sound ridiculous. You gave me something to work with that is a normal everyday application, something that sounds non-threatening. And for that I thank you.

I do know taking a credit card in anybody’s name without consent is criminal and can be tracked. This is the age of Big brother. So any fool dumb enough to do something so stupid to mar their future instead of getting a job even part-time is a real jackhole.

Wrap my strong legs around him neck and squeez

They do delight in the stress they cause. That’s why its relentless.

Fire with fire.

I’ve got on that is Narcissistic on top of that it’s a living nightmare

My partner is just like this. I have actual goosebumps after suffering for 3 years. She does enjoy getting under my skin. It shows in a lot of what she does, but most clearly in the way that she pokes and tickles me every single day, usually when I’m resting or resting.

That to me is So f—ing. Foreign for my own behavior but what I have suspected for years in my spouse. His critical mum was the same way.  Life is way too short to play mind games and yet here we are!  I am direct, probably to a fault. I much prefer to hear reality and then we can deal with it.  My spouse has Actually said he does Not say his own truth, just what people want to hear.  How manipulative is that? !! Also shows the planning involved. Help!  I am so glad to find this site.  Thank you!

🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

He’s been ridiculed for his own truth, not manipulative. People often ask questions that they won’t like the answer to.

I am the “crazy” one because I am a woman who stands up, speaks out, you know where you stand with me. I am a mother of 3 adult daughters and a grandma of 2 granddaughters. I’m 47 yo. Just to be clear I’m proud of who I am, my dad raised me to be just as Smart if not “Schmarter” then the “Boys” I can talk cars, racing, HOCKEY!! I also love mani/pedi’s and paying for my own drinks. I didn’t have to and hated when drinks “showed” up at the table. Great…what’s the expectation. Omg he bought me a drink so now he thinks he can sit at my table. WRONG…I just read what I wrote and laughed. I sound like a bitter single or divorced woman. I have been with my husband since we were 15. So 32 years. It would make both our lives so much easier if I was a dumb or stupid “Girl” unfortunately my egotistical, macho, “crazy” dad decided his daughter (me) should be just as strong if not stronger then the boys!!! Great, how’s that working out, you ask?  Not well!!! My adult male cousins are to weak to have a conversation with me. So they try to put me down, demean me, joke about me being just a “Girl” So Sad, However their dad, my “Uncle” is the weakest man I’ve ever been around. Why is it up to me (a STRONG Woman) to dumb it down in order for the fragile male ego to survive. My husband used to be proud and would tell anyone who’d listen how strong, smart and beautiful his wife was. Now he is argumentative, picks verbal fights. Tries to act like I don’t know what I’m talking about. He asked…I answered. If I’m not 99% sure I’m right, I’ll say I’m 99% sure but I could be wrong. He knows I don’t throw down unless I am 100% sure I have all the facts. Now…when I am right, he will fight to the death knowing I know what i know. I can now see how fragile he is. So to my point if I was “DUMB” life would be much easier. For him 💜💜

I totally feel you. You should be proud and thankful you were raised strong. I am strong minded, opinionated and not “crazy” (they love to use that one to shut us up). My husband was the same. So proud to be married to a badass feminist. Now when he doesn’t get his way or Indisagree with him about something, I “hate men.”  Hebisnsonoassife aggressive our marriage with sneaky after 16 years and he has flat out stated he won’t do therapy. I can’t fix this marriage alone. And he also will constantly say I threaten to leave when we fight so I have to assure him constantly I’m not abandoning him. After 16 years!  His mother was extremely abusive and I pay the price. I’ve done therapy myself numerous times over the years and fix what I can and try to control what I can’t. It still not good enough. I do therapy speak. I feel…  he just flat out says “you always” “you never” and I can’t even call him out on it without a fight. I’m exhausted.

You go girl!!  I’m in the exact same position. I was raised to be self-reliant, smart, educated, I have lots of ideas and opinions. I am a strong woman. I take care of the entire house and I also do all the yard work , because my husband  chooses not to. I’ve got a husband who smokes too much weed, thinks he works hard, but that would be between his napping on the couch and when he’s not doing that he’s leaving mess is all over. He never listens to anything I have to say even though he knows I know what I’m talking about. He will start terrible arguments over the stupidest things, usually because I’m asking him to do something.  Because of his narcissistic passive aggressive behavior, he considers it an order and God forbid anyone told him what to do!  He will cuss and  call me every name in the book. I just shake my head and laugh at him. of course I know he’s verbally abusive but I also live in California, have a nice house and I’m not giving it up ! He’s just a disrespectful, weak scared little boy. Being a strong woman, I focus on making myself happy, I will do the things I enjoy in life, I will live life to the fullest, and I will not waste a moment of it on a pathetic, disrespectful man child.

Unfortunately your still taking his abuse with the nice home and with ignorning his behavior if you can ignore it more power to you but I have one who’s the exact same and I won’t any longer tolerate a pos man who calls me names who’s a bully who doesn’t listen and proviises notbing if I have to die to get relief from this I will.  Every holiday and bday of mine or anyone else’s right down to Mother’s Day is always ruined by some mind fuck accusations has and he’s the only cheater I know not me!!! Never been in 54 years .  I’m done

It is like you are describing my life. I am currently pregnant after suffering two miscarriages (one ectopic) and also help my father who has cancer taking him to all his appts and chemo treatments. So my plate is already full emotion wise. I also take care of all the chores in the house including laundry, yard work, cooking dinner most nights, mowing and weed whacking as well as creating and maintaining all the landscaping. I am proud of the home we have built together, and I want to maintain that. Most days I routinely complete my chores and don’t bat and eye. We have bought a fixer upper to which he has done all the renovations, which I helped with every step of the way. However since he feels he has done the renovations he feels like he has done enough apparently. I ask him to help me sometimes to empty to dishwasher if he has an extra minute or to atleast rotate laundry to keep the house chores moving along smoothly. Simple tasks to also help me as I also have a full time job.. which he does too. But he comes home and does nothing except work on his hobbies. Even though I’ve asked him already three times to please complete a task. I don’t want to be the “nagging house wife” so sometimes I’m afraid to ask and just bite my tongue and forget about it. But sometimes I voice my frustration and say I wish I had time to to read a book or to draw (my favorite hobbies) to which he becomes very passive aggressive saying things like we’re in the long haul together and hope this isn’t the way it’s gonna be or he’ll be ‘miserable’ – his words exactly, or “you’re so mean, you need to relax we don’t live in a museum”. He will also include that I’m lucky to have him and most husbands don’t have his skill of carpentry which I’m sure is true he’s very talented. But he uses that as a weapon against me. I try to stay positive and beat to my own drum but it’s hard sometimes to keep up a good morale. I’m glad I’m not alone and found this today. He’s aggressively mowing the lawn currently, and stonewalling me from a more recent argument. I asked him to please not smoke weed in the house as it is triggering my nausea/morning sickness, but he thinks if he opens a window that it’s ok. That shit stinks when you have a super pregnant nose and it just wafts through the whole house anyway. I told him at least he can get high the least he can do is move his ass 10 steps outside. Stay strong to who ever else is going through this annoying behavior to say the least. Girl power!!

Oh my gosh, it sounds like our men are twins!! I can’t stand it when mine smokes weed after I’ve spent the day cleaning the house, mopping and spraying my favorite room freshener, in he walks smelling like a freaking ashtray! These type of men also will turn any tiny menial thing into an argument, and then turn it around on you, so you’re now the bad person. I don’t even play into that bs anymore I’ll just walk away, if they don’t have any fuel for the fire it deflates them and can  make them think about their childish, disrespectful, immature behavior. Plus you just don’t have to listen to their shit ! I’m older now with two grown kids so it’s way easier. I do a lot of things on my own with friends, I’m very active, I hike and bike, take a walk on the beach…  but when I was younger as you are with young kids, it was hell!!. As I’ve gotten older  I am thankful for the life we have built and the things I have BUT their behavior takes a toll on you. I no longer have any respect for him or love, I pity him for the way he must feel inside to be so nasty and aggressive, he’s also not healthy or active. It can’t feel good to have lived your life that way. Hang in there it’s gonna be tough at times but try to be strong but remember if it’s not worth it and if you have the means get rid of him! they don’t change or get better with age! Make yourself happy that’s all that counts for the short time we have on this earth, enjoy it .

I have been dealing with my spouses behavior for 12 years it was up until I was looking for sites on signs the marriage was over I ran across passive aggressive behavior, that I see exactly who my husband is. I thought he was just purely evil and didn’t love me anymore. Now that I havr a better insight on his mind and tactics, I now after 12 years understand how to deal with him and open his eyes to how he has been abusive. He is a little calmer and surprised that I found him out. I’m not going to let my guard down, because I know as they say they are very difficult to change if never. Thanks for your research and help.

I know the answer but it may help. Get to the point and become a little like him and don’t care as much and you will find out he will care more and become a little more like you. I have the exact situation and it has worked for me.

Angie, thank you for sharing a success tip. We all need those. I don’t want to get divorced but I also don’t enjoy being made out as the “bad guy” to my kids or to have to “walk on eggs” to avert their delicate feelings.  What about our feelings?  Yes, we Do Count. If we take more  care of us and Our feelings, we will all be better off regardless of the PA ( or (RPA: royal pain in the … JK). 😊

I am here after a particularly bad episode. A small thing that turned into a full blown out fight. I was made to feel like I am wrong for reacting to his actions. We eventually came to a conclusion that we both could’ve handled it better. That was 2 days ago. He is perfectly fine with everyone around us but when it comes to me it is very evident he is very cold. Over the last 2 days I’ve tried to talk to him and he says he is not angry but continues to show me is he is angry in passive ways. We have been married for 7 years and this has always been the case. I feel so isolated when he does this. I constantly feel I need to walk on eggshells around him for him to not get angry and treat me this way. I also want to add that when things are good, he is quite nice to me, but is it wrong for me to expect consistency in good and bad times? I cannot discuss this with family or friends, because they always brush it off saying “he is such a good guy. I am sure he does not mean to hurt you”. I feel so alone and stuck in times like these.

Don’t think you’re alone.  I have the same cup of tea.  My husband’s a POS.  I call him the same thing he called Darrell Brooks….an oxygen waster.  He’s constantly mean, arrogant, stonewalling, gaslighting, etc.  I have no car and I need his medical insurance.  What I’m thinking is to find a job that will cover a few things I need and sell the house, pay off the loan and split the proceeds.  One day and it was right near my birthday, a greeting card from an old girlfriend came in the mail to him.  She was saying…Oh, I’d love to reconnect.  Years ago she dumped him.  By the way she was talking, he never told her he was married.  What an asshole.  Yeah, I’m gonna get rid of him one way or another.  Living with him is a serious drag.  I don’t get it……if he hates me so much and I think he’s totally jealous, he constantly copies me, why he doesn’t just tell me and just go his own way.  Why stay with me?  I don’t get that.  I’m gonna have to be the one and I have plenty of proof when we go before a judge.  It kills me how in the beginning, they chase you and call and call and I told him I didn’t want the relationship but he’d go running home to his mommy, I’d get a phone call asking me what’s wrong?  Since I had some run ins with the law in the past I was afraid she’d tell the police lies about me so I’d give in and go back with him.  I could have such a better life.  I just gotta suck it up and move on.  Hon, you’re not alone.  Believe me.  Hope my horror story gave you some comfort.

He is not a good guy if he treats you that way and your friends and family have no idea what goes on behind closed doors so of course that’s why they’re saying he’s a good guy. Mine does the same thing. I’ve been married going on 30 years, feels like 130!! . The older I’ve gotten I’ve learned that it doesn’t mean shit, they’re not going to change, they’re insecure and have issues. Please don’t feel isolated, it’s happening to 80% of married couples nowadays! you’re a strong woman, do not let him have any power over you or the happiness in life that you deserve. If he’s gonna act like a nasty, abusive little man child ignore him,who needs it. Go for a walk, go to a coffee shop, relax listen to some live music…there are so many things to do in life that you will enjoy. I bought myself a bike, I’ll ride 10 miles a day now , it makes me feel happy, I feel healthy, it’s exhilarating to be out in nature. Any man who treats another human being let alone a woman like that needs to grow up and doesn’t deserve a good woman by his side.

Wonderful post, Mona.  I could not have said it better.

I have a general question why are we ignoring this as women so many of us my self included why are we not leaving these men but instead going to coffee shops or staying in hotels or what have you? Said with total respect ✊🏽 btw.  I’m done I want him gone I’m tired of dancing around these abusive men who are disrespectful  this is for anyone in the thread that may be able to answer thank you all

Nietzche said to be careful when battling monsters that you do not become a monster yourself.  I don’t want to behave like them for anything in the world.

Are you still together now??

If not, she should’ve. That is no way to live. I’m living this nightmare and for financial reasons can’t leave at the moment. And the behavior makes it really hard to get a foothold as well.  I’m wondering what she means by “I now understand how to deal with him and open his eyes to how he’s been abusive.”
I mean, you can talk and talk and talk, and he or she might even act like they’re listening and seem to feel bad about it. But in my experience, they still don’t and won’t ever change. It’s not really about you but that doesn’t make it better either because for you, it is kind of about you… because it effects your life. And if they’re passive aggressive with finances then that can prove to be really dangerous.

Ohhh I am so living this! I have little hope left that anything will change and m planning my escape. Although his sabotage and passive aggressive behaviors with our business and finances makes it incredibly difficult to have time to work on anything for myself. He puts on such a good show for others saying what they need to hear and acting so easy going.. ugh if they only knew!

Oh yes! Passive aggressive with finances…my husband owned a business and never paid Payroll Withholding! It cost us thousands to keep him out of prison. Twenty years later his behavior towards me is accepting in negative ways and my health isn’t great. I’m so stuck.

Thank LuAnn.  I agree. I had No debt, owned my car outright, and was much more independent Before I married my husband. I had no idea of the Roller-Coaster of life and dangerous finances ahead to feed his ego that I would endure. I have found a counselor (multi PhD) who has dealt with passive -aggressive people for many decades and he finds them very difficult. If He finds them tough, of course the rest of us will have a tough time with them as well. I appreciate you and your input. Thank you for posting.

Also me, but I haven’t managed to make it to counseling yet. But I have started looking. Grateful to have found this forum!

LuAnn, I am in that exact boat.  With just another ugly episode last night, I was looking online for similarities to what I was going through and found this blog.  I have always lived on my own and supported myself until I got remarried, which I had never planned to do, and then Bam this economy has left me stuck. I don’t want to fail at this marriage but I also don’t want to be fighting a losing battle and be unhappy.  I wondered how you have been doing since you posted your comment.  Hope you are well.

Thank you for the smplicity of this, and the perspective.  I’ve been looking for an understanding of what’s been happening in my relationship and I’ve found it.  Next question, for me, is why I’ve attracted it…

I also have wondered why I attractive p/a people.  Twice now, I have got burned by these people.  It seems they can sense we have a helpful nature and we make an excellent prey for them to lease out their “stuff” on us.  Perhaps we ourselves have an somewhat dependent way and we look for a soft place to land?  Another thought, a taker can always smell a giver.

Ed and everyone… I can see myself So Much in each of your stories. My spouse is in AA which I have often thought he’d be happier (and probably me too)  if he was married to another AA member. The level of manipulation is devastating. I spoke recently to a therapist who called me an “empath”.  At first ,  I thought  that meant I was great at reading other peoples’ needs and meeting  those needs. Sound familiar?  He went on to explain it’s not just about the gift of being so perceptive and intuitive… the problem arises when we empaths  meet others’ needs and Forsake our own needs.  At the expense of our needs… He clarified an empath can be the ultimate “Co- dependent Emotionally”.  Ouch.  I have a lot to work on.  I’m at this point just trying to improve me and regain some independence.  Best regards to each of you. 😊

Me too

I am also dealing with a passive aggressive husband and it is truly driving me crazy.  He loves to look like the calm cool collective man that he is not especially when all the kids and their spouses come home.  I have been married for close to 35 years!!!  I just don’t think I can take it any longer.  Divorce is not an option, but going insane isn’t either.  From the 2nd year of marriage I have asked him to go with me to counseling….He will NOT do it cause there is nothing wrong with him!  I am the only one with a problem.  I have gone to couseling myself and it does help me to cope.  He says one thing and does another…..he procrastinates…he never asks me before he turns the oven off (ruins the dinner), or puts the clothes in the dryer (shrinks clothes), hides items from me, does everything the opposite of how I ask him to do it….says he can do it anyway he wants. Yikes!!  It is worse then having a child or an out of control animal in the house.  If I set something in a certain place in my home, in my room…etc…..he will change everything.  And when I can’t find it or when I am angry he gets such a smirk on his face…..I feel like I am in a never ending nightmare!

Demonic that’s what they are demons on earth 🌏 literally delighting in your sadness and sickness and when I can I’ll make sure he feels the same and I’ll delight in it for once !!!

My husband does many of the same things at home!  But  he also does this in our business. The business that I never wanted &  he insisted I help him with. He has now decided that he doesn’t like it( because it’s way more work than he thought). He also now absolutely resents me for being good at running and building the business. He uses it as a weapon against me regularly, completely ignoring protocol and  policy, asking employees to do things outside of their job description and against my own policies. as well as threatening to sell it, or just quit and go be a store clerk. Complains that working w me makes him feel small. Yet when I tell him that I’m fine with him running everything, he tellls me he doesn’t want to learn and deal w all that bullshit! We have big bills and big debt . Him selling and becoming a store clerk of course would leave that all on me.

OMG..sounds exactly like my life. I  thought for years he was just difficult but this is him!!!

Wow I think think that is my husband!   Completely different person when around others.  I can completely understand what you are going through.

Catherine,  oh dear! I am so sorry. 33 years of marriage… we could be twins separated at birth.  I am sorry you are going through this as much as I am .  I wouldn’t wish this on Anyone!  I have found the more activities I do on my own, the happier my heart is.   All the things you say your spouse does… my spouse ( his PA twin) does also.  I keep my keys in my purse with Me.  He used to open our individual car’s sun roofs ( even after I repeatedly forbade him to touch my keys or my car) and he would “forget “ the sunroofs were open… even when it rained. He actually totaled a sports car because of all the electrical damage he caused.  Wasteful and Childish!  If something is not to Directly benefit him, it holds no interest for him.   I wish I had answers for you.   Hopefully  knowing it is Not you and you are Not alone Helps.  I pray we all find a better place or  at least understanding where we are appreciated and not  abused or neglected or ignored.  This is Suppose to be a Relationship.. which means we are suppose to be relating. Not given empty promises.

I have the same things that you have written he moves things he knows I like a curtain way why I don’t know just to annoy I suppose , I’ve had the oven turned off as well when the food wasn’t cooked , it is one great big nightmare that you can never wake up from I feel for everyone who is going through  the same situation .

My husband has thrown a lot of my belongings away and when   I confront him he either denies it or tells me I didn’t need it.  He is NEVER wrong and when he is and I tell him, he starts yelling, swearing and tells me it’s me that’s wrong.  Divorce is not an option but I wish it were.

Ditto. Your experience is shared.  Thank you for your post.

Im sorry I have a husband like that I feel for you. Mine, he is hard of hearing & has used that as a tool when he wants to. I feel like Im die-ing, the stress is killing me, I cant say anything, if I do he yells, then he complains I don’t talk to him?😳 I am so tired of being yanked around, He changes like the wind, like some else commented its worse then dealing with a bad child. I feel physically drained & to my wits end. Ive tried everything the gambit to help him understand or work things out but obviously he doesn’t want that he enjoys the upheaval, the stress the yelling, he has tantrums & likes to make big scenes, Ive come to the conclusion he’s sick, a p/a narcissist with explosive intermittent behavior and the worse part is I feel the same way that he preyed on me. The terrible thing is being married to him for forty years, the Bible says at Proverbs 13:20 that:”He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly.” I have no one to blame but myself, I chose wrong apparently. I know Im not perfect & I have numerous faults myself, but I try, I try to get along. We separated, it was wonderful! I felt like a weight was lifted off my back, the house felt airier & lighter, but he ended up having a evolving heart attack & moved back home & with in no time everything went spiraling backwards again.. sometimes & I probably shouldn’t say this but I wish I could just die then Id at least  get away & have peace. Only Id miss my only Grandgurl who is a epileptic & needs me. Thank you for letting me vent & God Bless you all..🙏

Exactly in your situation and have a son with special needs . I wish I would die too but I have a son that needs me . I’m so tired .

Bee, Bless You for sharing. Please don’t wish to die. The universe or God doesn’t  hear sarcasm. I used to think the same thing. We had a house fire started by an inept HVAC guy.  Initially I was crushed not only by the shock of the fire or temporarily losing my house and having to move during rebuild; my PA spouse went outside and Only looked after his safety during the fire. My son and I along with our dogs and fosters were inside. My husband had no issue leaving us behind. Mind Blown!😵‍💫😱. I had no idea of his level of PA and narcissistic core.  The guys who “rebuilt” our house messed it up and grew mold. I got sick and nearly died several times while in the hospital for 3 months.  It messed up my immune system wand I am still recovering with surgeries ahead of me.  So Please don’t wish to die to solve all this mess.  All I can hold firmly to is God Does have a Purpose for Each of us. Maybe to support others going through the same stuff?   Whom else would understand? Without walking in Our shoes?  God Also Loves Us! This is not our home.  When I was in the hospital some of the medical staff would ask, “ why you”.  I always felt… Why Not me.  We are SURVIVORS.    For whatever reason this is our lot. We can choose  to accept and make the best of it. Or we can try to help others and in turn we are helped. God Bless You Bee! You are a child of God. You are Loved.  Whatever you need,  Ask.  Our prayers do get answered. Sometimes by what we need, not what we want. 💖

I feel your pain Bee it’s only financial reasons I’m just  hanging in there  he is disrespectful to me and could make trouble in an empty room and still blame me for everything .

This is my situation exactly.  My life is played out throughout this list of comments.  I feel calmed knowing it’s not my isolated problem..there are hundreds of PANs out there, I too am in my mid 60’s and retirement is ruined by the constant yelling, negativity and control.  He used to work away and I felt I was missing out on life having to do everything on my own…but now I realise how lucky I was.  It’s twice as hard now he’s home all day.  He’s a perfectionist with OCD and I just dont come up to his standards.  I suffer badly from anxiety and cringe when he starts yet another row over something trivial, he lets rip and the neighbours must hear it all…I feel so vulnerable but I get great comfort from praying and turn to God whenever I need him.

Anon, Bless You!  Prayer creates Miracles if only to allow us to live on another day. God does give Comfort. I am right there with you in your struggles. Interesting we found this blog. Thank God for that.   I so understand when my husband traveled and I was so expected to and Was the single parent even though he lived in the same home. I used to stay up until wee hours cleaning house or preparing my children’s clothes or whatever to keep the family functioning or do I thought. He was totally absent even when here. Now he travels so much less and I realize him being gone Was my sanity.  You are so right, underfoot is worse. I’m 64. Unemployed right now due to health issues. I do believe we frequently get sick physically because of the emotional black hole that sucks all our energy from our spirit. Thank God we can  refill it in praise and prayer. That is frequently my sanity nowadays. Bless you.

When it was time for my husband to retire I felt so depressed at the thought now he has retired I was right to be depressed it’s a nightmare he is  spoiling my retirement I carnt relax  and do anything that he doesn’t spoil , he never wants me to enjoy anything birthdays Christmas etc never wants to give me a present although I give him one and other members of my family , he causes arguments over trivial issues and hates it when he fails at anything  he carnt do and  I get blamed for that as well . We have to look  after our own mental wellbeing and forget there’s like they have done to ours , one day one of us will need the help of the other one I just hope it’s not me needing help from him .

Amen. They are not good caregivers. Infact I think it makes them cringe to think of giving of self to anyone or anything. Especially spouse or family. Unless it’s for Show.   Uggghh.    Let’s take care of us. We deserve Great things in our lives. We Are lovable and we do know how to love. Look what we have endured. It can’t be for  nil.

Praying for you 🙏🏾

Get out!

Yes, I agree, leave him or get him out. Your life will be so much more airier, peaceful and wonderfully simple. Please do not think of death as an opportunity of a way out, your Granddaughter needs you so much and the rest of your family who love you. Ive not had a easy life either. But my Sis-in-laws Beautiful Sister got divorced a few years ago. She brightened every room, had 3 beautiful older teen boys, who loved her so much. Had a great job and life with so many friends. Yet before Christmas without anyones knowledge of her unhappiness, she in her early 50’s took her own life. We are a very close family. My own Mother is 80, she couldn’t or wouldn’t go to her funeral as she didn’t want to ruin the day by crying. I told my mum the day previous to her funeral that I didn’t want to go either as I suffer from severe depression. My Mum said she wished she cud come with me. Where my courage came from, Ive no idea, maybe because I knew I had to for the sake of my Mum. I went and thankfully I done well, obviously knowing our family and her family needed me. Everyone in her life is heartbroken, never ever think that is the way out, just get him out of your life and in time you will be so thankful that the  best decision you ever made for not just yourself but for all your loving family. Ive 3 kids, I separated from my narcissistic husband 10 years ago but should have done it much sooner. I hope and pray that you reach the point an realise you, your family are much more important than one person who willingly wants to hurt you. It’s only one person and without him you will begin in time to love yourself & your life again. I wish you well & I pray that you find the courage to remove him from your life.

I feel your pain. I have a girlfriend of a year that has been this way for a year. I try to tell her with boundaries and respect then I have to yell it seems. She acts like she is calm but she hides all her stuff inside and acts it out. By doing weird things. I say please don’t put the totes in the back of the truck I will do that because I’m a better organizer. But I understand that how they play pretend and then do all the opposites that you ask. Even forget things, and not do what you ask, or give you something other then you want. Then want praise for making lunch. It gets complicated forsure.

David Boggess, not sure what others are thinking but my thoughts are you are the p/a narcissist who wants everything your way or no way. I truly fell sorry for you girl friend. Seriously, you dont allow a person you love to put totes in truck cause u can do it it better as well as the other things you criticise her, your girlfriend who I would assume is a girl who loves or loved you. Re-read your own story, to me you sound like a total control freak. If I made a lunch for my kids and husband an he complained that he wanted something else, which happened to me for a very long time, I’d remove you from my life as I did with ex, but I tried to hide his emotional and mental abuse for much longer than I should’ve.  I feel sorry for that girl and hope she’s well rid of you now

Catherine, without risking those who would call me a Bible Thumper, may I say first that I can totally relate to everything everyone is going through on here, and may I say that I have been married 52 years.  My situation with my own husband is a bit different, and totally private, but he has been not dealing with some issues in his life for a very long time, and is into “escapist” behavior.  Nothing immoral, just too much into tv shows, or ignoring the family at times, you know just being mentally unavailable….but he can also be guilty of the p/a behavior as well.  What has helped me tremendously is my Faith in God and my Personal Relationship with Jesus Christ.  Christ has shown me how to see the problems, not to dislike the person, but how to be the kind of person that will “enhance” my husband’s life, and to pray for “him”.  Wasn’t easy at first, but when I began to see some really great, positive changes in Him, I thanked God for it, you know.  And yes, women save yourselves.  Do what you can to be a good wife, but save yourself.  Get involved in activities and with people that have positive vibes, you know.  And when things get really trust, pray.  It works.  God Bless You All.  It DOES get better.  Day at a time, right?

He said that since the second year of marriage you have had this problem with him and that you have been with him for over 35 years. Honestly, you sound like you are not very smart and have not learned your lesson. Clearly you are still allowing him to talk to you that way, and every time you do you grant him permission saying it’s okay to talk to you this way. Time to stand up for yourself, because clearly after over 35 years, at the time of this comment, you clearly haven’t been stepping up.

🤔 Are you Catherine’s husband? W0W😳 talk about being insensitive… I hope counseling isn’t your forte. Being direct is good but W0W!

“Divorce isn’t an option”. #1 reason marriage is an absolute waste and a trap. Imagine had you not, you could simply feel free to leave this obviously infantile creature. But wait. Nothing is stopping you, is there? What would stop you from leaving? I mean, I have a hard time believing that you were able to procreate with what is obviously a child. If anything, that calls into question what you might be into, madam.

Oh look the narcissists have arrived in full force. No one cares what you think.  Leave this lady alone.  Marriage might mean nothing to you but its sacred to decent people.

You totally described my life and my husband perfectly. I insisted on marriage counseling 12 years ago.  What a waste!  Every single appointment was the same as the first, like starting over from scratch.

Sounds like my husband.  I am ready to choke him out!!!  He drives me nuts!!!  And, on top of everything else, he has ADHD!!!  Lord help me!!!

You just hit on the exact entity that will help you…The Lord!

Although my husband doesn’t do exactly the things you mentioned your husband does, my husband seems to enjoy my not being happy about certain things. I have learned not to respond so he doesn’t know. Isn’t that a great way to live? No, I probably won’t seek a divorce but I certainly pray a lot! And through that, I have learned to survive and be happy. Not happy with the relationship! But happy in spite of it. It ain’t easy, I know. It’s nice to get support just hearing what other people are going through but still sorry to hear it.

God Bless you, Susanne.  You’re working on your marriage and deciding that you cannot control another person’s behavior.  And yes, prayer will do more for your relationship than anything.  I’m not against counseling, and have done that as well.  But prayer is POWERFUL and WORKS!!!

You’re just as much of a problem as the original poster. You are quite literally allowing these people to do this and get away with it. You are giving them permission and allowing it to continue. On top of this, you’re dumb enough to pray and think that it does anything other than placebo effect. This is exactly why abusers are able to do what they do.

Your name says all the advise you need…..you should  TAKE it!

You sound passive aggressive

Begone demon, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
 You have no power here.  Your time is short and you are angry just as Scripture foretold.
 You are of your father the devil who was a murderer from the beginning.  He is the father of lies and there is no truth in him.  When you speak you speak in his character- nothing but damnable lies.

I totally agree with you

I normally would of agreed with you on not letting a toxic abuser get away with it, but after living through it as a victim myself recently, I learned that there is no changing someone like that unless they get therapy. Luckily for me, I did not have a lot of time invested in the relationship and got out. She is married to her abuser and Im sure she’ll leave the relationship once its right for her.

To name call Susanne or anyone who is going through difficulties in their relationship is just totally unfair.  Susanne has found that prayer works in her situation.  I have found it immensely helpful in mine.  No one is saying that YOU have to adopt a faith or pray if you choose not to.  And you are misreading those who choose to work within their marriages to make them work.  No one is saying that disrespectful or passive aggressive behavior is acceptable.  We are just acknowledging that certain situations can trigger this behavior and trying to understand the person we cohabitate with.  That is far from being dumb, in fact, to take the time to care and to pray and to analyze behavior is anything but.

Wow the Bible thumber, whent full PA right there.

Maybe the thumping should  be to your head…..how was that for passive-aggressive…..oh wait that would be just aggressive 🤔

That’s all true but, what about liking yourself enough not to be continually abused.  Whether it’s physical or emotional, it’s still abuse and no one should live like that.

Can we just get something straight here. Abusive men do not go for weak little women, they go for strong, independent smart ones. So much better to knock them down, a better challenge. It takes one person to abuse, just one and it’s a choice they make. It’s very hard and dangerous to leave a truly abusive relationship and people who comment like that haven’t got a clue. They make it so much worse.

No they shouldn’t but believe it or not its not going to make a difference what anyone says or shames them. That usually causes a person with these types of problems to with draw…Don’t you think if they have enough sense to acknowledge & write about it that they have a inclination of whats up & going on? Maybe they just need validation or a kind listening ear rather than critical words or harsh judgment. Theres a lot to be said for trying to walk a mile in another’s shoes! Understandably your angry & upset of the injustice that is happening but again you attrack more ants to honey, kindness sympathy & empathy go a lot further & a longer way then becoming combative, isn’t that what going on to begin with? What started this blog conversations?

I’ve been married for 35 years to a passive aggressive spouse. For 27 years I knew something was wrong in the marriage, but I thought it was all my fault. I thought I must be asking wrong. 8 years ago, I learned I had breast cancer. After 3 surgeries, chemo, and radiation, I am doing ok. When I was diagnosed, it became extremely clear to me that it was not my fault and that he was a passive aggressive spouse. He was never there for our children (never his fault) has never apologized for anything, if I ask him a question, he won’t answer. He’s now talking about retiring, and I am miserable. I’ve been a stay at home mom since 1984. I’m now 63 years old, and hate the thought of starting over at this age. Right now, my 89 year old mom is 1000 miles away and is having health issues. I’ve learned not to tell him anything because he will just come back and say it’s all my fault. Well, at least I feel better for venting. Still not sure what path to take – I really don’t enjoy doing activities with him any more. If we go somewhere, he won’t talk to me in the car at all, then when we get to the activity with friends, he is as charming as he can be. Everyone tells me how lucky I am to have him because he’s such a great guy. He’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde!

Please  go visit  your mom if you can…by yourself….time away might be good for you. Hopefully  you can get some perspective on your situation! Best of luck to you and your future!

I find your description to your partner “Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde” hilarious coz that’s how I call my husband.

I agree with the Jekyll and  Hyde personality.   People think my husband is   friendly and sweet,  but he’s the opposite at home to me.   I call it booby trapping when my husband interferes with any project,  meal or plans  I make.   He screws up things deliberately and then claims it’s not his fault.  then when I get angry or upset he twists the situation to being my fault.   I can’t leave either due to financial reasons.   I  just stay crazy in this marriage.

Hi dusty sorry to hear that – I hope you can get out. Pls find a way. I felt I should share my story on why you should get out. In the last I was married to a very evil passive aggressive narcissist in the past. He was truly pure evil. He started the relationship telling me all the things I wanted to hear… I wanted to get married and have a family ( he already had kids from his past marriage) and he told me he would be happy to do to all again but he never had any intentions – he lied to get what he wanted. What I didn’t realise early on as well is He deliberately wanted to control everything and me. He started causing conflict deliberately over anything he could in order to see me upset or get into an argument. It started subtly I now look back and remember the first time he stonewalled me and wouldn’t tell me what was wrong to make me feel bad and control me. I hadn’t done anything wrong but he gaslighted me. Then a few months later it happened again and and then again and before I knew it 3 years in he was doing it almost daily. He would continually gaslight and try and trick me into thinking things being all my fault. He would twist my words. He would even change my words, I recorded him once and I then knew he twisted everything. It got worse and worse, he would call me names and pick on my features , He would say anything to get a reaction. An example-  I remember to demonstrate how pathetic it was…..  we needed a new toaster as ours died and on the way to the shops out of nowhere he said he would pick it because I’m too dumb to buy a decent toaster. Another time on a road trip out of nowhere he said to me ” you don’t really care or have an appreciation for nature do you”…. I said sure I do what do you mean? And he said you don’t really have the intellect for it…. anything like this to start a fight or put me down – he did this especially as I’m in the car and can’t get away or go to another room – he trapped me…. it was his tactic and I stupidly took the bait. He would also act nicely in front of company and then stonewall me soon as we left or kept arguing – nothing ever got resolved because he didn’t want it to it was his way of controlling me. He would say nasty things about my friends and call them stupid. He tried to stop me from seeing them – thank god I didn’t . He would also do stuff like deliberately mutter things so I couldn’t hear him and tried to make me feel hard if hearing . What sort of person does this! He would make me feel bad about buying anything for myself even though I worked full time. It became financial abuse . He hid and moved things around the house to make me feel I was going crazy. when he stopped working he also did nothing around the house  – wouldn’t even make dinner – he left it all to me to do and I stupidly did it. He got more and more verbally abusive as well to the point it was every day almost every hour he was attacking me …After 5 years I was so broken and we went for counselling – I just wanted the abuse to stop – I felt smothered. It didn’t help and I ended up in counselling for a solo session and the therapist said ” I don’t normally say this but I recommend you end the relationship – it’s not going to get better – he will never end it – it will continue, he then said “you are young and haven’t had children yet, you don’t have to have this life”. The next person you meet will be completely different…. it can be the one you share a home and life with . I was 29 at this stage and my husband was much older with kids from a previous marriage as mentioned.  Anyhow Thank god for that therapist as I ended it right after that and my whole life changed. I started feeling happy and safe and strong and confident. I got all new furniture for the house after he took everything – I didn’t like most of it anyway as he controlled all the choices…. I spent time with my friends realised what a burden my constant sadness had been on them and how long they listened to my woes for and I realised they were my life savers. I thank them for my life.  I then started doing better at work as was not crying every night. I could focus again. I started taking in the simple pleasures of life and feeling there was hope. Life became beautiful again. I then met a man a year later whom is now my husband and we have an 8 yr old son together whom we adore. We have a home and pets and we travel and he is my best friend. Life is too short to be with someone that delights in hurting their partner. Xx I’m 43 now and that hell I loved was from age 24-29 – I wasted precious years of my youth to that soul sucker….. never again xxx I hope my story can help others see you can’t change people like that. It’s a sickness in them.

It sounds like we are living with the same person , I feel for you it’s such a shame that people can’t be happy  it’s a waste of life when we should be living in harmony with each other it’s just  how someone people have grown up I suppose.

That’s me in a nutshell, and have referred to exactly that jeckle and hyde ..sweet as pie when I am compliant. The second I speak up about something no matter how soft handed I make it flow towards him, I get bitten with words that sting me for days. Then I’m depressed, I don’t trust him with my heart. I now find myself disassociating from him and not sharing anything with him because I don’t trust him with my heart because I feel guarded.

I’m finally out of that kind of marriage.  I’m not okay but I’m paddling like a duck.  My advice to you would be to care for your ailing mom and make it a permanent visit.  I wouldn’t tell him that though.  You will find that being absent will not make your heart grow fonder.  Hope life gets better. By the way, I’m 56 years old.  Learning to start over again.  I like not walking on eggshells in a home where you can cut the tension with a knife.

You are my age and Im going through what you went through.  I am convinced I’m on the right path because after 15 months apart I do not miss him and feel so much less stressed because I don’t have to deal with the daily eggshells.  This morning he texted me to say he is going to get divorce papers done.  This stresses me out and I’m back to my good old self again because I know he won’t put anyone but himself into consideration, especially not me and not our 4 kids who are adult now but are still affected by his self piteous ways, and subtle smearing on how “their mom can be”.  He does not care about the 30 years that I managed to make a loving family.  He will make them take sides because that’s how he works.  It’s all games, and he needs to win, even at the expense of any of us.  I’m so tired of  being in survival mode for 30 yrs, I don’t have strength or desire to fight.  To see you made it through and are on the other side is encourageing.

After 3 years of marriage and 3 years before of hell, I finally gave into my husband’s threat of moving out and said go! (nearly 2 months ago).  I am 62 and it was the last thing I wanted, but since he has been gone, I’m a new person as well.  It was the biggest blessing and I am free and happy and stress free and anxiety free and no more tension.  Absence has NOT made the heart grow fonder and he is trying to reconcile and I keep saying I need more time.  I am now in the driver’s seat in relation to my mental health and I am A OK.  I hope this helps.

Definitely helps.  Thankyou.  I too am suffering needlessly  my husband has a passive aggressive behaviour.

I’m in the same boat Val why us if you’re like me you know you don’t deserve to be treated like you mean nothing  they are vampires after your happiness  try not  to let him get any I know it’s not easy .

Why would you want him back you know what he is like.

My husband of nearly 40 years drives me nutzs. He retired a year ago and things are a whole lot worse.
Today at my wits end I told him that he is PAN.
passive aggressive narcissistic.
He is now sulking and being the victim…..again.
It’s impossible to have a conversation with him ????‍♀️
What starts out as something so small turns into an argument.
He has no respect for me , never says he is sorry. Well why would he. He is always right‼️
He has a mean streak in him. He goes from being human to a snake ???? attack.
Yep. That’s him.
Flip flop. Never know which one I am seeing till he shows me.
My kids never gave me this much trouble ‼️
They were well behaved well adjusted happy kids and adults. Thankfully hubby worked so they didn’t see any of this growing up ‼️
So fed up with him and how hard he is making my life. You would think at my age of 72 I wouldn’t have to deal with his pan.
Personally I think he is loving it ‼️

Know what you mean .

This is terrible I bieve you cause I’m suffering too.  I am 69.

I’m 67 I think our men don’t have any respect for anyone  they are bored with their lot so they take it out on us .

I am 70, and my husband is your age.  I feel your pain.  I go through similar things with my own.  I have noticed that my husband improves immensely when he eats right, gets proper rest, and takes the time to do something he enjoys, like go to the driving range.  I think what we have to realize is, that these old men we are married to, they just have no idea how their inattentiveness or their closed off behavior, or that switch, where they get frustrated and angry, can just break their wive’s hearts.  We may not be able to do much about their behavior, but we can certainly avoid them when they are at their worst, and do all we can to save ourselves and our own sanity by becoming involved in things that make US happy, you know.  God Bless You All, and I’ll pray for ALL.

Yes I agree , some men never seem to find there place in retirement they have worked and now can’t find enough to do so they just get bad tempered with us  I’m sure some men find plenty to do and they hopefully aren’t  so bad tempered .

God bless you all too x  used to think he was just insensitive to my feelings but I now know he has a passive aggressive personality and yes he can have attention deficit too

If he has a mean streak in him he isn’t passive agressive. Passive agressive behavior is someone who appears very empathetic on the outside, but does things that display their anger. Like slamming cupboards and dishes, acting non affectionate, doing things they KNOW drive you crazy, undermining you constantly, lying about big decisions you made together and decided on long ago and when confronted they play the victim and act as if you’re crazy. I’ve been dealing with my passive agressive wife and its making be blow up in anger. Its evil to the core and evilly destructive.

I feel for you.  I try to ignore my husband and not let him hurt my feelings when he shouts at me not just indoors but outside too and he just does it because he knows it hurts and upsets me.  He can turn on a sixpence and I can’t understand what I’ve done wrong!!

You won’t have done anything wrong it’s them

You are describing my life and marriage. Especially doing the things they know drive you crazy and lying about decisions and plans we made together. For the longest time i have wondered how it is possible that i have asked him not to do certain things millions of times, and he still does them, is it because he forgets or because he simply does not care but now i realize its because he gets pleasure from it. And the realization makes me feel paranoid and crazy

This! My husband always says he forgot.  And then acts injured and like I am crazy and unreasonable when I ask him if he really forgot because I have asked him to not do that or please remember this so many times!

Oh boy I could have written this myself especially the bit how you have asked him not to do certain things and he still does them I’m sure my husband does that because he’s getting pleasure from it too l wish I could meet someone else like his first wife did and then dump him I’m not a nasty person but I can’t keep being treated like I don’t matter  ,I don’t deserve to be treated like this from someone who has no manners or respect for me  .

This last bit about him “getting pleasure from it” pretty much tallies up the total futility of dealing with him on any level.  This person is AN ASSHOLE.  These types are intentionally destructive to their partners physiological health and they’re utterly insidious. I equate it to a total lack of love in their hearts.

You nailed it

Sounds just like my husband too!!!!

Here I thought I was married to a special kind of ass, but sounds like most men are made from the same cloth.  All the years I worked in a nursing home, the conclusion was that the women lost their minds (because of the men) and the mens bodies were ruined, because of the women.

Reading this everything is the same with my husband. Absolutely everything. I have been married 24yrs and with him about 30yrs. I’m at a loss what to do with him hes so angry as well most of the time. Never complimentary about me, constantly lying. Will never move when he’s at home. Some small argument turns into something major in he walks out the house and sleeps in the car. So not normal. then when I get worked up he smirks. on top of all this he is verbally abusive. I have been called all the names you can think of. he is also a taker and i’m a giver. he as no empathy towards me at all. I collapsed once whilst at home he walked over me and went to work. Nothing from him all day. He turned around and said to me why should I help you we had been arguing. This to me is horrendous behaviour. Cope by doing your own thing and count them out of the equasion. You won’t change them because everything is everyone else’s fault. Look into their family there will probably be mental health issues within people in it.

if he’s verbally abusive he isn’t passive agressive, he just has anger issues. Passive agressive people are very calm natured.

Sorry, but passive aggressive people are NOT always calm natured.

No correlation whatsoever beyond the confines of your own beliefs.  The one can absolutely coexist with the other, and it often does.  Anyone who thinks that mean angry people can’t be absolutely passive aggressive as well, is either working with just one particular “sample” person, who just so happens to not “appear passive aggressive”, or, and more likely, they just need to get out more!
It should also be firmly understood, that many passive aggressive types have been mastering their passive aggressive behaviors throughout their lives.  It can be extremely hard to recognize on the receiving end… and there is so often cognitive dissonance involved as they’re masters of the mind game and “plausible deniability”.
Toxic persons come in all stripes, and comorbidity of personality disorders is the rule more than the exception.  You don’t need to diagnose them, because naming which stripe they are is not that important.  What is important is this… If you’re feeling hurt and confused, and your gut is telling you that something is wrong, but you can’t seem to put your finger on it…. And this isn’t just a one off but it’s long term dynamic sort of thing…. Then “YOU” are probably “In Play” with a toxic partner.  You will be undermined, especially psychologically.  Your needs will be minimized and denied systematically over time.  Your expectations will be “managed down to below zero”.  But… please do not make the mistake of thinking that passive aggressive behavior is not malignant at the core.  By it’s very nature, passive aggression is covert and underhanded with bad intentions. “Aggression” wouldn’t even be part of the term if meanness and anger weren’t in play.  A person with love in their heart and who has a conscience, good will and good intentions, does NOT behave in such unhealthy and unproductive ways.  The healthy loving respectful person is going to appreciate and seek win win outcomes, especially in their primary relationship.  Passive aggressive behavior is the exact opposite of caring, considerate, respectful behavior.  You can literally tabulate it out to a person in relation”shit” who wants power and control and who must win at all costs and subversive manipulative covert underhanded maneuvers are the tool of choice for these malignant malicious ones.  They win.  You lose.  Great relationship right?  And they can always deny deny deny insinuating that you are crazy if you call them on it and flip the script and blame shift and well, don’t even get me started on the menagerie of bullshit mindfuckery they’ll unleash to psychologically derail you.  Ultimately resorting to attack screaming veins bulging in your face bullying intimidation behavior.  That right there is just evil coming out, and that’s their last card.  You will be denied your truths, shocked into silence.  Eggshells will be your existence from then on.  They will conveniently forget it all as if nothing happened at all.  Just evil.

Sounds exactly like my husband. I feel like I have to compete with him all the time. It has really started to affect my health in the last 10 years so I have to now put myself first and my health before it’s too late.

This comment resonates with me. I didn’t grow up in a competitive, win/lose, critical/shaming home, so I had no previous concept of the tactics my spouse routinely employs to recreate this toxic environment. It is absolutely in his DNA and I am the prime target. He recruits our kids to his “side” and doesn’t think I notice. Sometimes I feel sorry for him – he says I’m his best friend – but can PA people develop healthy relationships? I often feel crazy in his presence. I feel relieved when I get away and do things that make me happy. I am so tired of playing this game.

Yes they leave you no choice you’re love you once had for them has gone because of all the lies that they have made up about you every thing just dies they are there own  worst enemy and you’re worst nightmare .

Nah, he can definitely be both. Even the healthiest people aren’t consistent in behaviors and temperament.  And I would not use the word “just” to describe anger issues. If he’s abusive, it’s not “just” anything.  And yeah, there can be a mix of flawed characteristics in one person. One day he may be overtly abusive and the next do something under the radar. Besides, slamming cabinets is passive aggressive and I would not call that calm behavior.  However yes, some PAs are calm. My hub is a perfect example of that. Very calm an quiet. Quite the weasel actually.

contradicting and minimizing this makes you sound passive aggressive

I’m sorry, Bonus but these women have a right to share their stories of what ‘s going on in their lives and it has nothing to do with contradictions.  It certainly doesn’t make THEM passive aggressive to express that they are going through a difficult time.

There are levels of passive aggressive.  Also, one can be passive aggressive AND rotten.  Don’t tell her she doesn’t know; she knows!

All I can say is, “Me, too!”

Thanks for this information and especially for the website. I love my husband of 30 years very much. We’ve been working on these issues because he had such a terrible childhood he was left damaged. There is hope, folks. Give your passive-aggressive spouse the information; if he really wants to stay married he won’t procrastinate anymore. He’ll start reading about it, get embarrassed and finally start changing back into the person you married. I say this because it’s happening for my relationship, now. It takes time and patience. I have to remind myself he’s like this because of a rotten childhood, not because he hates me. It’s hard, never let your guard down. But, if you love them enough, work with your passive aggressive partner to help them change. They really can change if they want to and have a bit of help.

There are days I feel this same kind of hope. But I’m not convinced it ever really goes away. PA people identify as victims and put responsibility for their emotional state on things outside of their control.

Thank you for the encouraging response & suggestions. You obviously have a kind & patient heart & have the ability to say look the glass is half full.. I hope & pray things continue to improve for you. I try to remember Jesus’s  sacrifice & what he bore for all of us..

OMG, really!  I’ve been married to a PA for 25 years.  Your response just makes me laugh.
Sorry.

I don’t find anything funny about all of the pain that many of us have been going through for so long.  And partners ARE capable of change.  Mine has, and so can others, so laugh at yourself first, or don’t laugh at the pain that others are going through.

Makes me laugh too. PA spouses don’t change. They make you crazy and enjoy the ride! They are determined in the belief that their emotional misery and suffering is caused by everyone else, never by their own actions/choices. I am going on 26 yrs. marriage w/junior high age children. You either accept them or move on. For now, I choose to stay… more good days out-weight the bad days, but when they are bad… ouch!!

I don’t have the patience for it.

I was so confident in his work and just as he said in the beginning, my husband is finally back to me again, yes he is back with all his hearts, Love, care, emotions and flowers and things are better now. I would have no hesitation to recommend this powerful Man to anybody who is in need of relationship/marriage help.. E-mail; ____________________________r.buckler@ [hotmail] com

It doesn’t matter. The man that changed is the exception. Nobody has tried harder than I have to calmly call out the behavior and refuse to cover for it .. to start over and try this intervention or that one … he will never change and wasting all those years trying only ruined my life more.  At the start I read they would never change; I wish I’d cut out so many years ago.

I think you’re probably right it’s the same thing over and over again I just don’t get people who just want to cause problems for others then have the nerve to blame them for something they haven’t even done .

I have been married 27 years. My husband’s passive aggressive behavior has almost killed me literally. The past 3 years has been most emotionally stressed for me.  Being treated for stress, anxiety,  panic attacks,  loss of weight,  fighting depression,  I couldnt handle his behavior and get well in my body. I. packed and ran for my life, my sanity, and a even a chance to save the marriage.  The separation has been extremely painful especially with unanswered questions. I couldn’t figure out if I was crazy, didn’t understand my husband crazy-making behavior until one my girlfriends described my husband as passive aggressive.  After coming across websites like this has given me a since of relie. Everything I’ve read about PAs fits my husband to a T. And i tried to get him
 to take a look at the symptoms.However, instead of seeing it as a way for our relationship to get
better, he felt I was attacking him as PAs often do. It doesn’t matter what concerns or issues I try to discuss with him, gently or not, crying or not, he saw it as me attacking him, blaming him. He does not take responsibility or accountability for anything.  He
completely shuts down on me and quietly punishes me or get back at me. 99% of the time he does not
 communicate with me about anything. Only when he wanted something from me, he would communicate.  Any concerns I had, he would totally ignore.  It amazes me how he would stonewall
 me. Not just for days but months! He totally detach himself from me with no intention or concern of
working through the problem.  So I could never get him to show any concerns for my feelings, which
chips away at your self esteem. It said that i didnt matter. When in a corner,  he  would blatantly lie.
Present himself has calm but full of anger which i would later have to suffer the consequences through his undermining way. I would beg, plead, cry, pray, trying to get him to treat me right, trying to
get him to make this marriage work. Have asked him WHY countless times.. To no avail. We’ve gone to counseling twice in past 3 years. Each time he never finish. Two different therapist required work
from him. He didnt like that and stop going but yet said he would do anything to save marriage (lie)
He  NEVER explained to me why he stopped going. Being exhausted emotionally,  physically,  I didn’t bother to ask why. It had gotten to be too much for me. His  behavior was as if the counseling never
happened or existed. Much like how he’s treating me now. Together over 30 years and he has
discarded me like a piece of trash. Refusing to communicate with me. Taking every opportunity to be
 spiteful to me. Ive learned because he doesn’t know how to deal with his anger, he cannot accept
responsibility or accountability, he only surround himself around those that do not hold him
accountable and thinks he’s the best thing since slice bread. He creates his own world that makes him comfortable.. In the relationship, either I had to accept him and his abusive behavior or jump
ship. I held on for as long as I could.  Suffering with stress, in and out of ER, no reasoning with him,
absolutely emotionally exhausted. It seem the more I begged him, the worse he got. It was as if he
thrived on my misery.  What happened to this man? … I had to decide whether I wanted to live or die. It
 was THE HARDEST decision I have made in my life as my family is most important to me. However, abuse overt or covert is unacceptable.  I never thought I would be in this place at this point of my life.  My heart is still open to saving my marriage if my husband recognize his issue and seek help for it.

I know what you’re talking about it is exhausting and painful that someone who is ment to love you has no feelings for you at all .

What a horror.  I hope you survived this ordeal 10 years ago.
The last part is so telling. The narcissist is now getting their “supply” off your negative energy/emotional response.  The more you hurt, the better they feel about themselves.  It’s just a game to them and you are nothing.  You never were anything, even when they had you up on that pedestal at the start.  It was all manipulation and pretend.  Nothing real with them ever.  It was always about power and control and winning.. for them.  They literally view relationships as win lose.  It’s so backwards even that at the end, if they aren’t hurting you, they feel like they’re losing, so they literally are compelled to hurt you so they can “win”. It has a very sadistic slant to it.  Yes… the more they can frustrate you by denying your needs and your very reasonable relationship requests, the happier they will be!  They’re in control.  Look how powerful they are… you are just smaller and more ridiculous than an ant under their foot.  Don’t miss the narcissistic smirk.  That’s pure glee of having been a “MASTER ASSHOLE” and having fooled the victim into thinking that it’s them, they’re crazy and it’s their own fault (this caustic abuse) AGAIN!  They’ll happily play this game till you are turned into dust. It’s highly entertaining for them.  They’ll watch intently for your emotional hurt, your agony, and they absolutely get off on it.  Sick.  Evil.  Toxic.  Real as a heart attack.

My heart relates and aches at your story. May God help us.

Your story sounds like the same script so many of us have all been playing by with an SO who is passive aggressive in every aspect of their life and yours. I too have been married for 34 years and I too am standing at a place where the road is divided, one road to PA and the other to a more health way of doing life…ALONE. The choice isn’t easy and I’ve yet too make that choice. I feel ya, I feel all of your stories and ya know what I hold onto, myself. What else can ya do? God is already with you and that’s what you hold onto until YOU are ready for a life that’s not full of another person anger and frustration. And then we all could just laugh at the absurdity of the situation and keep on living and doing what you know is right and be happy with yourself and what you want from life, peace. Maybe these words will give another person validation and hope that it’s OK and you do have this, even with the PA telling you different. Sometimes I think GOD is laughing at us all, for we do amuse him, we have too. LOL

[…] My boyfriend broke up with me 4 months ago but finally came back with the help of Robinsonbuckler11@ gmail. com………Thank you SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much!!!!! […]

My heart hurts and so relieved at the same time. I have been with my husband for almost 6 years, we have a 2yr old and this is exactly what I’ve been going through. He shuts down, blank stares, does not take accountability, unreliable but shows up. will mess up, do something wrong, never follows thru 100% (not based on perception but a fact) he will not feel or show any remorse. In fact, if I point it out or get upset because he promised he would do something and doesn’t then it’s my fault and he tells me that I just talk to much. I’ve asked, begged, pleaded, cried, got loud and angry, practically had panic attacks lately. he just stares at me and then will ask if I’m done talking and will turn around walk away as if I’m non-existent.?.?.?.?.  I’ve asked politely “do I met your needs?” He responds, “no, not all.” Okay fair enough I say in a calm curious manner… “What needs do I not met?” He responded “I don’t know.” He really doesn’t know. His face his eyes say it all. It’s like you see the wheels turning and he is trying to think hard but nothing comes out. I know we are young (32 & 30) BUT for the past 4.5 years since we got engaged, even worse when we found out I was pregnant which he was onboard and we had tried for several months… He just got worse, his excuse was I can fend for myself. I have tried every different approach, suppressed my emotions, gave benefit of doubt, placed blame on myself to fix it and start over…. Nothing! it is the same pattern. Some where in me, I believe we could have a happy healthy marriage. I’m very realistic when it comes to relationships, I understand no two people are the same and compromise, take steps back to move forward, you fall in and out of love , it takes hard compassionate work…. I’ve noticed he is not like this around his parents especially his mother. I’ve also noticed that he is never given the opportunity to take responsibility or express full emotion when around them. It’s like I’m a third wheel! my daughter and I come last. The better of a wife I become, the better of a mother, the more I better myself the more he becomes distant as if he really doesn’t want this marriage. He has never Said that though even when given opportunities. Lately, endless opportunities. I’m not perfect and have my faults as a person but I have done tremendous growth and soul searching to gain more compassion and have more empathy. I am having a hard time with the advice given, accept him for who he is or leave. I can’t right now. I can’t stay in a relationship and suppress my emotions or look at him and not want better for him. As well as leave, on a certain level it’s silly. We don’t fight about “normal” marriage stuff. Jealousy, sexual commitment, finances, parenting style… We don’t fight/argue about those. Granted he is not the most forth coming when it comes to a plan of action generally it’s me that has to come up w a plan or goal but I even askbefore a decision is made, what do you think, any input, how do you feel…???? How do you cope with this without leaving or losing your integrity, values while staying? I’m exhausted

Has your life changed in 5 years?

I’ll assume that’s a rhetorical question?
She was obviously malleable and eager to fix things.  She probably hung in there.  She’s probably so broken now that she can’t even respond to inquiries.  That’s the outcome of trying to “work a one sided relationship” with a “man child”.
Just facts.

Lately, endless opportunities. I’m not perfect and have my faults as a person and in this relationship but I have done tremendous growth and soul searching since our daughter was born bc I wanted to make sure we gave her the ultimate opportunities for emotional and physical growth. I am having a hard time with the advice accept him for who he is or leave. I can’t right now. I can’t stay in a relationship and suppress my emotions or look at him and not want better for him. As well as leave, on a level it’s silly. We don’t fight about “normal” marriage stuff. Jealousy, sexual commitment, finances, parenting style… We don’t fight/argue about those.

You can’t meet his needs bc he is broken inside and no one can heal him. He doesn’t even know what or how he can be helped, all he knows is he is not happy. But you cannot heal him. And men typically don’t want to accept they are flawed and put in the therapy work. What I do with my PA is recognise that this is what he is. It comes from unmet emotional needs and childhood damage etc etc. he doesn’t do it deliberately. He does it out of instinct and survival and it’s very immature but they don’t know any other way to keep “in control”. Men want to be in power and have control – that’s how they are born. And they just do this behaviour as a natural instinct bc they can’t think of a more mature and evolved way of behaving – like women do! Try and focus on the good things about your husband. Realise he is not necessarily able to “be different” and won’t accept he has issues. But the truth is that we all have issues. You do too and they play out in different ways that you prob aren’t aware of. Living with someone is really hard for everyone. Few people are happily married and it’s always hard work and full of compromises and learning to understand your partner and how to work with them not against them. It’s going to conintue, the PA behaviour, but what can change is your perspective and seeing it for what it is rather than questioning yourself.  Even knowing your husband is PA often makes people feel a lot better. Just keep working on it and don’t give up so young. Get some therapy for yourself to help you keep on track.

Well put  he’s broken inside , I will use that thought in future and I know I can’t mend him but it’s so hard to think he’s got everything about me wrong I know I’m a nice person and if there was a another person that  could hear how he talks to me they would be shocked , I don’t like to be told by him that I’m not good enough for him when he is disrespectful to me and a lot of people .

men? don’t make this a sex thing. My wife is passive agressive, by you turning it to say “all men don’t blah blah” makes you sound like an evil PA sexiest .

Wow: I have read your testimony. I feel like you wrote my life with my now ex-husband. I could take it anymore. He sucked all the joy out of my life. I to feel if he were to change I would take him back. Im not counting on it though. The one most crazy behaviors my ex husband had was. If I asked he him anything, his response was always NO. He meant Yes.  In his head Yes was always the answer. Then a fight would occur cuz I could never understand the NO. He would say I never said that. So on and so on. I would turn and mouth to myself WTF. I was loosing who I was. I thought I was going crazy. My third child just graduated from high school. I feared what my life would have been like with just us. I did meet a man. I enjoyed his conversation a lot. Because it was normal. I did try for a year to get him to understand how I was feeling. I went online, read books, went to therapist, pastors. After awhile I could tell he had no interest. The covert abuse was rampant. I just ended the marriage. I feel stuck in my feelings. This was not what I wanted for myself. The is so much more. I feel I could write a book. It was an extremely hard decision. Good luck

Hopefully you’ve found your footing by now.  Yes, good partners are forced to seek “emotional and even physical sustenance” elsewhere beyond their primary relationship. Because at home it’s just silent treatment, stone walls and barren landscape.  It’s literally torture at home.

I read your history and thought you were describing my story. HOWEVER: my now ex-husband stopped having sex with me 20 years ago; stopped sleeping in the same room with me 16 years ago; lied about working; criticized my job (I supported the family x 24 years); stopped doing things as a family 8 years ago; started biking 6 years ago and forgot that he had a family; has not worked FT in 16 years; consulted even though his financial contribution was bare bones; belittled me in front of our daughter and his friends for years. Now we are divorced and he has yet to move his personal belongings out of the house; the basement and garage areas remain in a hoarding state. What my question is: WHY would I stay married to a person who is neither a man; a father or a husband for 24 years? Is it because we had a child? This male person was NOT a provider for his family; a mooch; a person who was not able to provide spiritual/ emotional/ intimacy/ financial efforts to a marriage.

I only say this out of empathy for you.  Get out of the marriage.  He isn’t EVER going to change.  Best predictor of his future behavior is looking at his past.  In all this time he isn’t even  willing to admit he has a problem.  I hate divorce-been thru it twice-I would never recommend it-but in your case I am sorry.  For your own happiness and sanity-GET OUT!  GET OUT! GET OUT! of your marriage.  Go find the happiness you deserve, it starts with getting out.

I would be very careful NOT to tell anyone to break up their marriage or their home, or their current existence.  Everyone’s situation is different.  Many of these situations are not only tolerable, but they can be improved upon.

I think I have a passive aggressive partner. I always thought it had been me through the years, or at least that’s what she’d tell me whenever I’d complain about something which I thought was inappropriate, and I believed her. So I’d read books, try self improvement courses, even visited and did CBT. 

I believed her because when she met she always said she’d never lied EVER, so I respected her opinion. Only years later did tell me, she used to lie about things to upset me. Though she now denies she said that!

I didn’t do any of these “self-help” things before, it all started about 5-6 years of marriage, I used to be a normally happy guy. But since then I’ve had two break-downs (my own fault because I tried to play her at her own game, which just ended up as guilt and feeling bad for me BIG MISTAKE). And I now have no friends, I’ve been virtually removed from my family circle and I rarely see them, talking about them seems to raise an eyebrow and a dismissive ‘oh your family’. 

And I’m constantly told it’s actually all my fault, I’m the one who had the break down. I’ve no doubt some is, but all of it?

I came from a very lovey family environment. We had problems of course, but hugging and generally sharing feelings was the norm. I thought that’s how it would be with my wife, but I feel foolish, hurt and I regret ever meeting  her, but at the same time I love her!! She is a great mother, and at times a great wife. 

Apart from the standard always 15-20 minutes late I get if I need a lift. I’m not willing to share too many things (there are a lot), but the biggest kick in the face for me was supposedly not performing well in bed. Then being told it’s not the best compared to others. The next day I confronted her on it and thought it was hurtful. “It was a joke, jesus, can’t you take a joke? That’s your problem, you just can’t take a joke. And what about all the things you say to me” on which I get a list on why I’m actually not a great person before going off in a huff because I’m getting angry (which is true, I used to rise to it). I’m the one then who ends up apologizing and still feeling frustrated because I got my feelings hurt without any acknowledgement:-S On this occasion, it was just that she’d been tired, so instead of just telling me that , I get punished with something I found quite hurtful. Even if it’s not true. Or is it? I’m not sure anymore. I just don’t have any confidence in myself to say ‘It’s like this?’ in fact, I’m already feeling guilty/nervous for sharing this.

Sorry, none of this really makes sense. I just feel a bit down today and I wanted to write it down somewhere.

Hey, At least you can get it off your chest, think about what makes you breathe again, to breathe again and be yourself.

I hope that you’ve survived this toxic witch.
That bit about not good in bed not as good as others was not a joke at all.  That was intentionally cruelty on her part and essentially it was her admitting to her infidelity. She’s probably so confident at this point, because she’s doing it so much and you have probably picked up on it but you’re totally trauma bonded and in denial too, that she just hit you with it right on the chin.  That was just evil.  Then to minimize it and claim that you’re just unable to take a joke just too sensitive?  !!!!  WTF?    No.  She’s an absolutely covert malignant narcissistic psychopath.  There is no love or respect in what you describe.  She is literally “Just An Asshole”!  And she’s probably had various strange mens cocks in her asshole too!
If they get away with their evil long enough… they often resort to such offhanded jokes. It’s literally their way of mocking you.
Similar story.  Mine claimed that I take too long to cum from oral sex, which she claimed to like doing.  She made a passing comment about how “Other guys don’t take that long to cum from oral”!  It was a same for same situation.  Ultimately I lost all respect for her and then I had no problems cumming in her mouth!  Guess what?  She then lost interest in giving oral sex because it was no longer an angle that she could use to make me feel like shit about myself.  What she liked most about oral sex was opportunities to make me feel like I was a failure.  My problem wasn’t inability to perform.  That’s never a problem that I have had.  My problem was loving and respecting this POS.  Once I accepted her as a toxic, undermining, deceitful, manipulative POS… I enjoyed having her swallow and shooting on her face etc….  And then, no surprise, since the dynamics had changed, and since she did not want to give me pleasure(fact afterall), she suddenly lost all interest in oral sex!
I hope that you can laugh at all of this by now.  They really are completely malevolent.  I don’t mean to be harsh here in this graphic, because I do love and respect women.  It’s just an absolute waste of time applying that to this type of creature.  There’s no winning it or joy in these relationships… it’s not in the cards.  They are T O X I C.

Simon
Thanks. You saved me trying to describe the contradictions of my relationship with my PA wife & my sanity perhaps. As I am trying to play my wife at her own PA game & going nuts.
I wish I didnt love her so much. I’m in trouble! lol or should that be Sh*******!

It’s not possible or even a good idea to try and play them at their own game.  You can not possibly do so if you are neurotypical.  You don’t think like they do.  You have feelings.  It’s quintessentially like going up against a professional firing squad with spit wads.  Even if you hit them in the eyes, you are still DEAD, and they’re none the worse for it.
Running far and fast and going no contact is the only win you’ll ever get with these types.  It’s your own sanity.

I’m 68 and have had a screwed up life.  I’m not looking for sympathy. I’m beyond that.  I’m writing about my feelings, because I have been fooling myself with the thought of being a reasonably decent person, never intentionally setting out to cause angst.  It is said everyone is looking for love.  I have no memory of experiencing love as a child.  I came from a dysfunctional family, and find it difficult to relate to love within relationships. My father’s nerves were shot with nervous anxiety on his return from WWII.  He was a hard working man but totally devoid of emotion.  My mom wore the “pants” around the house, and was the voice to be heard. Although quick to anger, I do recall  an infrequent display of  love or kindness.  My father didn’t row.  It was mom who usually hysterically shouted at dad. This has allowed me to develope a rather jaundiced outlook on women, as confrontational beings. It had been many years later when I realised her outbursts were out of sheer frustration with dad.   I never had any girl friends, in spite of being well built six footer.  There was nine years between me and my older brother. He too had his emotional problems and left home at 18 years old.  He was a good brother to me and I can remember thinking to myself as a nine year old, that I will never see him again.  I was right.   He remained a bachelor until his death at age 51.   My first wife walked out on me for her new found love after 12 years of marriage, and left me with my 12 year old son. She had a long string of broken relationships before she met me.  She did not have a loving relationship with her own dad.  In hind site this was probably a recipe for disaster from the word go, as we married only six weeks after first meeting.  I think we both confused lust with love from the outset.  A few months after my divorce I met my second (current) wife at a divorce & separates club.  Her husband died and left her with two young kids.  We were both lonely, and miserable, so we threw in together, to try and make a better life.  We too married shortly after meeting.  Bringing up her two and my one, was a challenging nightmare.  Nobody really got on well together.  I was emotionally ill equipped to deal with    such a scenario. I struck my own son once for being out of line and immediately regretted it, and never laid a hand on anyone else since.  They are grown up now. My blood  son has a family of his own, but both step kids are in there 30’s and still single and are avowed to remain that way.  My wife has always been hyper-sensitive, and has suffered with agoraphobia for the last 20 years. It was triggered by a car accident we were both in.  In short there hasn’t been many laughs or good times, but I shouldn’t complain as many others are far worse off.  I must count my blessings.

I just wanted to say that I admire your strength through difficult times and how you still count your blessings despite it all. That’s what I try to do too. It was eight years ago that you posted your message, I hope you are well now and life is treating you better. I’m struggling a bit myself at the moment hence why I’m reading everyone’s posts. I won’t leave my partner because I love my cat too much! Just a bit of advice for anyone thinking of leaving….I’ve done it once after an 18 year marriage and it’s not necessarily going to fix anything. If you do leave stay alone for a few years to find your feet and get to know yourself better, don’t go straight into a new relationships like I did. I have found myself in another difficult situation with someone selfish, hypocritical and irritable.

Wow…legit complaints from me are met by ” I never do anything right”….or….”you always want to argue”…. Or ….”I didn’t know”….or….”you are perfect but I’m not”…. Or….”that’s my business don’t worry about it”….or “why are you bringing that up” or………etc…..dishes sit in the sink for four days…but it’s my fault for making dishes when I cook…..laundry sits in and on the dryer but it’s, “thorn why don’t you take them out”….but she did the laundry….student loans in default after she waited for seven years to address the issue although I told her that procrastinating would led to default and effect our ability to buy a home….her response….why are you bringing up the past…..wtf do I do?…. I’m frustrated and ready to cash out?

In the exact same boat, sounds JUST like my wife. WOW. I’m thinking about whether to cash out now as we’re about to buy a house together

Woke up today to wet glasses stacked on top of wet dishes….wet containers stacked on wet containers…clothes stacked on dryer…all things discussed ad nauseim. Wish I would have paid more attention before having a child with her…I would be out otherwise.

Only a passive aggressive person would counter every point and reverse everything. A discussion on how she treats me as a man and projects her anger onto me is countered with “you leave dirty spoons on the counter.”  Idiot.

Wow! I read the help for passive aggressive couples and how to help him. The advice is to give him more down time and praise him for what he does do. Honey, I’ve tried the praise routine. I’ve given him space to relax and decompress an do what needs to get done at his leisure. He never gets done. Right now I am looking at my lawn that hasn’t been mowed in two weeks. I haven’t mowed it, which I normally do just because it has to get done and isn’t worth the hassle. I’ve suggested it. I have said nothing and still it’s like anything else. It doesn’t get done. 

We were working on paving stones two weeks ago. Of course it has to be done with me here or he won’t do it. I praised him, said wow don’t you feel good, isn’t it amazing and so forth. It still isn’t finished because it’s waiting for him to cut some stones. He only worked part time this week as in 16 hours, I worked two jobs. Plus housework. And I still managed to lay down some of the stones.

Ok sorry, some of that is venting. Seriously, this man is making me crazy. He’s 48 years old. I have no clue he can’t hold a job, he can’t do the most basic of household chores, I am lucky if he feeds the dogs which is about the only thing I can count on. Putting out water for them is a 50/50. It’s like living with a preteen and I don’t have children. But I have heard from people and have lots if nieces and nephews to hear those conversations. 

Here’s my thoughts grow up and put on your big boy pants or please get out. He’s making me sick. I am tired and I can’t keep up the pace. I have to clean up after him too. Plus work all the time.

Get out now cos it only will get worse and your health will suffer.

My husband and I have known each other for over 20 years.  When we met as teenagers, (What do teenagers know, right) I thought he was my soulmate.  He was so gentle, kind and considerate.  His sole purpose was to make me happy, and I felt the same way.  Now, it seems like he is a different person.  It’s always someone else’s fault; He can’t take criticism; He will say one thing, do another and then defend how I either interpreted what he said or what he did wrong.  It is frustrating and heartbreaking to deal with this type of confusion and uncertainty and he seems to be totally ambivalent to the situation.  This leads me to question whether he really loves me or is just playing some sort of emotional hokey pokey with my feelings.  Almost like he is testing me to see how much I can endure before calling it quits, so he can cluelessly say “What happened.”  ” I had no idea you were so unhappy.”  ” Did I do something to make you feel this way.”  I’m so confused because I feel this is not the person that I fell in love with.  To his credit, we have gone to several counselors; however, things will get better for a week and then he reverts back to his old behaviors.  I’m emotionally exhausted.  Thanks for listening and letting me vent.

It sounds like he is depressed. He may or may not know why. He may well be a different person to who you married bc we were all young and full of hope and ambition. At his age he’s reached his peak. He has to accept that and maybe that’s hard. Maybe he takes it out on you. But it doesn’t mean it’s your fault or anything to do with you. We can’t fix other people. They have to do it themselves and men rarely do. Just look after yourself. Find your own happiness. Just don’t flaunt it in front of him. Use humour to relax tense situations.

As I read all of your responses, the one resounding thought in my head is “my god, they are describing my wife to a TEE!”.  Ive been married for 13 years now, and have 2 young children.  In the beginning my wife was affectionate, loving, and fun to be with.  We lived together for a year before we got married.  It was literally from the day after we were wed that her passive aggressive behavior started.  After our wedding she stopped holding my had, we took both our immediate families out to dinner and she sat her niece in between us.  The I noticed that she began to with hold sex, stopped touching me, and never talked with me about anything.  The she started giving me an attitude whenever I asked her to do anything, and even managed to screw up even the most menial task.  When I tried to express my feelings, I would me wet with either a blank stare, rolling of the eyes, or she would simply stare off to the side and say nothing, or “whatever”. I was going crazy because I could not figure out what the problem was.  We went to couples therapy, and all of a sudden she was a waterfall of emotion, where I was the bad guy, and she told lie upon lie.  I swear, I didn’t know who this women was.  I tried to stick it out after the birth of our 2 children, but things just kept getting worse.  It became clear that she had absolutely no regard for my feelings.  And no matter what I said to her she would either come up with some excuse or blame me for it.  Nothing was ever her fault. I spoke recently, to a psychologist friend about this and she said that my wife seems like an extreme passive aggressive.  I didn’t know exactly what a passive aggressive was until I followed her direction and did some research.  My wife and I have not slept in the same bed in years, we have zero intimacy, and no communication.  She is also an extreme procrastinator, when we first met she was working on her PHD, 2 years ago I found out that she had let her research lapse to the point where it was no longer valid, I flipped out over that.  I sent her to school to do medical transcription, and she did that for a while until she slacked off and got fired, I paid for her to go back to college to get a teaching degree, only to find out that she had taken the last 3 semesters off.  Having finally seen the futility of trying to change her or work things out I have decided that my mental health and sanity must come before my desire to keep my family together, and am now seeking a divorce.

You are making the right decision. I wish I had done the same, It will drain you to the point of no longer caring about anything.

I am sorry your journey has been so painful. I hope understanding these dynamics will console you a little bit.

Wow, I can not believe what I am reading.  It fits my husband to a T.  Ive been married almost 20 years , and have been confused and upset for so long.  Just knowing I”m not crazy helps.

I, too, am in this situation with my husband. I’ve spent the last 10 years battling him, and I’m so tired. I slipped into a deep depression. I went on medication to help me deal with passive suicidal ideation. My physical health has deteriorated. Now I just want him out. I feel guilty because I think he will honestly end up homeless, but I can’t let my 7 year old daughter grow up thinking this is normal. At least now I might be able to stop questioning myself: my perceptions, my observations, my motivations, and my sanity–all because he refuses to acknowledge that *he* might have a problem. Thank you for that. Thank you to all you beautiful people who shared your stories. I am absolutely overwhelmed to know that I am NOT crazy, and it’s not “just me”.

It’s NOT you, and what you can do is give up the BATTLE.  When I gave up my battle with my husband’s problems and turned Him and His Problems over to God, things got “much better” in my life.  Try it, you’ll see.  You will regain strength and you will find joy in the simple things in life oncemore.

I thought I was ok. Then my wife forwarded this article to me. She said please read it slowly and take it all in. NOW I realize that I am a PA (perfect asshole). This is probably a result of the over critical parental treatment, but I blame myself for not recognizing any of the above. I have always been a good provider, working many years of long hours. I have also often worked at home remodeling, building, etc.  The household chores are another story. It is SO hard to do the redundant tasks required by every household. I have plenty of energy, but It just seems like such an invasion on the few precious free minutes that I get (distorted thinking).
    My wife is a dear soul who does not deserve any of the treatment mentioned above in various comments. Life brings enough challenges without dealing with my BS every day. Omitting the detail, the things I just read are way too familiar in our relationship. We are currently involved in couples counseling, but now I feel that I should be seeking individual help. Our marriage will surely benefit if I can change. Bless her heart for putting up with me this long. Thank you for the article and postings, in helping me to be aware of my own behavior.

Wow lucky lady and good on you Fred  woman like your wife only want you to be happy and she needs to know that you value her  , hope it all works out for you both .

Fred,
That is a very sweet post.  Can you talk to my husband? : )

So much unhappiness on this page. I came looking for answers, but I think I’ve found more questions. Is my partners behavior P/A? (Silent treatment, “No don’t, I’ll do it as usual”, constant criticism, lack of intimacy, sleeping in separate rooms, an underlying anger, never saying sorry or admitting wrong, never saying anything positive etc). Now I’m wondering is mine? (Always been really defensive to criticism, hate sound of arguing, showing frustration and anger, throwing arms up in the air, feeling unappreciated / unloved).

Background 2 people 2nd marriages mid forties, met 5 years ago. Her boy 17, girl 14, me son 9 and our daughter 2. Me loud gregarious Mediterranean teacher, her quiet shy stunning looking very English para-legal. She has big intimacy issues with her dad, i had a childhood of loving but constant criticism from mine. 

She hates the son I adore, who stays every fortnight, says its his fault for being nasty and not doing what she says when I’m out of earshot. Everyone else thinks he’s polite and sweet boy.She also angry at me for not being punishing him enough or dealing effectively with his very difficult mother. He is not allowed to eat with us, or be in same room as her. Her 2 children; nice kids I love them, but they seem to break rules with impunity until she gets really angry at them. I feel they are molly coddled, we run round after them, they have no chores, renage on  any responsibilities given to them. 

When questioned I feel like I am being cross examined in the dock. If I raise any issues  about the kids or her, she gets aggressive, gets even more angry, if I try to walk away. I am therefore pushed until I snap. Not violent, but I’m not nice when red mist descends. Resulting in me getting days of cold shoulder/silence / stone face from someone who is not very warm at best of times.

Are we both P/A? Are we just a bad combo? Can we change or are we doomed?
Any advice or help?
Lost dazed and confused.

I’m so wanting a years later update on this!

Hrmm… I feel people are making a lot of assumptions here. I don’t want to sound too passive agressive, because I know I have some problems with that, but sometimes we need to ride ourself of emotion by doing something constructive before pointing the finger so directly at someone else other than yourself. No one can really controle how you feel. What you think is mainly a cause of your own feelings and hurt. Pointing the finger at your partner and not talking directly to them about actual scenarios and turning to a website instead seems a bit passive agressive. Everyone can act passive agressive at times. It seems easiar to divert the attention to something other than the issue at hand rather than deal with it right there and then. Lay out precise observations on truths table. Don’t slam the truth in the face of your loved ones or anyone. The truth speaks for itself. If they are passive agressive then they’ll tell you that that’s your opinion or that you are the one distorting the truth. I’m going to have to think and pray real hard on this. I’m not sure how to approach my wife, I am scared, but it feels good. She shows some chronic signs, but mostly in communication, where I have realized, by all your help, im greatful to you all, that I may be that typical male passive agressive. I’ll tell you one thing, I’m not going to consider it a disease or anything, but I do believe its contagious. Id like to challenge all of us involved to be more assertive now, don’t wait a single moment longer. Anger is a good way to get the dishes done. And if your spouse decides to do them this time, for god sake and theirs, don’t criticize how they do it, just say thank you sooo much. But don’t seem so cheesy like something is up or have anger when you say it and not tell them, because that makes you the passive aggressive. In fact, if you do feel the anger rolling out as they finally did the dishing, you should say, OMG! I’m so glade Im furious!  If they ask you why, then you made a break through, and if you don’t tell them the truth, then you are in fact passive aggressive. It is okay to argue!  Its healthy!  Just DO NOT yell!  Passive aggressive people love to get your goat by setting off emotional triggers so they can blame you for their Anger as it is now yours. Just keep in mind!  They did not do that to you!  You did it to yourself!  You are in charge of your own emotional well being. Unattatching yourself from that and finding something else or someone else to blame for it is passive aggressive behavior. Sorry about any grammar or spelling..I’m not even going to re-read it…just send it into the whirl wind. Thanks again to all, but I have to say to some who are sounding like nasty complainers, grow some you know what!  You better get tough now. Your emotional well being is yours. Be a rock. Read up on co-dependency issues. If you haven’t heard and you think you are except, then you are in for more of a ride than with this subject.  Also, don’t blow your mind online. That’s messed up. Everyone has very real and freakish issues they have to deal with, what counts is how we deal with them. Character is made that way, when all the good times have to be preserved in pictures.  Have a total fantastic thrill ride.  Out with plastic peace and oneness bull crape, in with healthy anger exercises and division to personal uniqueness. Life hurts and that’s what saves us.

Dealing with a PA spouse is not hard because of a certain negative action or inaction from the PA spouse. But it is hard because of the “repetitiveness” of that negative action or inaction from the PA spouse, to a point that drives the victim spouse either nuts or greatly depressed. Make no mistake; It’s the repetitiveness of the action, and not just the mere action itself. You love your PA spouse. And your love to them makes you unable to believe that they’re really dysfunctional enough to be actually meeting your love with aggression! .. The PA spouse is acting like if they were an enemy spy planted in your house, hellbent on annoying you and hurting you in every subtle way they can. And as spies; the PA spouse never admits their sabotage. They will drain all your resources (money, friends, happiness, sanity, etc.) until you’re done for good, and then they will move on to the next victim. They will occasionally show you love, real love, just to reel you in, especially when you seem about to escape their spell, or their world altogether. After all, who doesn’t love a resource which is at hands-reach, and can be drained almost indefinitely?!.. They will promise to change, and they sometimes will really mean it at the time. But when you’re back together, they will return back to their old ways soon enough. After all, how can they fight the temptation of leaving this resource (you) untapped while this resource is -once again- available to them like that?!.. You fear leaving them, because the price is too high. You feel that you will lose a whole life.. you will lose all those good memories you had together.. you will lose all the effort you have already put in this relationship.. you will be turning your back on years of your life, and -with some people- financial support, and maybe even kids in the process too. You’re simply in a position in which you’re being bullied, by a loved one, and not for your lunch money, but for your sanity and your life itself!!

If anyone would give us (victims of PA spouses) a piece of advice; then please put the description of our feelings above into your consideration. We’ll owe you great thanks.

I think the best advice we can give each other is to seek to comfort ourselves within these difficult situations.  Help the other person if we can.  Pray for them.  Develop positive attitudes in spite of the hurt and pain we are experiencing.  Tomorrow is another day and it DOES get better.

Being bullied. That’s a great way of putting it. I didn’t think of it that way til I read that in your comment.

I’m thinking you may have a few more problems with passive aggressive then you totally understand.

Yes, amazing how the passive aggressive husband is loved by everyone except those who know him well. He has no close friends and even his counselors seem to tire of him fairly quickly. He never calls then complains about me not calling. He is an excellent provider, but negative or absent emotionally. He either naps or pretends he doesn’t hear you. He stares into the distance much of the time and shrinks up like he’s being injured if you scream in frustration. He never screams. He rarely talks. In fact, he seems pleased to display no emotion although you can sense how angry and/or resentful he is. When he does tasks, he makes sure to screw them up or ask you a thousand questions. How many ways can you cut vegetables??? I only have about two answers for questions like this. Over the years, I’ve defaulted to, “Cut them the way you want to eat them”.  On the tasks where I do specify, he makes sure to not do it. Then, he gets really defensive when I ask him why. I know he’d rather I didn’t ask him to do anything at all, but, then, he seems bored if he’s not disappointing me somehow. The oddest part about all of this is that I can tell that he loves me, and that he is just duplicating how his mother behaved. His father angers easily and screams at anyone for anything at an incredible volume. However, I screamed maybe once a month during the first years of our marriage and once I finished professional school (and the stress was much lower), maybe once every three months. In other words, there is no need for him to feel he must withdraw into silence and play ignoring games with me. However, I know he did it for years with people at work, too. He finally seemed to figure out that it might be related to his lack of promotion to a new title. Now, I’m trying to get him to see that he’s just copying his parents relationship in his mind….that there is no need for him to torture himself. After all, he despises his parents, so I hope he can see what he is turning around onto me. BTW, I am currently in full rebellion mode. After 12 years of marriage and 15 years together, I have gotten sick of doing everything in the house and him taking no responsibility. What makes me angriest is that he will sit quietly (yawning or looking very bored) even when we are out in public, trying to have a date, even though he had earlier said he wanted to go. We don’t even bother with vacations. So, I’ve let the house and the cooking and the trying to have a good date and the intimacy all fly out the window. Shockingly, it seems to be getting through to him. Will it last? Wish us luck. I long for that man I knew for eight years who was so enjoyable.

Sounds like asd.

Wow. Just wow.I totally understand. 

From a personal standpoint, I just wish there was a solution. I hoped for so much more than this. I wish for more for my husband. It just seems for all intents and purposes we should really be living a beautiful life but instead THIS. I showed him a PA post yesterday, he became defensive and derisive of course and felt attacked. I don’t want to give an account of all of his characteristics. You can read any of the comments above for that. I guess I just wish that showing him this would lead to a better life for us, but I have to admit I’m wondering what punishment be will follow up with. It’s so sad for each party involved. I just wish things could be different, but my hope has dwindled and this situation is starting to wear me down. I’m sad, disappointed, disillusioned and also upset with myself for getting myself into this type of relationship.

Wow Ana!  You just described the relationship I have with my husband!  We are in the middle of divorcing after almost 36 years of marriage.  He was my best friend and I loved him dearly.  But he made a choice to be angry and harbor resentment towards me about so many things.  Things I am just now learning he was angry about.  I want to stay together, but I would have to give up myself and my wants, needs, and dreams to do so.  I have changed over the years from being an outgoing, fun, productive, active person to a shell of my former self from all the comments and demeaning actions, not to mention the utter lack of respect, support or encouragement.  He says that he understands what he has done and that he wants to change.  My heart wants to believe him but my head says I can’t.  The trust is shattered and I am scared about my future on my own.  But I truly believe the only way to save myself is to continue with the divorce.  Do others feel this way?  Has anyone stayed and been able to successfully change the situation for the better?  Do you have to constantly point out the passive aggressive behavior?  I am not sure I could do that for the rest of my life.

I’m still starting on this journey of understanding. Not entirely sure of why things are as they are, but do know it’s not right – ie meeting my needs and desires, as opposed to his. 27 yrs married, effectively living separately for last 15 because of my job, and he’d been ‘supportive’ on the surface. But I’m beginning to realise that his reluctance to move with me, despite the fact he has given up his business and has not actively sought work in my location owes as much to his PA as to anything else. I’ve found it damaging to my self esteem – why wouldn’t my husband want to spend time with me? – and hugely unsettling.  I spend all my time trying to appease him and make sure he is happy. It’s all surfaced again because he resents my family inheritance and is now demanding I spend money on him. I don’t really care about the money but he clearly does. I suppose I should have seen it coming and am annoyed with myself that I let this happen. But I’m thinking maybe this is more about self preservation – not having critical comments, sacarstic remarks, silent treatment, and other undermining stuff will be such a relief.

My husband is two different person, when he is good everything is great, he is responsible and helpful, once he becomes angry (every 2 months)his face changed, in every fights wants divorce, and completely humiliate me, I don’t know why I start to cry and ask him to stay, usually it takes one to two hours, then he accepted and again the cycle starts. Very good moments and suddenly for nothing just a short argument we go to hell and he wants divorce.Should I accept divorce?

Just like mine he creates arguments when he’s fed up with life and somehow it’s all my fault , the divorce threat comes out and says he can’t live  like this and he’s not going to put up with it , he starts the arguments I defend myself from his insults he’s just accusing me of and then bingo I’m the one who is the problem in his eyes when I haven’t done anything wrong at all , it’s so soul destroying .

Play the game. Accept the divorce verbally and he will punish you by upping the anti. He will pack his bags, he will storm around the house, he will be a nightmare. But don’t fall for it. 

If you have a general idea of the pattern then you have time to plan. 

I’m telling you this because I used to do this. And one day she just let me walk out the door. Not only did she not beg me to stay, she left the house before I could reap the benefits of that torturous hour I didn’t have a audience for while slamming closet doors. She definitely pulled the trump card.

I left but returned the next morning. I was going to go back the same night but there is no pleasure in letting her think she won, even if it’s only for one night. 

25 years later and we are still together, happily . ONLY because she stood her ground.

I have been married to my husband for 39 years. He had convinced me I was crazy then 3 1/2 years ago we had a huge fight over his family and their behavior and he said unforgiveable things to me and then a week later told me I was crazy because he never said these things. I know I am an idiot for putting up with his behavior for 35 years but I finally took a good long look at our life and problems and starting researching online to see if other people we’re going thru similar things a5nd there it was-the extreme passive aggressive.  He cannot tell the truth about anything-even something as simple as “did you fill up the dogs water”. He uses what I have always called hostile humor which I believe is a way for him to be hateful and then pretend that He was just joking.  He has always lied about money. I was so glad when employers went to direct deposit because he couldn’t lie about his paycheck anymore. If I ask him to do something he will either do it halfway or say he will get around to it (which means not in this lifetime). He will not start any chore unless I am there to help. If I ever say anything critical to him he will get furious or ignore me and walk away. The worst thing is he says mean and nasty things to me and when I confront him about what he said he will circle his finger by his head and say I am crazy because he didn’t say anything or he didn’t say it the way I think or he was joking and I can’t take a joke or he will just walk away. I have a list of reasons/excuses he uses (and so does his entire family) when he has something really hateful and he realizes it has upset me or someone. 1) I only said that because I care 2)I was only joking-can’t you take a joke 3) you misunderstood what I said 4) I didn’t say that the way you took it 5) you must be crazy because I didn’t say that at all.  I know he  had a supercritical verbally abusive father and a mouse of a mother who never allowed her kids to express their emotions in case it made dad angry or failed to protected the kids when dad did get angry. I believe his mother was passive aggressive and taught this behavior to her kids (one is a mouse like her, one is a lesbian and hates men and the other one is a drug addict/drug dealer). I have tried talking calmly to my husband, I have tried rationalizing with him, I have cried and ranted and screamed, and nothing gets thru to him. I did start reading articles about passive aggression to him and he said he did see some of his behavior talked about in the articles and he will try and change and he will go to couseling and so far he has not done anything he has promised. I was a young sweet kind naive young girl with no self-confidence when I met my husband. My father was an abusive alcoholic and my mother was a codependent enabler who taught me to be a codependent enabler-keep the peace at all costs. I believe my husband recognized me as an enabler and realized I was raised to put up with bad behavior. In fact when I was reading about this to my husband he immediately said that it was my fault that he said and did the things he did because I let him get away with these things. (Can you see where this is going). I quit going around my husbands family years ago because he would never stand up for me when his family was mean and nasty nor allow me to stand up for myself because he didn’t want me to hurt his family feelings (he was not concerned that they had hurt my feelings). Wow! I feel better just getting this off my chest. Not sure what I will do. At 57 I am probably too old to start over but am tired of living with someone who will never change.

Kim – I’m glad you got some of your struggles off your chest.
Your final statement “but am tired of living with someone who will never change” .suggests the next move is up to you. Do you fear living without him is a greater fear than the anguish of living with him?

There is a really good book that may shed even more light on you and your situation. It is called The War of Art. It is a lot about the demons you and your husband are fighting . The author is Steven Pressfield
Good luck

Its never too late to leave them. I have been with my husband for 8 years and married nearly 6. I am 53 I eventually asked him to leave as I was becoming ill with it all. He was also constantly on his phone which led me to think he is also an addict. He wouldn’t do anything and on his days off he would sleep, blaming everybody else except himself. They are also selfish to the core. He couldn’t even get up on a Sunday so we could do things together, He never bothers about me or what he is doing to me. I was signed off work for 2 weeks with depression and he carried on with his own life coming home at 8,30 so he could avoid me and play on his phone. I can’t believe all the things I have gone though are the same as other people.  In 7 weeks he’s been round 6 times and stayed for an hour each time. I changed the locks and his excuse for not coming round…he wasn’t going to stand at the door waiting for me to unlock or open it like Billy no mates. He is at his daughters as the moment and if I ask how it is he says ” not great it’s not where I want to be” tough he should have taken notice, but it can’t be that bad as he’s not coming round here anyway. I think I have also enabled the process and tried to help him by trying to understand him, help him suggest things to him but it is a waste of time and I don’t have anymore to waste on someone who doesn’t care. We have all had lives that weren’t great but we all get on with them and try to make them better but these people want the victim card and maybe they should try to stop playing the victim and get a life..as you are a long time in a box

Sam – your comment about ” I eventually asked him to leave as I was becoming ill with it all.” reminds me of a woman I once worked with – she was in a similar situation as yours and said after I told him to leave and he did, i noticed I didn’t need anti depressants any more. 

There is a price for staying and a price for leaving – the choice of the price is always ours.
Thanks for sharing

After 27 years of marriage and still dancing the same tune only now at age 53 after reading everyone’s testimonials do I honestly see and understand that my husband is PA. He has pushed me to the point of insanity where I have done anything and everything to get a response from him. I have screamed and shouted, I have thrown things, I have attempted suicide, I have even thrown a glass of wine at him as well as hitting him (I am very ashamed and guilty of my behavior). We have 2 older sons in their twenties who have been privy to some of this dysfunctional behavior. We have been for counselling but he always blames me. I feel guilty about myself and any decision I make all the time. I beg him to talk to me and say what he feels and feel what he says and he just looks at me dumbfounded. If I ask him a question, he sees it as a confrontation and withdraws completely. I sleep in the spare room and he comes into the room asking me everyday if I had a good sleep and would I like a cup of tea??? Yet he never every brings up the elephants in the room. He cannot understand why I have withdrawn from him and tells me I am crazy why cant we just move on. I cant anymore as I have done it so many times to my own detriment and when I see him walking down the passage shaking his head and whistling it drives me insane when there are issues to be confronted and talked about. All our friends and my sons think he is such an awesome, positive person and such fun to be around and I of course am seen as the problem. I left a page on PA traits (which I had printed from the internet) next to the kettle for him to read to try and get through to him- he didn’t even acknowledge it or say anything about it but did ask if I would like a cup of tea. I have not had the courage to leave as I always think he will change, up until now I have always believed that I am the problem. He says that he had the best childhood any child could ever have had, he says he never screams or shouts at me, or ever criticizes me which he doesn’t but at the same time I can read him like a book and know that he is thinking something but not saying what he is thinking or feeling. He puts on this act in front of friends that he is a model husband. I am at a total loss within myself as I know he will not change and that I have to find the courage to move on. My self esteem is so low, I live on tranquilizers to get through each day and have now started drinking early in the evening because all I want to do is sleep and not wake up to another day of feeling bad and guilty about me being the person I am.

Wow!!! Im blown away. For most of my 16 years of marriage Ive been concerned that I might have mental issues because I just could not understand what was going on around me and he ALWAYS attacks my character. His favorite saying is …”You don’t have the capacity to…….” You can fill in the blanks there with what ever you like. I am currently on Valium to subdue my panic attacks and I struggle to keep depression at bay. About 2 years ago I contemplated suicide because I went through a severe depression. His mother was living with us at the time, and she too is highly passive aggressive. My mother had just had a heart attach and my father had called for to come asap. They lived about 2 hours flight away from us. My reaction was to immediately ask my mother in law to watch the kids for a couple of days and she flat out said NO…..”I will have a heart attach if I have stay here and watch the kids”…I couldn’t believe it! My husband was out of town on business and I called him to let him know what was happening. He promptly told me that there was other family to take care of my mother and if I should even BOTHER to make alternative arrangements with the kids he would take all my money out of my account so I could not buy a plane ticket. And to top it all off I told him what his mother said and his response to me was…”Well you know how you can be……” What does that even mean!!
 And so my depression began. I have suffered for YEARS. I have fought myself out of that depression and left him for about 6 months to get away from that toxic environment. We are back together but he still hasn’t changed. I know now that I AM NOT CRAZY. And with his mother living with us makes it 100 times worse. I cannot do this ANY LONGER. I am seriously considering divorce. Ive been a stay at home mom most of our marriage. But because he cant keep a job for more than 2 years….which I am now convinced is because of his PA……Ive been working a receptionist job. It doesnt pay much but it feeds our kids and helps with the necessities. He has been out o work for almost 3 years and STILL he says ‘ I dont mean to diminish your job but on your salary we just get by”…..or…” No disrespect but with my salary we would be able to do much more than we do know” Well then keep a job Mr I know it all!!! Im exhausted! Ive been in and out of ER’s, drinking pill after pill for depression and anxiety and the bastard has the audacity to tell me its all in my head! Yes I am angry. Angry for believing that I am the cause of an unhappy  marriage. I feel stifled, like my life has been sucked out of me, no have no energy left. I have no friends because he constantly assuming that Im sleeping with my friends if and when I make friends. I know I have to leave….but Im afraid too

I believe in God, my girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year and a half when she decided to move to Peru to join the Peace Corps. I always knew she was considering going but she did not want to ever talk to me about it, at one point a few months before she left she told me she was leaning towards not going and staying in our hometown. Three weeks before the date she would leave she told me she was going. She told me she was scared to talk to me about it worrying I would react negatively, and that she wanted to stay together during her two year commitment. I felt that ending on good terms and staying in touch would be best for us and our possible future, but I ended up agreeing to stay together. I found myself heartbroken in the month following her departure, and I admit I made the mistake of acting needy and doubtful of our relationship, which she said ended up pushing her away. We broke up for good over a month ago and she told me her feelings have changed due to how I have acted. She asked I give her space and do not talk to her over the app we had been using to text/call. I am going to respect her request but it is hard because I really still love and care for her. I want to know how she is doing. I was worried that by not talking we will grow further apart/if I wait for her she will not talk to me again.Than I have handwritten a few letters explaining my feelings for her.But she never reply, But lucky for me DR IFA was the one who brought my love back to me, he is a good spell caster. his contact address is (drifatomilolaspiritualtmple  @  gmail  .    com, You can still save your marriage or Relationship if really you still love your partner.

I hate my husband. I don’t know how to get him out of my life. He’s a user and passive aggressive. My life is hard. I’m old and tired. My house is a disaster even though I work hard. Life has no reward. I have dreams but no hope.

I can so relate to many of the testimonies.  I am 64 and finally getting a divorce after 40 plus years of marital hell as I describe it.  I am a person that likes reconciliation and restoration.  That doesn’t happen when you are with a PA person.  Anytime you want to address issues, you are treating the person unfairly or get stonewalled or gaslighted and the problem ends up being YOU.  I only recently  figured out what this all was that I was dealing with for decades.  No counseling really helped me to figure it out.  It is emotional abuse that stems from a passive aggressive person.  I could never figure out why I felt nuts all the time.  I always looked like the one out of control because they stay in control ~ that keeps up their facade.  I wanted desperately for the marriage to work and tried and tried but finally now realize it is pretty useless and hopeless and I am burned out to the max and have no desire to live the way I have anymore.  My poor sons had to be witness to all this and there was a time they thought I was the one out of control too but now they are wiser.  I wanted desperately for the man to be free to be a stable and happy man but it is all just wishful thinking and I stayed Far, Far too long.  Should have gotten off the bus many decades ago.  Don’t wait until you are like me and most of your life has passed you by.  If you see no effort on their part to want to change, chances are great it will not happen.

I feel shocked reading your descriptions of PA husbands. So accurate!  I have no way out but I am happy for those of you who can flee.

Many thanks to all of you for your comments,they have given me great insight.
I have been married for 26 yrs to a PA man and have only just realised it.I’m not taking any more of his ‘sabotaging’ behaviour and he knows it!He comes from a broken home,his parents’ divorced when he was very young[5] and to top it off he went to
boarding school in the 70s…bleak emotionally bereft places in England.As soon as the
children came along he changed.They have left home now and it’s just me and him…
I do love him..but he exhibits classic PA behaviour..TEXTBOOK!I don’t want a divorce
even though he’s driving me insane sometimes..I want him to change and I think he is very slowly doing so…so there IS HOPE.In the end change comes from within..he has to want it.Calmly tell them that they are passive aggressive and that you won’t be tolerating such behaviour anymore..it can work.Good Luck.

My ex husband was PA & I lived with his appalling  behaviour for almost 20 yrs before reading something on line about PA & there he was on paper! By this time I had gone through a  mental breakdown & my physical health was dreadful too. I showed him the traits of PA & said “I think you do this”, he read it & said “yes & you don’t know how deep this goes”. This gave me hope that now he knew he would change & stop his appalling behaviour – after all no-one would treat the people they love like that intentionally right? Nope – he decided he didn’t want to stop it & I divorced him. He is now carrying out his nasty little games on his new girlfriend. I want to tell her but she wouldn’t believe me. Our daughter is also suffering as he uses his PA against her too. I’ve had to tell her about PA & how her dad acts to try to give her the tools to protect herself but I know she is feeling very bad. Do not be under any illusion – PAs do not change – they may look like they are but this is just a tactic so they can get your defences down & start it up all over again. The only solution is to leave & have no contact. Run away as fast as you can. My tip is judge a PA by their actions only – ignore everything they say – its all lies. Their actions tell you what they really mean. Good luck to all those suffering with one of these disgusting people – save yourself – you can’t save or change them x

Oh & one more tip – in my case the key phrase was “I forgot” -“I forgot to put the cat net on the cot (again) & the cat nearly smothered the baby”, “I forgot to close the front door & out toddler was nearly killed by a car”, “I forgot to find more work so we have no money”, “I forgot your birthday/anniversary etc etc”.
I now know if I heard the words “I forgot” there was passive aggression happening – for years I had racked my brains to understand how he could “forget” important things yet again. That man recked my life & those of our children. I’m now so happy to be away from all that stress & continual unhappiness.  Btw PAs don’t want to change because they are getting what they want out of the situation which is seeing their victim’s externalise the PAs anger & upset which they are unable to directly express themselves. Don’t expect them to give that up for anyone.

Story of my life. One thing but it’s EXTREMELY important for understanding our exchange with PA spouses: they are definitely not unable (they’re adults just like the other spouse). They’re unwilling to express, and/or unwilling to learn how to express their bad feelings in a healthy way (in any way). It’s just comfy for them to remain clueless about the impact of their behavior, because that way they sleep well as innocent victims of OUR bad emotions (active response to a passive stimulus: our anger ) they don’t have to ’look bad’ in front of their sanctimonious self by expressing those bad emotions. We do it for them as you wrote as well…but let’s be frank about it, their intention is to harm and stay unharmed, and get away with it all – that is why they never do it openly and if you call them on their behavior openly, they deny, deny, deny. That’s why they keep doing this. This lack of intention to change, grow up and stop hurting us is what PA-s will never give up and admit then change…not even when they play along and agree to spend thousands of bucks on couple’s therapy, in vain (because they’ll only need the naive audience of people who want to help the PA and this way the PA can just have more people in front of whom they can victimize themselves…validating their PA toolkit. It works if they get what they want out of everyone: their full attention and validation that THEY are GOOD .)  What they don’t want to accept is the fact that keeping this whole PA stuff up takes a lot more energy and is less rewarding that actually change a little, so in every single situation make a subconscious choice to stay clueless about their behavior and it’s impact, because having a clue would mean they have to use that knowledge, that they’re responsible for how they interact with their environment at all times, and that’s only for adults. They don’t want to grow up, and we’re all enablers, making this possible for them, ruining ourselves for them, trying to reach their mentally unavailable asses, parenting them, when they are happy to remain infants regarding their EQ who are NEVER responsible for their footprint on the world around them, stuck in ages of 3 (I want it now), 5 (I want it but I know it’s inappropriate but still clueless to the impact my fulfillment would have on others, so I sneakily get it then lie about it) and 10 (I want it and I understand why it’s an inappropriate request and also the impact of my fulfillment on others, but I still go for it then lie about it because I don’t care about them). When the spouse grows out of the role of the unsolicited parent and they’re hurting bad and long enough they may move on (if it’s financially possible for them), leaving the PA behind who will never stop thinking of themselves as a victim of an agressive bastard/biach who wanted to change them, fix them continuously. Word.

This!

Living with a passive aggressive personality is indeed frustrating. If you listen to politicians you will notice they often do not respond to the questions asked. They duck, dodge, weave and then respond to the question they wanted you to ask. It is crazy making to the interviewer or viewer. Politicians are trained to do this. Passive aggressive people do it naturally. It is a defense against making emotional contact and the being painfully disappointed when emotional connection and then having it ruptured. Passive aggressive people do not have the resilience to tolerate the connection and inevitable disconnection. Many do not change but some do with sufficient insight and motivation. 

it takes a team effort to make the change.

Wow !!!! I’ve been married almost 2 years and this is so crazy to read , it’s my husband to the t!!!!!!!!! He never apologizes or takes reaponsabilitu for his mean selfish behavior, he always procrastinates, never gets stuff done, has so much potential so I hope he’ll change but he doesn’t care to reach it Bc he doesn’t like to set goals. He hates planning or committing to doig anything.

I’ve cried almost everyday Bc If he decides Im annoying (usually over nothing) , he will punish me by silent treatment after insulting me and getting mad at me and blaming me when really he’s the one at fault. If i ask him to plz do something he promised he’ll do he feels attacked even if i do it with love and if i don’t bring it up then he won’t do it either so either way I’m screwed.

Everyone loves him but I know the real mean him.
He cheated on me at first on chatting apps, then with escorts and got us in HuGe debt Bc of being a sugar daddy as if we had money. He thinks he’s so amazing and just the most amazing at everything and better than everyone at most things.

If we disagree or he’s annoyed we can never problem solve Bc he just withdraws , he says stuff like ugh go away ur so annoying , and even says stuff like he doesn’t care about me or if I leave 

🙁 so much pain

Oh my god, I could have written this. “Thinks he’s amazing and better than everyone at everything” – to a tee! Sounds like you’re dealing with a covert narcissist like I have been the last 10 years. Wishing you the best & hope you get out of there.

PA’s are emotionally stunted train wrecks…lol!!

T R U T H .

I think that one of the things that needs to be discussed on pages like this is also the possibility of getting the heck out.  Unfortunately I’ve got 2 kids with my husband and am not sure if it is in their interests or not for me to stay.  They may be better off if we stay together than split.  I recently had to spend two months out of town dealing with my parents’ significant health needs.  While I was gone, my husband sort of kept things running (he doesn’t have a job so it isn’t like he is busy with other things, either).  Hmmm.  Building a raised bed for strawberries?  Sure, but then instead of pulling the sod out he just leaves it in, making for dozens of hours of extra work for me.  I would have been able to do it myself.  Oh, and while he did that, he conveniently “forgot” to take the kids to 4H.  He watched my dogs, but then when a puppy got sick, gosh darn it, it just didn’t cross his mind to call the vet, so my puppy died.  He mowed the lawn, but pretended not to see all of the raspberry plants he destroyed instead of mowing around them.  He kept the chickens fed and watered, but gee, when the new chicks from the hatchery started dying, it just didn’t cross his mind to call the vet and see what was going on; rather, I had to blow my top at him before he did that (turns out it was Marek’s disease).  And so on.  Doesn’t take the initiative to get the kids enrolled in ANY extracurricular activities, and then complains and whinges on when I take the initiative to do so.  “Forgets” that I had our youngest kid in flute lessons.  Lets the house (in my absence) turn into the sort of filth pile from which social services snatches the kids, and then I become the bad guy when I come home after 2 months out of town and get angry when I see piles of dirt mixed with shedding dog hair and torn up paper all over the house.  Gets the kids fed, but when daughter comes home from school with an obviously fractured finger, it doesn’t dawn on him to call the doctor, so then I become the bad guy when I chew him out over it and make the doctor’s appointment myself (from 180 miles away) and direct him to take her there.  Rude and snarky comments when I don’t get dinner going at his demand the first night of Passover, and then pretending (since he isn’t Jewish) to understand the significance of the holiday, and feigning complete ignorance as to the level of rudeness he just displayed.

I can’t wish my kids away.  What I do wish is that I would have left him 10 years ago when we were expecting our youngest kid.  But now what?  Do I leave him over his ongoing passive-aggression and thereby wreck our kids’ participation in extracurriculars (since he will, no doubt, constantly “forget” to get them where he needs to during his time of placement, should we split and have shared placement)?  At least the way things are, I can get them to Hebrew school, 4H, and other activities, no matter what night it is.  If we were to have 50-50 placement, then bye-bye participation in any non-school activities because he would be able to sabotage it half of the week.

I figure I am married to a PA  have put up with it for 31 years    never got any wedding gift from him or his family   he moved into my apartment and then the first week of marriage he wasnt there  he would go and stay with his cousin and have dinner with him   that first week I had such a strong feeling to leave him and get marriage annulled  but I loved him  so the torture continued on.    I bought a condo that we both moved into cuz I was desperate to get out of that 300 square foot apartment,    the condo was a disaster  it became dangerous and unliveable   24/7 of noise  vermin rats and mice and millions of cockroaches     I worked out of the condo so I ended up very sick being locked up in there   had to file bankruptcy  then we became homeless  too sick to work.   He had a lot of fun  he coached girls at a catholic private girls school making a penauts really a stipend   and boy did he work overtime.    also he does a radio show    for free  every sunday–more fun!!   never had a honeymoon never put up a dime for the small wedding no gift or even flowers when I married him not even an I Love You.      My father put up money for a house in cash and my mother felt sorry for hin and put Half in his name.    we moved in a very nice home bought and paid for and he never thanked anybody he actually used to sneer at me  he nver cut the grass he never did anything with the house  I couldnt do much –I was so sick from anxiety disorder and a chemical imbalance from the mess in that condo   He refused to take out trash.     H for example he left some rugs outside on the porch forever and yellow jackets made a nest  and he just let it go  my poor dog got stung but he was okay thank god  I begged him to get rid of the rugs  fell on deaf ears     never went on a trip  only to his home country where I was stuck for a month in the house with hsi mother doing nothing while he was out ;lying soccer with friends   He always told me his parents had a perfect marriage  but I found out the father was always cheating and never home
mother had everything provied for and seemed useless.    I always gave him my paycheck to pay bills.   I cooked and cleaned never complimented never appreciated.
I am an artist and he resented tht.   he decided that he wanted to be a painter  what a joke and got mad when I told him he has no  talent for that.   I have no relatives now but inherited some money that he wanted half of   Im too wise now and said never!!
Now I have Lyme disease was bedridden and of course he has no empathy and he screamed at me while I was at my lowest point   I am stronger now  —He refused to clean leaves or cut grass  so we were full of ticks never cleaned out little shed hundreds of mice   we had two dogs at time and he never cleaned up the poop   I did of course but it was a mess   people would walk by and look with disgust.    He lies alot but he turns it around on me like I imagined it all.    He has no friends  I feel drained of everything  and I am still paying out money he still makes peanuts   I beg him to make xtra try a tag sle to take the burden off me  but he never does.   I am afraid of going through all of  whatever I have left to take care of myself  he seems angry if he pays for a cheapo meal   my mother left me her almost new car he was driving and totaled it  and tried to keep the insurance money from it but I demanded it back
it goes on and on.  Im just like  all of you poor souls married to one of these  creeps.
good luck to all of you  but get out while you can

Crikey, this has knocked me for six. This is my husband after been married for 6 months how stupid I feel for falling for all is charm and believing her was such a good person. I now beginning to realize I need to get out of this marriage . We dated for 2 years before marrying and I was blinded by love even though all the signs were there. Now am paying for it. Am 54 , so tired with all that goes with PA man. I do not want to stay around to help him. Am done . Thank you for the insight x

This has been helpful for me.  My wife’s mother did a number on her.  She can’t get organized, she won’t stick to a plan (even seems like she makes a pint to never do so.” I do 80% of all house work, and she believes herself to be “doing all the house work alone.”
     The only undone work is her clothes, her room (I refuse to share one because I like to see my bed, floor and countertops not piles of clothes). She will spend all her time cleaning and things just look hordes, not sorted.  She places baskets and piles of loundry in the front and back hallway so that the doors can not be opened.  If I complain about they laundry (which primarily belongs to her but she mixes it with the children’s to,claim only partial ownership.  She will organize dirty dishes, but not clean them, sometimes several times before I or in a rare occasion she cleans them. Every bit of information brought her way is questioned to no end, depreciating the validity of the presenter.  She leaves for work 5 minutes before she should be there and has never been on time, ever, for a job while we have been together, 13 years.  She won’t plan events, parties or buy presents.  If she is criticized she will tantrum like a toddler.  I last week I spent hours fixing the furnace, when I came up she suggested I do the dishes while on a role.  We have split up, and she has threatened to move out, but instead she has moved into the living room, which is a mess now. She broke up with me because she could no longer stand my criticism, and she had an online boyfriend before she broke the news to me, but if she even thinks I am talking to someone she acts like we have never broken up and I betrayed her.
     I hate her mother, she is the most passive aggressive person I know personally.  She will walk into a room and huf and sie until someone asks what her problem is, then she tells you what yours is in that not so direct way. “O your Irish, lucky I am not Irish or I would have a broken fence and dirt for a from lawn.” Her mother makes her feel like a child who will never measure up to anything, her two older sisters, her ancestors ect.
I feel like the woman in the relationship with being the foundation for the kids and doing most of the housework, she was a stay at home mom for a long time, but I still did most of that stuff most of the time, the rest of the time it just went undone.  I feel like any bit of cleaning I do is enabling her to,believe she is maintaining the house.  My room is spotless, and the kids get clean sometimes, but she keeps the kitchen living room and her room in shambles.
Good to vent, I am not perfect, but I have nowhere here exadurated accept when I use words like never, she has bought some presents and must have gotten to work on time at some point, but examples are very hard to produce.
I am a Virgo and she an Aquarius if anyone was wondering.

I’ve been with my husband 10 years now .
I’m at the end of my tether now his PA is getting worse . He has been going to
He has been getting counselling first once a week he thinks when we have a good week he doesn’t need to go .
He is s workaholic and uses his work to stay later and later sometimes it’s to punish me .
Money and his work are his life I’m last .
He doesn’t talk to me unless it’s about work or someone at work , he never asks how me how my day has been . He is always calling me lazy though I work and do everything in the house cleaning shopping cooking car cleaning and everything that involves the car . We have houses we rent out I deal with all the cleaning maintenance contractors , taking phone calls for repairs finding someone to do them . I do the 6 monthly checks on the houses he says he doesn’t like going round peoples houses and has no time to do any repairs .
I do everything yet I’m still told I’m lazy . He also calls my son lazy and has insulted us both verbally with words you wouldn’t repeat .
He makes promises then drags his feet and if I remind him or ask if he has done that yet he will say no because you are going on about it .
When he realises he can’t find anymore excuses after a bad time arguing then he may be sorry but that’s after the ignoring and blaming me and the insults .
I’m lonely there is no affection no sec life not much communication. We don’t have friends as he won’t communicate with them and I find it embarrassing so dong invite anyone round now.
Family come but he works and rather than communicate he will go go bed early or sit on his iPad or just sit saying nothing .
He comes home unfriendly no sign that he actually likes me at all rather like he hates me .
When things have been horrendous I’ve said I wang to leave he then becomes nice for a while but it soon goes back to the later .
He controls me with finances, he sold the econical car for an expenses one which I find drains me of money to run it . If we talk about buying anything for the house that I want to change he will drag it out drag it out , I’ve waited 8 years for a new table , promises a new fridge but I’ve given up on that . Holidays we have some good ones but from the discussion about one go actually booking it is a long process and usually an awful time has to occur before it actually happens .
He is always saying he can’t agford it yet though we don’t spend on much rarely go out rarely look forward to anything as we aren’t able to plan because he won’t .
I’m just left broke as all my money goes on food things gifts for family and my son .
He makes me feel like a drain on him I don’t ask him anymore for anything .
He promised myself and my son a holiday and then didn’t book it and again caused a nightmare of a time as I kept asking if he had changed his mind as he hadn’t booked it he said again it’s becsusd I went on about it .
When I told him to stick it then he booked it and another time of ignoring me as I didn’t thank him that resulted in calling me boring and he was bored with me and didn’t know if he wanted to be with me any more . Because I went quiet what could I say . He then said something wrong with me behaving like that like he was oblivious to what he had done before.
Then said he wished he could cancel the holiday or my son should go with his girlfriend as I didn’t say thank you and I was rude and didn’t deserve to go .
I feel like I’m going mad . I want to leave had enough now.  No love affection money socialising always madd to feel blame yet he says I always blame him every thing is his fault and then the ignoring starts .
Figs children from his first marriage his mum his step mother me that dies the communication with them making excuses for him why he doesn’t call them though he may be at home at the time but won’t speak to them .
I’m venting as I’m angry frustrated and totally at a loss at the circle of episodes ever ceasing.
I’ve got to leave for my own happiness and that of my sons I know that .
I’ve stayed as he has no friends no family communication only his work which he says he only has and stats so long as my behaviour makes him stat there .
What will become of him also my financial situation will make it hard for me to move out and I know when I do he will make my life hell on earth not that it hasn’t been anyway .
I know I must go . I think I’ve gained the strength now probably because it’s hell to stay and the peace I will feel is what is helping me .
I’ve read a lot of these posts and to hear that some of you have had as bad a time as I have it helps as I feel like I’m not mad after all

If you’re married to this guy then file for a divorce. He’s having a picnic party grinding you to a knub.  Let the judge separate out the assets.  That will REALLY saddle his ass with reality.  Fuck him and all his manipulative passive aggressive bullshit shennannigins.  Start the formal process in motion and watch him turn into a puddle of shit that he is.  Any time a partner is refusing to do something because their partner “is going on about it”, that’s absolutely not love, that’s rote shittiness and just deliberate maliciousness.  This is an asshole.  A very quick way for him to get smart is to be served the divorce proceedings.  You stay in the house with your kids.  He hits or threatens you then?  Call 911 and report him. And just like that Mr. Bullshit Fuckhead is slam danced right into the fast lane of “Oops”.  He’ll get some respect that he’s apparently missing and right quick.  Stop being tortured by this asshat.

I want to say how moved and sad I am about so many people being in such pain. My own theory is that pa behavior is a form of spousal abuse. And while it seems more men go after women, this can happen in any relationship. I knew a 6’2” male friend whose wife would attack him when he got home, usually with an iron frying pan. He finally left her and is now remarried and happy. I am 63 and it took me decades to realize that my husband is pa. So is his family. Since I came from a very dysfunctional family my self esteem has always been very low so I kept trying to fix things, like it was all my fault. And I kept trying to get a real reaction from him which eventually led to me yelling.
On our first anniversary he said he had to go to a job out west. On a Sunday. How stupid I was. Ever since it has been getting worse. He denigrates, “forgets,” lies, manipulates and loves to get me when I am down already. Esp in front of people in a way that makes it difficult for me to respond without seeming like a jerk. He has revealed personal and sensitive info to people who I told him not to, and I  am only lucky in that he is able to hold a job, but he is never happy for more than a few months then starts to whine and uses it as an excuse not to do other stuff. He also has withheld info about unpaid taxes, the whereabouts of my kids, etc.
I just want to tell younger people, mostly women. Get a skill and get a job and get out! I was a teacher but could not get a job after a law was passed that cut the budget for teachers in our state. I thought it was important to stay near his family. What a mistake. I should have moved.
I did not recognize what was going on. I was molested by my father, my mother was sociopathic in nature and I was her favorite victim, and my sister became a pedophile. (For anyone who is surprised that women can be pedophiles and child molesters, just be aware that they are harder to catch but definitely exist.) A “family friend” of my husband’s family molested my oldest daughter and was going after the younger one when the older one told. To me. No one supports us. And he still talks to his family like it is ok they don’t ostracize this person, while I do. And them. Yet they all act like I am crazy. My daughter wants to prosecute but it would be her word against the adult molester. However several police officers and court officials interviewed her, along with mental health officials, and all agree that my daughter is being truthful.  Drives me nuts I cannot do anything more.
None of this would have happened if I had not been fed to the wolves (his family) by my spouse. In my neediness the molester groomed me by acting like a supportive friend. And yes, she is female. So I let her babysit. She betrayed my daughters and me.
Yet my spouse does not even act angry.
A pa spouse just doesn’t care. They may say they do. But they don’t. Look at the person’s behavior. Step back. Ask yourself if you would do these things.  If you can think of someone who truly loves or loved you. Does this feel the same?  Do you feel joy around your spouse or like you are waiting for the next bomb to drop? Look at what they do not what they say! (Although sometimes they even say very cruel things that seem to come from nowhere.)
I was lucky because the older woman I called Grandma who was just a neighbor treated me like a beloved granddaughter. I know what Love is to quote a certain movie!  So do you. It is what you feel for your kids or even your pets (who are way nicer to me than my spouse). Pa behavior isolates the non-pa spouse and that can lead to bad stuff happening. To you or your kids or even friends. I used to have several close friends and always a group to hang with. Now I have one and he said something disparaging about me talking to her the other day. Like I am not being loyal. Lol!
I have been getting better at disengaging from his shenanigans. That helps me not yell.  I am in ill health so cannot leave. (I have a theory that some spouses wait until you are ill or unable to leave financially to let their true nature really show.) I have stopped making excuses for him to my daughters. So they are seeing who the instigator really is when we fight.
It isn’t the best of circumstances but both girls will be away at college soon and he will be at work. So I won’t have to worry so much about protecting them from his often nasty comments or crappy behavior. And I am looking for an online job so I can have my own money.
Don’t wait. The few pa types who change make you work for it. And most do not change.
In the meantime do not confide in a pa. Many may not actually hit you physically but they are similar to abusers in many ways. If they sense they are unable to control you, you may be treated to one of their temper outbursts. If that ever happens remember it. That’s the way they really feel.

My husband has withheld sex.  He promises to do things I’ve asked for, that make me happy.  He drags his feet or does none of those things.  I told him I didn’t want to go on vacation because we had no dog sitter.  He booked the vacation and blamed me, saying that I would have been upset if he made no plans.  My dogs are so important to me.  He was ridiculous to say that.  He does stuff like this a lot.  My brother said he gaslighted me when I thought he was cheating.  He never answered a question simply.  He would answer with another question.  I have depression.  He always calls me crazy when we have a fight.  I have told him calmly and not so calmly what I would like in the marriage.  He rarely complies but makes promises that seem genuine.  I was ab idiot to believe his bullshit that everything was just fine before marriage.

My husband can transform from a wonderful human to the most horrid person ever in seconds and for reasons that can easily be taken care of, he just over reacts and seems like he just cannot stop himself. He yells, calls me names, he has hurt me not directly but as a result of him going everywhere and I didn’t move fast enough, he had avoid intimacy as long as it takes for me to learn my lesson and agree I was wrong or that I hurt him. He is not a monster, but he does have serious issues with his anger and I am just there, patiently working on myself and waiting for him to change, it will never happen I fear, but still even if i know is a good idea to leave with our son, I still cannot do it. I feel bad for him.
I keep reading articles, finding professional help, I keep working on myself, still I just cannot leave, isn’t that stupid?

Not stupid.  It’s called trauma bonding and actually loving someone.  You need to love yourself at least as much as your partner.  The amazing loving man is the mask.  The fake persona he presents to the world.  When he flips his shit, that’s the real party right there.  Asshole comes out to play.
If you don’t believe, arrange for someone to come over and show up during one of his dickhead sessions.  Watch him transform right back from dickhead to public image personna just snap snap quick as that.  Directly like someone having an all out angry tantrum, then they answer the phone and immediately go to everything is perfect sweetie fucking poo.  Shocking.  Manipulative.  Mind fuckers.  Actors.

Thought my partner was PA, but really she’s just suffering a low level chronic depression. Nothing clinical. Anyhow, I made an extra effort and that, plus other things turning for the better and she’s not PA any more.
Well, not more than anyone else is capable of being at times.

My suggestion is to consider that your partner might not be able to express that they are down and have felt down for a while. We can get swept up in life and not notice it… The old frog in the saucepan thing.

The whole thing even made me realise how I can be like that too when I’ve been having a tough time in life and feel hemmed in.

Hope this helps.

RE Diana!  Reply doesn’t seem to work!  Diana, don’t feel sorry for him!  Feel your pain, not his!  You’re just like me, overly empathetic to the point of losing or forgetting myself.  I’m an RN, I no longer work due to chronic illness, but my greatest strength of empathy is being exploited by my PA husband.  They prey on people like us.  I can’t seem to leave him either, but after an increase in his ridiculous angry tirades recently, I’m at the point of no return.  I can’t tolerate the anger, the name calling, the accusations, the disrespect, his unreasonable-ness ANYMORE.  He doesn’t know how to communicate or compromise while I trade my life away for him.  Stupid is right.  I have no friends where we live (thanks to him) & my family is over 2hrs away.  It sucks to feel so alone & “crazy” like you’re the only one who sees this dysfunction or cares about your marriage.  I can’t believe how stupid I am!  I put up with this for 15 year’s!  My husband is intolerable, I told him he acts like he wants me to kill myself because I had the misfortune of getting sick!  They will never change, I know that temporarily he’ll appear better, but it’ll all go to hell within a month.  For example my husband will get mad about something our cats did, he immediately freaks out & literally blames me, as if I can control a cat & compel them to eat the toilet paper or something!  I try to talk him down, but it always just gets worse!  He wastes at least 2-3hours yelling at me, repeating himself & saying things he should never say to his wife!  Ugh.  I’m exhausted, confused, & angry & I’m not letting it go this time!  My husband is terribly controlling & never deals with anything directly or at all really.  He just acts angry or distant or like a jerk & expects you to just know why!  Talking is great if you want to hear yourself blather on cause he’s not even listening & wouldn’t give you the satisfaction anyway!  At least we’re not the only fools on this site!  Take care Diana!

PS Diana, I love your name, I named my favorite cat Diana – after the greek goddess.  I have a goddess Diana print, still waiting for my husband to hang it, & that could take years!

Fellow chronic illness warrior/spoonie and I’ve been with my PA narcissist boyfriend about 10 years now. I’m hoping this year will be the year I finally leave. Just wanted you to know that I hear you & you’re not alone.

One factor that destroys a beautiful relationship is fault finding. Both partners can love each other, but when regular fault finding is introduced, it can destroy everything they have created in the relationship.

The root problem is, many people don’t know how to pass comments constructively and lovingly. Also, when their partners make some mistakes, they don’t separate these errors from their partners. This article teaches how to stop finding fault in relationships to prevent the union from failing.

When fault-finding becomes too much in a romantic relationship, it makes the union boring. The partner who supposedly commits those mistakes would not be free to be themselves. 

They would be too conscious about their actions and behaviors, which will make them more prone to repeating some of these mistakes. Also, excessive fault-finding makes the relationship toxic and unbearable for both parties, making them go their separate ways.

Not everyone in a relationship is perfect. When we make mistakes, we need our partners to correct us in a non-offensive way. However, some spouses have made it a habit to complain consistently without cutting their partners some slack.

If you feel you are in this category, here’s how to overcome fault-finding:

Your thoughts fuel your feelings and mannerisms, and this can sometimes lead you to find faults unnecessarily in your partner. Always keep an open mind when your partner makes a mistake, and don’t be quick to find faults in everything they do.

Sometimes, your intentions might be pure, but your words might not convey it the right way. Before you say anything, vet the words you want to use to ensure it doesn’t hurt your partner. Similarly, put yourself in their shoes to see how you would feel if such words were used on you.

Another way to stop finding fault in a relationship is to check if your complaints are worth it. If your partner did something wrong, investigate if it was entirely their fault or not. Also, remember that some faults are trivial, and they should go unnoticed to keep the relationship going smoothly.

Minh Levins’ book titled: Gratitude and Appreciation for your partner, helps people commend their partners more instead of complaining about their habits and attitudes.



Do you have a partner who complains at the slightest issue? It might be difficult managing such partners because they spot a fault in almost everything you do. Here are 15 ways to help you deal with chronic fault-finders:

Sometimes, it might look like your partner complains every time, but there might be something you failed to address. You need to find out the real reason why your partner complains and find a solution. 

Even if they are finding a fault in something trivial, you should address their concerns to ensure they don’t complain anymore.

When your partner finds fault regularly, it might be difficult trying not to take it personally. Since they are your romantic partner, you need to be careful how you handle their criticisms, especially if it happens regularly. 

You have to remember that your partner is complaining about something they are thinking of regarding you and not what you have necessarily done.

When dealing with someone who has a fault-finding personality, you should avoid arguing with them. You might want to get defensive when they pick up a fault, but it is essential to remain mute. 

It would be hard to communicate smoothly with them when you argue, and the problem won’t be solved.

For your partner to learn how to stop finding fault in relationship, you need to learn how to listen. Don’t dismiss their comments anytime they complain. 

Even though it doesn’t look like they are complaining about anything worthwhile, try to listen and understand why they are picking faults. Listening actively to your partner shows that you care about their concerns, and it is one step forward in helping them stop complaining.

If you want your spouse to know how to stop finding fault in relationship, be inclined to provide solutions. For instance, if they complain about something specific, look for a solution so they won’t find fault again. 

If you don’t solve their complaints, they will keep finding faults until they are solved, creating bigger conflicts in the home.

Sometimes, the solution to help your partner from complaining too much is to change the subject. You need to be smart and cautious, so they won’t suspect that you are trying to shut them up. 

Also, you can bring up discussions that will make them excited and change their mood from what they were finding fault about.

One way to help someone stop finding fault in a relationship is to make them focus on the positive side. For instance, if they find fault in something you have not been doing, remind them that you are working on it, and soon they will be impressed.

If you feel that your partner finds fault in everything and begins to affect your mental health, it is essential to set boundaries while finding a solution. 

Once you notice that it is becoming a pattern, try to create a different routine that will prevent you from being host to their constant fault-finding. You can bring up a conversation with them about the problem when you feel better to talk.

To know how to set boundaries, check out Laurie Bryan’s book titled: How to set healthy boundaries in relationships. The book contains actionable steps to help partners create healthy boundaries in their union. 



There has to be a point where your partner begins to find fault in almost everything, and this would help your partner know how to stop finding fault in relationship. 

Even though each event looks unrelated, something significant might have happened in the past that made your partner that way. Similarly, it might have been an insignificant action on your part that got them pissed.

When you cannot handle it anymore, it is time to express yourself to your partner. They need to know how you feel and how their several complaints have severely affected you. 

This might help them rethink and work on how to stop finding fault in a relationship if they see that you are getting tired of their complaints.

It is important to prevent your partner’s regular complaints from affecting your mood for the day. 

Sometimes, it is fine to allow your partner to do what they want while making yourself happy. To help your partner know how to stop finding fault in relationship, let them know that your happiness and peace of mind are also your priority.

When fault finding happens in relationships, the person who blames the other usually has a bad mood. You need to distance yourself from being the cause of their change in the mood while you find a solution to the problem. 

A relationship where one partner regularly blames their partner’s mood can make things toxic between them.

If your partner sees that you try to retaliate when they complain too much, they won’t know how to stop finding fault in relationship. Even if you feel like paying them in their coin, it is best to avoid retaliating because it would complicate the situation.

Related Relationship: 15 Reasons Why Relationships Are Complicated

If your partner is going through a tough time, it can affect their mood and make them find fault regularly in your relationship. It’s advisable to find out what is going on with them and see how you can help. 

Your partner might not know that they are complaining excessively until you make them see it.

When finding fault in relationships occurs regularly, it could mean that your partner’s love tank is low. This implies that your relationship lacks some romantic activity that is making them complain more.

You can salvage the situation by planning something unexpected for them. Integrating romance, surprises, and the likes into your relationship reminds your partner that you still love them irrespective of the conflict rocking the relationship.

Attachment theory is a biopsychosocial model referring to a person’s characteristic ways of relating in close relationships, such as with parents, children, and romantic partners. These ways of relating are learned during early infancy and mold subsequent intimate relationships. An adult who is securely attached has internalized a reliable relationship to his/her caregivers in infancy, and thus is capable of adapting to different social contexts and, more importantly, of maintaining an adequate equilibrium between self-regulation and interpersonal regulation of stress. Insecure adult attachment styles are divided into 1) anxious/preoccupied (individuals are hypersensitive to rejection and show compulsive care- and attention-seeking behavior); 2) avoidant/dismissing (individuals are hyposensitive to social interactions, and are socially isolated); and 3) unresolved/disorganized (individuals are unable to cope under stress, thus suffering pervasive affective dysregulation). This review discusses the theoretical, psychological, neuroscientific, and developmental aspects of attachment from an evidence-based perspective. It provides an updated account of the science regarding attachment and its relevance to the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illness. It examines the privileged relation between attachment and personality disorders (PDs) from multiple angles in order to introduce the most recent psychotherapeutic advances, based on attachment research, for the treatment of PDs, particularly borderline PD. Three effective, evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions are described: Mentalization-Based Treatment, Transference-Focused Psychotherapy and Schema-Focused Therapy.

Attachment theory, conceived by John Bowlby (1), refers to a person’s characteristic ways of relating in intimate relationships to “attachment figures,” often one’s parents, children, and romantic partners (2, 3). From birth, the interactions of an infant with his/her primary caregivers will establish a base for personality development and will mold subsequent close relationships, expectations of social acceptance, and attitudes to rejection. A secure base is formed when the attachment figure (usually the mother) provides stability and safety in moments of stress, which allows the infant to explore his/her surroundings. Thus, the child creates a set of mental models of him/herself and others in social interactions (“internal working models”), based on repeated interactions with significant others (4). These early attachment relations are crucial for the acquisition of capacities for affect and stress regulation, attentional control, mentalization, and for the infant’s sense of self-agency (5).

The attachment literature has been dominated by operationalized assessments of characteristic patterns of relating. Most influential were observations of individual differences in infants’ attachment security assessed by the Strange Situation procedure (6). When briefly separated from their caregivers and left with a stranger in an unfamiliar setting, infants show certain behavioral patterns. Three distinct attachment patterns have been identified from the application of this procedure: secure (63% of children tested), anxious/resistant or ambivalent (16%), and avoidant (21%). In adults, attachment style is respectively classified as secure/autonomous (58% of the nonclinical population), avoidant/dismissing (23%), and anxious/preoccupied (19%) (7, 8); these classifications stem from the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) (9, 10), which elicits attachment narratives from the subject’s childhood. Further work has revealed a fourth pattern of disorganized attachment, which is often termed unresolved/disorganized for adults and disoriented/disorganized for infants (2). Adults showing this pattern are also classified within one of the three primary categories (5).

During the Strange Situation, a securely attached infant readily explores his/her new surroundings in the primary caregiver’s presence, shows anxiety in the stranger’s presence, is distressed by the caregiver’s brief absence, rapidly seeks contact with the caregiver upon reunion, and is reassured by renewed contact, rapidly resuming exploration. Likewise, an adult categorized as secure/autonomous during the AAI coherently integrates attachment memories into a meaningful narrative and shows appreciation for attachment relationships.

An avoidant infant is less anxious at separation, may not seek contact with the caregiver on his/her return, and may not prefer the caregiver to the stranger. In adults, avoidant/dismissing AAI narratives will lack coherence; patients will be unable to recall specific memories in support of general arguments and will idealize or devalue their early relationships (5). These behaviors appear as the result of a “hyper-deactivation” of the attachment system. This hyper-deactivation is characterized by the inhibition of proximity-seeking behaviors and the determination to handle stress alone. This implies a clear attempt to inhibit negative emotions through a noninterpersonal way of regulating them (11).

An anxious/resistant infant shows limited exploration and play, seems highly distressed by the separation, and does not easily settle after reunion. Correspondingly, an anxious/preoccupied adult’s AAI narratives will lack coherence and will show confusion, anger, or fear in relation to early attachment figures (5). This corresponds to the hyperactivation of proximity-seeking and protection-seeking strategies, to a (chronic) hypersensitivity to signs of possible rejection or abandonment, and to an intensification of undesirable emotions (11).

A disoriented/disorganized infant will show undirected or bizarre behavior such as freezing, hand clapping, or head banging. The infant may try to escape the situation. Comparably, an unresolved/disorganized adult’s narratives about bereavements or childhood traumas will contain semantic and/or syntactic confusions. This corresponds to the breakdown of strategies to cope with stress, leading to partial or even pervasive emotion dysregulation.

These styles remain relatively stable during life and do not show gender differences or variations with language or culture (8). There is a 68%−75% correspondence between attachment classification in infancy and in adulthood (5). The most important predictor of style change during life is negative early life events, such as loss of a parent, parental divorce, life-threatening illness of parent or child, parental psychiatric disorder, physical maltreatment, or sexual abuse (12–14).

Although attachment processes are normative and necessary for human (and mammalian) survival, attachment theory is increasingly being used to investigate and intervene in personality disorders (PDs) (8, 15–17). PDs are enduring behaviors (18); their features include an intrapersonal component (dysregulation of arousal, impulse, and affect), an interpersonal component (dysfunctional relationship patterns), and a social component (which creates conflicts with others and with social institutions) (16). Attachment theory accounts for these four characteristics of PDs (19) and provides an ideal standpoint to understand these disorders, integrating psychological (20), psychiatric (21), genetic (22), developmental (23–25), neuroscientific (25–28), and clinical (2, 29–31) perspectives.

There is a large body of literature addressing the relation between PDs and attachment theory and research. This review approaches this relation from an evidence-based perspective, highlighting implications for the treatment of PDs.

Many of the features of insecure attachment in adulthood resemble the signs and symptoms of PD (16). There have been numerous studies of attachment patterns in people with PDs, particularly of the DSM-IV cluster B (32), which indicate that such individuals show higher rates of insecure attachment than the general population (33). Conversely, secure attachment is rarely associated with borderline PD (BPD) and avoidant PD (19, 34).

Adults presenting a preoccupied style are more sensitive to rejection and anxiety, and are prone to histrionic, avoidant, borderline, and dependent PDs. Conversely, the hypoactivation of attachment shown by dismissing individuals is associated with schizoid, narcissistic, antisocial, and paranoid PDs (8, 19, 35–38).

BPD is strongly associated with preoccupied attachment in the presence of unresolved trauma (6, 8, 15, 19, 36, 39) and with unresolved attachment patterns (19). Studies have found that 50%−80% of BPD patients fit either or both of these attachment styles (11, 40). This makes sense in light of both the approach-avoidance social dynamics and sensitivity to rejection (preoccupied dimension) and the cognitive-linguistic slippage (incoherent/disorganized dimension) evident in BPD patients (19). Misunderstanding of social causality and thought disturbances are distinctive features of BPD (41–43). In behavioral terms, BPD patients exhibit angry withdrawal and compulsive care-seeking. This implies a lack of the capacity to use and obtain relief from new attachment figures, which has important implications within a close helping relationship such as the therapeutic exchange: BPD patients will be more attentive to the failures than the efforts of the therapist (15, 40, 44, 45). The same associations between attachment styles and pathological personality features are found in adolescents (19, 23, 46).

Most research assessing the relation between attachment and PDs does not control for comorbidity on either Axis I or II, which could result in diffuse patterns of association (11, 19). In the case of BPD, different Axis I comorbidities are associated with different attachment styles: BPD with comorbid anxiety or mood disorders tends to be associated with preoccupied attachment, while BPD with comorbid substance or alcohol abuse tends toward a dismissing style. In spite of these differences, the unresolved/disorganized attachment style seems to be common in BPD overall, which explains the pathognomonic emotional dysregulation of BPD patients (11). These research limitations accentuate the value of the new efforts toward dimensional rather than categorical diagnostic systems (21, 47), and for person-centered rather than symptom-centered ways of addressing mental disorders (11, 19, 21, 38, 48–50). Such ways of understanding and conceptualizing psychopathology (and particularly PDs) (38) are necessarily longitudinal, because only a developmental perspective can offer an insight into the processes underlying symptomatic manifestations and allow clinicians to assess a particular patient’s risks and strengths, account for high rates of comorbidity, tailor interventions, and maintain a fruitful therapeutic relationship (11, 26, 44, 51, 52).

It is likely that various developmental pathways lead to a given attachment style and its concomitant psychopathological risks, involving complex interactions between biological and psychosocial factors.

The stable nature of attachment styles accounts for the development of enduring strategies to regulate emotion and social contact. Securely attached individuals trust their attachment figures and perceive little environmental threat. As a result, they can defend themselves against environmental challenges and are able to process emotions in a fluid and nondefensive way; hence, they are the group least troubled by PDs. These individuals continue seeking effective attachment relations through their whole lifespan (53). Dismissing individuals, chronically lacking support from attachment figures, habitually deny or dismiss environmental threats (54). They may therefore have a higher threshold for experiencing negative emotions or perceiving attachment needs, exhibiting what Bowlby called “compulsive self-reliance” (55). Preoccupied individuals, who are wary following a history of inconsistent support from caregivers, are likely to have a lower threshold for perceiving environmental threat and, therefore, stress. This is likely to contribute to frequent activation of the attachment system, with the concomitant distress and anger such activation can cause. Hence, they are likely to manifest compulsive care-seeking and over-dependency. Unresolved/disorganized individuals—the adult analog of disorganized/disoriented infants—frequently have parents who are themselves abusive or unresolved regarding their own losses or abuse experiences (56–59). These individuals appear to be the most troubled in terms of PDs (17).

Twin studies have shown that genetic factors account for 45% of individual differences in adult attachment anxiety and 36% in attachment avoidance (22). The influence of genetic factors in attachment security has been estimated at between 23% and 45% and underscores the bidirectional nature of the development of attachment relationships: infants and children cocreate patterns of relating with their caregivers. There is great overlap between genetic factors influencing both attachment style and personality traits (60–63). Nevertheless, to the extent that these are separable, environmental factors ubiquitously appear to be the most important influence in the development of attachment. Among external factors, the most important is the secure presence of an effective primary caretaker who is sensitive to the infant’s verbal and nonverbal cues and is able to respond to them without being overwhelmed by anxiety. A child who is securely attached has had his/her acute affective states consistently reflected back to him/her in an accurate, but not overwhelming, manner (26, 54, 64). This process equips the infant with an increasing capacity for mental processing, particularly mentalization, the capacity to understand the social world and one’s internal world in terms of mental states; that is, the capacity to imagine that others have a mind that is essentially like one’s own (39, 51, 57, 58, 65–67). This capacity means that individuals with a healthy personality interpret and respond to another’s feelings, not just to their own experience. In this sense, the emergence of spoken language about feelings seems to be related to the attachment figure’s ability to put the child’s mental experience into words: securely attached children seem to acquire speech more rapidly and remain more verbally competent than insecure children (29, 68). Conversely, insecure attachment leads to developmental impairment of the internal state lexicon and subsequent alexithymia in adulthood (69). Effective therapies must therefore include a component that allows patients to recognize, label, and verbally communicate their feelings (26, 70–72).

Good-quality interactions with early caregivers are the critical element in the development of secure attachment. In turn, secure emotional attachment is more crucial for the development of a healthy personality than intellectual stimulation of the infant (25). It is thus unsurprising that there is a high prevalence of childhood trauma in both insecurely attached individuals and PD patients (8, 45, 73–76). Childhood trauma is more strongly correlated with an incoherent/disorganized adult attachment style than with the general category of attachment insecurity (19, 36).

Rates of childhood trauma among individuals with PDs are high (73% report abuse, of which 34% is sexual, and 82% report neglect). Compared with nonclinical adults, PD patients are four times as likely to have suffered early trauma (14). Childhood physical abuse increases the risk for adult antisocial, borderline, dependent, depressive, passive-aggressive, and schizoid PDs (38). Infantile neglect is associated with risks for antisocial, avoidant, borderline, narcissistic, and passive-aggressive PDs (14, 54, 77). BPD is more consistently associated with childhood abuse and neglect than other PD diagnoses (14, 24, 51, 66, 73, 76, 77). Obsessive-compulsive PD has been associated with sexual abuse by noncaretakers (77).

However, not all people who have suffered childhood trauma develop adult psychopathology. The effects of trauma are influenced by attachment (75) and by biological dispositions, which are examined in the next section. For example, female victims of maltreatment and sexual abuse in adolescence or adulthood are at greater risk of developing posttraumatic symptoms if they have an anxious attachment style (78). Likewise, female victims of childhood trauma are more likely to develop somatization symptoms if they are fearfully attached (79). If traumatic events provoke activation of the attachment system, then individuals who tend to respond to these experiences through the inhibition of mentalizing function and emotional regulation are less likely to resolve these events and more likely to manifest personality pathology later in life (80).

New technologies in human and animal neurosciences have enabled the investigation of both attachment and PDs from an enriching and novel perspective. A seminal discovery has been the identification of neural correlates of the innate predisposition to, and later need for, attachment relations. There is a common neurobiology of mother-infant, infant-mother, and romantic-partner attachment, linked to opioid alkaloids that are capable of reproducing the same neurological and behavioral effects as substance addiction (81, 82). Following these discoveries, two major neural systems have been shown to play a critical role in attachment behaviors: the dopaminergic reward-processing system and the oxytocinergic system (26). The role of the dopaminergic reward system in attachment behavior is understood as an evolutionary mechanism to motivate reproductive mating, maternal care, and, ultimately, offspring survival. It leads individuals to seek close relations with other humans and produces satisfaction when they are attained. The areas of the brain recruited by this system include the striatum, a key projection of midbrain dopamine neurons that includes the putamen and caudate head (26).

Oxytocin is a neuroactive hormone produced in the hypothalamus and projected to brain areas that are associated with emotions and social behaviors. It plays an important role in the activation of the dopaminergic reward system (oxytocin receptors are located in the ventral striatum, a key dopaminergic area) and the deactivation of neurobehavioral systems related to social avoidance (26, 28). Oxytocin receptors are found in areas known to be recruited in attachment and other social behaviors, such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, central nucleus of the amygdala, ventral tegmental area, and lateral septum. These areas are also rich in vasopressin (V1a) receptors, but oxytocin has been studied more extensively because it can be synthesized in the laboratory and safely administered to human subjects; therefore, experimental oxytocin research has been popular over the past decade. The experimental administration of vasopressin agonists in studies of attachment has not yielded significant results (83).

Oxytocin is a facilitator of attachment (24, 84): it enhances sensitivity to social cues (85–87), accelerates social connectedness (88), improves social memory (89, 90), and facilitates the encoding and retrieval of happy social memories (91). By attenuating activity in the extended amygdala (92), oxytocin also acts to neutralize negative feelings toward others, and enhances trust (88, 93, 94). Oxytocin can inhibit hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity when the attachment system is activated (26): secure attachment leads to “adaptive hypoactivity” of the HPA axis, which, in turn, reduces social anxiety (53).

It must be noted that these positive effects of oxytocin are not universal. The administration of oxytocin to adults has been shown to facilitate prosocial behavior toward members of their in-group only, and to enhance trust toward reliable and neutral peers but not peers who have proven to be unreliable (95, 96). The effects of oxytocin administration are also personality-dependent: individuals with alexithymia seem to improve their social abilities to a greater extent than people who do not show this trait (97).

Correspondingly, insecure attachment is closely bound to the divergent effects of oxytocin. The neuropeptide is found in lower concentrations among maltreated children and adults with a history of early separation, and in insecurely attached mothers during the puerperal period, which further hampers the establishment of secure attachment in their children (26). In the case of insecurely attached BPD patients, oxytocin decreases trust and the likelihood of cooperative responses and reduces dysphoric responses to social stress (27, 98).

In conclusion, oxytocin does not uniformly facilitate trust and prosocial behavior; its behavioral effects are mediated by the social context, personality traits, and the quality of early attachment (27, 99). This highlights the need to address PDs and mental health in general as an indivisible combination of environmental, psychological, and physical factors (25, 76).

This integrated, biopsychosocial perspective for understanding PDs is still novel. Most research has focused on BPD and antisocial PD (45, 100). For example, early maltreatment is more likely to produce adult antisocial behavior only in males with a polymorphism in the gene involved in the production of the neurotransmitter-metabolizing enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). Males with high MAOA activity show less antisocial behavior even if they have experienced early maltreatment. This indicates that certain genotypes can moderate sensitivity to stressors (101). In monkeys, impulsive aggression is correlated with low cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), which is involved in serotonergic metabolism. However, this inherited characteristic is modulated by attachment experiences: monkeys reared by mothers show higher concentrations of 5-HIAA than those reared by peers (102, 103). People with an avoidant attachment style show decreased activity of the striatum and ventral tegmental area, suggesting lack of response to social rewards. Conversely, people with a preoccupied attachment style show increased activity in the left amygdala, suggesting increased sensitivity to social punishment (104). In these cases attachment moderates the relation between genotype, nervous activity, and pathologic behavior.

As described in the previous section, early trauma has implications for attachment and personality pathology. The hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to stress, given its many glucocorticoid receptors. BPD patients show reduced hippocampal and amygdalar volumes, especially if they have suffered early trauma (45, 105–107). Relational trauma promotes hemispheric lateralization, which adversely affects the early integration of brain hemispheres (108, 109). As a consequence, affective experiences, which are usually stored in the right front lobe, are split from the cognitive functions of the left hemisphere, explaining in part the emotional dysregulation found in BPD patients (26, 45, 100, 109, 110). Childhood trauma produces persistent sensitization of the HPA axis, which regulates stress responses. This effect is particularly noticeable in BPD females who have been abused (111, 112). The HPA axis is intimately linked with serotonergic function, which could explain the divergent effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in BPD patients (113, 114).

These complex interactions between “nature” and “nurture” put the concept of attachment in a privileged position from which to understand the etiology, development, and treatment of PDs (45, 110, 115, 116). Attachment is becoming a central concept in the development, planning, and assessment of psychotherapeutic interventions. At the same time, researchers are starting to assess the effects of psychotherapy on attachment and relating them to process and outcome (31, 117, 118).

Considering that empirical evidence demonstrates that insecure attachments are risk factors for PDs and other mental illnesses, researchers have taken an interest in the relationship between attachment and psychotherapeutic success.

It is widely accepted that attachment characteristics influence psychotherapeutic outcomes, but results are inconsistent (119, 120). Most studies show that securely attached patients obtain better results (2, 34, 120–123), but others indicate better outcomes for avoidant and disorganized patients (39).

The largest meta-analysis on the influence of attachment on psychotherapeutic outcome in various diagnoses (including PDs) and heterogeneous psychotherapeutic orientations consistently found that while attachment anxiety negatively affects outcome, attachment avoidance has no effect. This meta-analysis confirmed that higher attachment security predicts better therapeutic outcomes (2).

Besides symptomatic outcomes, attachment is associated with dropout. Adult avoidant attachment constitutes a risk for dropout because patients are not fully committed, attached, or engaged with the therapist or the treatment (38, 124). Psychotherapy can be seen as a threat to these patients’ defensive apathy and increases negative transference (124, 125). Contrastingly, preoccupied patients are at risk of dropout after perceived abandonments such as emergency cancellations or scheduled vacations. Fearfully preoccupied individuals are prone to dropout in response to feeling attached to or dependent on the therapist and treatment (126).

Attachment also influences the therapeutic alliance, which in turn has important effects on outcome (127). While secure patients perceive their therapists as responsive and emotionally available, avoidant/fearful patients are reluctant to make personal disclosures, feel threatened, and suspect that the therapist is disapproving. Preoccupied patients long for more contact with the therapist and wish to expand the relationship beyond the bounds of therapy (44, 128).

Following Bowlby’s attachment theory, not only protection-seeking but also caregiving behavior is influenced by attachment (129). Therefore, the therapist’s attachment style also influences the process and outcome of treatment. Therapists with anxious attachment styles create strong therapeutic alliances, but the quality of the alliance decreases with time when patients show interpersonal distress (130, 131). Sessions between an avoidant therapist and an anxious patient attain less depth (121).

Some studies have shown changes in patients’ attachment resulting from treatment. One of the authors (P.F.) reported on a sample of BPD patients under psychodynamic treatment. After treatment, 40% of the sample was classified as secure; none of the patients had that classification at pretreatment (132). Patients with various diagnoses showed an increase in attachment security after 21 sessions of psychodynamic psychotherapy (133). A multisite study of several inpatient group psychotherapies found consistent improvement (compared with controls) of attachment security after 9 weeks’ treatment, which was maintained at 1-year follow-up (119). In a randomized controlled trial of Transference-Focused Psychotherapy (TFP), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and supportive therapy, only TFP showed an increased number of patients classified as secure after treatment (118). A successful treatment does not necessarily imply attainment of a secure attachment style: female BPD patients whose attachment style changes from ambivalent to avoidant have shown better symptomatic results at the end of short-term therapy (31).

Although there is a great deal of interest in clinical applications of attachment theory, most clinical research in PDs is conceptual and case-study-based (117). For BPD, however, there has been more extensive research, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of published studies. The American Psychiatric Association’s guidelines for the treatment of BPD recommend psychotherapy as primary treatment, complemented by symptom-targeted pharmacotherapy (134). SSRIs are recommended for tackling emotional dysregulation and impulsivity, and antipsychotics are recommended for cognitive-perceptual symptoms. SSRIs could reduce HPA axis hyperactivation, contributing to the patient’s capacity to reflect on mental states without overreacting to them and thus facilitating psychotherapeutic interventions (45).

Mentalization is the process by which we make sense of each other and ourselves, implicitly and explicitly, in terms of subjective states and mental processes (135). Mental disorders in general can be seen as the mind misinterpreting its own experience of itself and therefore of others (136). The concept of mentalization is rooted in attachment theory. It postulates that one’s understanding of others depends on whether one’s own mental states were adequately understood by caring, attentive, nonthreatening adults. Problems in affect regulation and attentional control stemming from dysfunctional attachment relationships (40, 74, 137) are mediated through a failure to develop a robust mentalizing capacity (26, 64, 66, 71, 136, 138–142).

Under stressful conditions, and in the face of activation of their flawed attachment system, BPD patients temporarily lose their mentalization capacity, consequently misunderstanding social causality and showing cognitive and emotional dysregulation (26, 135, 140). MBT aims to stabilize the patient’s sense of self and help him/her maintain an optimal level of arousal in the context of a well-managed (i.e., neither too intense nor too detached) attachment relationship between patient and therapist (140, 143). The therapist must be aware of the hypersensitivity of such patients to interpersonal anxiety, which could overwhelm the patient’s mentalization capacity, putting the therapeutic relationship at risk (5, 136, 140, 144–146).

Despite MBT’s psychoanalytic origins, interventions are taken from various psychotherapeutic approaches. This plurality, together with the minimal amount of training and supervision necessary (147–150), makes MBT appealing to professionals from various orientations. MBT interventions are designed to stress the attachment relationship within controlled conditions and to lend special attention to the therapeutic relationship. For a detailed description of the techniques and therapeutic stance, we recommend reading the treatment manuals (143, 151).

Mentalization theory is now being applied to the treatment of numerous disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, antisocial PD, and depression) in a number of contexts (inpatient, partial hospitalization [38, 147–149] and outpatient [152]), and in different groups of patients (adolescents, families [153], and substance abusers [136]) (65). MBT has been manualized for PDs (143, 151) and been shown to be efficacious in RCTs (147–149, 152).

MBT for inpatients with severe BPD has been shown to be superior to routine general psychiatric care in improving depressive symptoms, decreasing suicidal and self-harm acts, reducing inpatient days, and improving social and interpersonal function. Improvements started 6 months into treatment and continued to increase to the end of the 18-month treatment (147). Follow-up every 3 months after the end of treatment showed that patients kept improving to 18 months (148). A further follow-up of the same study, 8 years after initial randomization, showed that MBT patients maintained their gains and showed better social and vocational status and less symptomatology than control subjects (149). The higher costs of implementing MBT were offset by less inpatient care during treatment and decreased service utilization during follow-up (154). In an outpatient setting, an RCT of MBT versus structured clinical management showed faster change for MBT patients in suicide attempts, severe self-harm incidents, self-reported interpersonal functioning, and psychiatric symptoms (152).

An 18-month, group-based MBT treatment for antisocial PD is currently being tested (38). Preliminary results show reduced self-reported aggression and reduced psychiatric symptomatology after the first 6 months of treatment. However, the authors warn about the difficulty of engaging these patients. Another unpublished study of MBT for antisocial PD is currently being carried out at a high-security hospital in England (38).

TFP is a manualized psychodynamic treatment for patients with BPD (155). It is based on both object-relations and attachment theories: representations of self and others, together with their affective valence, are derived from the internalization of attachment relationships with caregivers. The degree of differentiation and integration of these representations is disturbed in individuals with BPD (150, 156).

The primary goal of TFP is to reduce symptomatology and self-destructive behavior by modifying representations of self and others as they are enacted in the therapeutic relationship, and, ultimately, change the patient’s underlying personality organization. TFP is a structured treatment consisting of twice-weekly 45-minute sessions over 3 years. Its primary focus is on the predominant affect-laden themes that emerge in the therapeutic (transference) relationship, while monitoring the patient’s life outside sessions. The therapist uses techniques of clarification, confrontation, and transference interpretation (i.e., interpretation of the current patient-therapist interactions, which unveil the patient’s disparate perceptions of self and others including the therapist). In contrast to MBT, TFP considers interpretation as the route to integration of these disparate perceptions and representations, and activation of the attachment system is not avoided (124, 157). In turn, the integration of these representations and their concomitant emotions enables the development of a more complex capacity to think about the thoughts, feelings, intentions, and desires of self and others (i.e., mentalization) (158). This leads to increased modulation of affect, coherence of identity, greater capacity for intimate relationships, reduction in self-destructive behaviors, and general improvement in functioning (118, 150, 156).

TFP is well tolerated, and has positive outcomes in parasuicidal behaviors, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, hospital days, and global functioning (159). TFP in outpatient settings has shown to be more effective than treatment as usual (118), and its results are comparable to those of DBT (160) in suicidality after 1 year of treatment, and superior in outcomes of violence and irritability (161). After 3 years of treatment, studies show reductions in BPD symptoms and pathologic personality traits, and improvement of general quality of life (162, 163). TFP has also demonstrated structural changes in attachment and mentalization (118, 158).

Stemming from a cognitive-behavioral orientation, SFT conceptualizes BPD patients psychologically and emotionally as young children (164). Their inner world is understood as being formed by four pathologic self-schemas that have become fixed as a result of the interplay between genetic endowment and inappropriate parenting (165). These schemas are evident in BPD patients at different moments (71). Patients can act as detached protectors (showing emotional withdrawal and behavioral avoidance), punitive parents (self-harm), abandoned/abused children (frightened isolation), or angry/impulsive children (expressing rage directed toward those who did not meet their childhood emotional needs) (164). These same schemas exist in antisocial patients, together with the powerful presence of a “healthy adult” schema, an executive function for higher cognitive skills (166). SFT techniques are cognitive, behavioral, and experiential. The most important is “limited reparenting” by the therapist: the practitioner attempts to meet the patient’s unfulfilled emotional needs by being warm and sympathetic, self-disclosing, giving extra sessions and telephone or e-mail exchanges, or praising the patient. The idea is to develop a therapeutic relationship that is both a contrast and an antidote to the abusive relationships the patient experienced as a child, while maintaining professional and therapeutic boundaries (164, 165). Once this bond is achieved, cognitive techniques attempt to change unhealthy schemas and the patient is encouraged to practice new behaviors outside the session. SFT is a twice-weekly therapy lasting at least 2 years.

Outcomes of SFT have been found to be superior to TFP in reduction of borderline symptoms and general psychopathology and in quality of life improvement. SFT also showed lower dropout rates and better quality of therapeutic alliance (162, 167). SFT was also shown to be slightly more cost-effective than TFP (168). These results are limited due to several methodological flaws of the trial (150). Another study found that adding 8 months of group SFT to treatment as usual (individual psychotherapy) showed no dropout and increased the success rate from 16% to 94%. Symptomatic gains were maintained at 6-month follow-up (169). An ongoing trial of SFT with forensic patients presenting antisocial, borderline, narcissistic, and paranoid PDs has preliminarily shown good symptomatic outcomes and low attrition rates (170). SFT has also shown good outcomes in interpersonal problems in people diagnosed with agoraphobia and cluster C PDs (171).

Across pathologies, different treatments work for different subgroups. It could be argued that while MBT is a more generic approach that is optimal for BPD patients with multiple personality problems that might undermine focusing on specific attachment relationships, TFP and SFT are more focused, efficacious attempts at exploring particular significant interpersonal relationship representations.

Attachment theory overarches the psychological, psychiatric, social, and neuroscientific work on PDs. Its usefulness has been shown in the scientific field, and it is being translated into clinical settings. Practitioners can profit from the use of simple measures of attachment in order to tailor their interventions to maximize gains and minimize iatrogenic effects, which are all too common in the treatment of PDs (2, 19, 23, 29, 117, 122). Many mental health interventions have the potential to activate the attachment system of vulnerable patients but lack a structure to contain the emotional and behavioral consequences of the stress aroused, ranging from dropout to suicide (150, 167). Therefore, it is necessary to modify treatment settings in order to offer a “secure base” from which to start a curative change in relationship representations (136, 158, 172).

We cannot paint everyone with borderline personality disorder with a single brushstroke. Even though people may carry the same diagnostic label, their unique life experiences and innate temperaments will create different coping styles and thus symptom profiles. 

In this article, we will review how different attachment styles may affect your push-pull behaviors and explain various BPD symptoms.

Our parents' responses to our attachment-seeking behaviors shape how we see the world later in life.

In the most ideal scenario, we would have had attachment interactions with someone loving, attuned, and nurturing, who can mirror our emotions back to us accurately and does not ask us to carry their distress. That will be how we develop a sense of safety and trust for those around us. We would internalize the message that the world is a friendly place; we trust that someone will be there for us when we are in need.

However, if the message that we were given by our caregivers was that the world was unsafe, it could affect our ability to withstand uncertainty in life. Since we may feel unable to sit with any ambiguity in communication, we may demand constant reassurance, quickly flip into black-or-white thinking, feel the impulse to end everything, or plunge into despair whenever conflict arises.

Attachment theory was originally developed by John Bowlby (1907-1990), who started by observing how infants react to being separated from their parents. Psychologists found that without conscious intervention, we tend to stick with our childhood attachment styles. To put it simply, if we have an anxious attachment pattern, we might become attached and clingy; if we have an avoidant attachment pattern, we tend to cut off to protect ourselves.

There are four main attachment styles. They can be understood via where they fall on two dimensions: anxiety and avoidance (Brennan, Clark, & Shaver,1998).

1. Secure attachment

Securely attached individuals who are low on both anxiety and avoidance. They tend to view themselves positively and believe that they are worthy of care. They usually grew up in a supportive environment where parents were responsive to their needs. Securely attached people are usually flexible, open, and warm. They can be vulnerable and express emotions in front of others.

2. Anxious-preoccupied (anxious) attachment

People who are high on the anxiety dimension are more likely to have a negative view of themselves. If you are anxiously attached, it means that your upbringing has caused you to believe you were unworthy of love and care. You crave intimacy and approval, yet fear rejection and abandonment.

You have developed this form of attachment likely because your parents were or continue to be inconsistent with their emotional availability and responses. Maybe at times, they were nurturing. Other times, or as their mood changed, they flipped to being cold, rejecting, detached, or even cruel. You never knew what to expect. This results in a hyper-vigilant psyche—at every moment, you feel like you have to watch out for any signs of change in the relationship dynamics.

As an anxious child, you sought constant assurance, approval, and attention from others, and as an adult, you may demand these from your partners. You have an intense need for contact and connection, which can come across as being dependent or clingy. You struggle with the idea of object constancy and experience constant fear of abandonment. You are highly aware of the smallest hint that others may be angry, upset, or pulling back from you. When you feel insecure, you cannot help but react with fear, anger, and a desperate search for contact, validation, and connection. 

You tend to struggle more with maladaptive dependency. You may sacrifice your own needs for that of others, and find it difficult to trust your ability to endure or enjoy solitude. 

Anxiously attached individuals with borderline personality disorder may relate more to the descriptions of "classic" BPD, where the fear of abandonment and instability in interpersonal relationships are core features.

3. Dismissive-avoidant (avoidant) attachment

Individuals high on the avoidance dimension have developed negative views of others. If you are avoidantly attached, you learned through experience that people could not be counted on, and you have to rely only on yourself.

You tend to minimize or downplay painful feelings. You may not remember much of your childhood and feel uncomfortable speaking about it. Normalizing, intellectualizing, and rationalizing painful events are your core coping mechanisms.

Children develop this attachment style when their primary caregivers are not responsive to or reject their needs. You eventually become uncomfortable with emotional openness and you deny the need for intimacy even to yourself. You place a high value on independence and autonomy and would do all you can to avoid feeling overwhelmed, engulfed, and controlled. You may recognize the value of relationships and even have a strong desire for them, but have difficulty trusting others. 

If you have this attachment style and BPD, you may relate more to descriptions of quiet BPD or high-functioning BPD. In quiet BPD, you turn your pain inward and hurt yourself rather than lash out at others. In high-functioning BPD, you shield your conscious and unconscious anxieties and relational wound with a facade of normalcy.

In both cases, your deepest pain remains buried. Both your yearnings and fears remain unseen—not just to others but even yourself. While you may seem to function "normally" in your day-to-day life, inside you feel numb, as though you are running on an auto-pilot. The emptiness and loneliness wear on your conscience day after day, and however much you try to suppress it, from time to time you feel like you are on the verge of breaking.

4. Disorganized attachment

Children who have developed this style have been exposed to prolonged abuse and/or neglect. In a situation involving abuse, these primary caregivers are also a source of hurt; this creates enormous inner conflicts in the child, causing them to have to use mechanisms like splitting and dissociation to cope. If your attachment style is disorganized, you may relate to others in a chaotic, unpredictable way, or even perpetuate a vicious abusive cycle.

You may also have symptoms along the "traumatic-dissociative" dimension (TDD) (Farina, Liotti, and Imperatori 2019). For example, you may experience a "loss of continuity" with your experience, unexplained memory loss, or randomly "losing time." You may experience depersonalization—feeling disconnected with your own body—or derealisation, a sudden sense of disconnection with the world, like you are "floating above it."

Your coping styles are not inherently "bad" or wrong. If your parents were not to be trusted, withdrawal and hyper-vigilance might have been absolutely necessary for you. But it could gradually become a liability if the same approach is brought over to your adult relationships, even when there is a genuine loving presence around. This is the mechanism by which a once-necessary, desperate method to survive can become classifiable as a "mental disorder."

To complicate matters, many of us have mixed attachment patterns—so we may swing between various behavioral patterns, from distancing to clinging, controlling, or devaluing the relationship. Or we glorify our partner one day, then devalue them the next day. We swing from attaching intensely to distancing ourselves and armoring up heavily. This split partly explains the confusion we see amongst borderline personality disorder, including quiet borderline personality disorder and high-functioning borderline personality disorder. 

We often find ourselves repeating the same behaviors and patterns throughout our lives. Having an awareness of what is underneath your presentation can then help you move towards developing more securely attached relationships, and heal from the painful symptoms of BPD. Combining deep insights with time, you can certainly turn the situation around.

# Attachment disorder in adults: Symptoms, causes, and more

An attachment disorder is a behavioral disorder that affects the ability to form and maintain relationships. Attachment disorders are common in children but can occur in adults.

These disorders typically develop in childhood. They can result when a child is unable to have a consistent emotional connection with a parent or primary caregiver.

There is no formal attachment disorder diagnosis for adults, but they can experience attachment issues. These can stem from untreated or undiagnosed attachment disorders in childhood.

This article describes what attachment disorders are, including the types and their symptoms. We also explore the treatment options and when to see a doctor. 

Attachment theory deals with how people form emotional bonds. The way that a person learns to form and maintain relationships primarily stems from their initial interactions with a parent or primary caregiver during childhood. Experts suggest that genetics may also play an indirect role.

However, attachment disorders are distinct, diagnosable conditions.

The professional diagnostic guidelines — the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5-R) — lists two types of attachment disorders: reactive attachment disorder (RAD) and disinhibited social engagement disorder.

While RAD often occurs as a result of early childhood mistreatment or neglect, DSED often occurs following neglect in the first two years of life.

This section explains the two types of attachment disorder. However, it is worth noting that the criteria for each focuses on the symptoms in children.

RAD typically stems from early childhood maltreatment or neglect. In adolescents, this may present as:

If the child does not receive effective treatment, the symptoms of RAD may manifest or continue into adulthood. Possible symptoms of the disorder in adults include:

DSED may develop in response to social neglect and a lack of consistent attachment to a primary caregiver during the first 2 years of life. Children in social care often demonstrate symptoms of DSED. These may include:

If a child with DSED does not receive effective treatment, the issue can manifest or continue into adulthood. An adolescent or adult with DSED may display:

Having dissociative identity disorder (DID) involves having at least two distinct personality states. Medical experts previously referred to the condition as multiple personality disorder.

However, researchers do not yet fully understand the causes of dissociative conditions, and it is a controversial diagnosis. Some theories suggest that they may develop after sexual or emotional abuse in childhood.

DID affects 1–3% of the population, but the general symptoms of dissociation are more common.A person with DID is unaware of their alter personalities, or “alters.” The “primary” personality only realizes that they have lost time — during which the alters were present. There is also a loss of sense of self in the moment for the primary personality.

Below are some signs and symptoms of the disorder. Others may notice or the person may experience:

Here, learn more about dissociation.

An attachment disorder that develops in childhood may affect relationships in adulthood.

A person with an attachment disorder may have difficulty trusting others or feeling safe and secure in a relationship. As a result, they may have difficulty forming and maintaining friendships and romantic partnerships.

MR 11/13/23: I am not aware of research linking adult dissociation or substance misuse with those attachment disorders, unless the author has research they have found. Otherwise, I would not link those here.

Untreated childhood RAD or DSED can cause the following during adulthood: 

Currently, the DSM-5 does not recognize attachment disorders in adults, so an adult is unlikely to receive this diagnosis.

The treatment for a childhood attachment disorder typically involves psychotherapy — which may also benefit an adult who is experiencing a manifestation of the disorder.

An adult may find therapy or couples counseling useful. Attachment therapy focuses on helping a person overcome the impact of negative early experiences with attachment. It can also help create new, healthier attachment bonds.

Couples counseling can help people see how an attachment disorder may be affecting their relationship. With this knowledge and with the therapist’s help, couples can develop tools and strategies to strengthen their bond. 

The following are answers to frequently asked questions.

Untreated attachment disorders in childhood can cause a person to have low self-esteem, difficulty in social situations, and trouble maintaining relationships. They may also experience mental health conditions like anxiety and depression.

Psychotherapy helps a person identify and understand thoughts and behaviors that may be negatively affecting their relationships. Once a person has addressed these issues, they can develop tools and coping strategies that work.

For some people, therapy may help. Couples therapy can also be useful for people who are having difficulty in their relationships. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help a person change their thought patterns, behaviors, and actions.

A child who has experienced any form of neglect or maltreatment likely needs psychological support, regardless of whether they have an attachment disorder.

Anyone who feels that their thoughts or behaviors are negatively impacting their relationships should consider consulting a doctor or psychotherapist.

Also, any adult who has ever experienced maltreatment may benefit from discussing it with a therapist. Unresolved issues from the past may negatively impact life, emotions, and relationships. 

An adult is unlikely to receive a diagnosis of an attachment disorder because the clinical guidelines only recognize these issues in children.

Nonetheless, if a child with an attachment disorder does not receive effective treatment, the symptoms can manifest or continue into adulthood, causing difficulties with social interactions and relationships.

Another influential way of thinking about personality disorders stems from attachment theory. This theory is credited to John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth.  Like object relations theory, attachment theory proposes that people develop internal representations of relationships through their interactions with early caregivers. These internal representations, or working models of relationships, then go on to influence: 1) personality development, 2) social interaction tendencies, 3) expectations of the world and of other people and, 4) strategies for regulating emotions.

The theory separates these working models of relationships into two main categories, secure attachment and insecure attachment, according to the degree of safety and security present within the relationships represented by the models. The category of insecure attachment is further subdivided based on how children react to others as a result of their working models: ambivalent, avoidant, or disorganized.

Characteristic of these insecure attachment styles are behaviors that are overly clingy or proximity seeking (ambivalent attachment), or behaviors that are rejecting of the caregiver (avoidant attachment). Some insecurely attached children develop a disorganized attachment style, which is characterized by alternating back and forth between clingy behavior, then rejecting behaviors, coupled with a fear of the caregiver.

Attachment theory proposes that children's early relationships with caregivers should ideally give rise to a secure attachment. Secure attachment is formed by the provision of a secure base from which children can safely explore the world.  Trusted caregivers become a sort of "home base" or safe harbor from which children can safely venture out into their surrounding environment.  When feeling anxious, unsafe, and in need of comfort they can return to their "home base" as needed.

When children are upset, they are biologically programmed to seek protection and comfort from caregivers.  Caregivers who meet children's needs for protection and comfort do so by providing effective and appropriate soothing responses.  When caregivers model these effective soothing responses, this enables children to learn how to calm and soothe themselves.  Children's positive experiences of safety and comfort shape the formation of mental representations of themselves and others. These healthy representations are characterized by a basic sense of self-worth and of trust in other people (i.e., secure attachment).  Over time, through the trusted caregivers' consistent behavior, children learn to regulate their own affect. They learn to internalize a self-soothing, comforting coping strategy that previously took place in the space between caregiver and child.


In contrast, when caregivers are rejecting, cold, and inconsistent in response to children's needs, children do not experience caregivers as soothing and safe. They subsequently develop mental representations of relationships as unsafe and insecure (i.e., insecure attachment).  Little or no modeling of soothing behavior is offered within these insecure attachments. Whatever is offered cannot be trusted because it is inconsistently provided. So, children do not effectively learn how to regulate their own emotion or to soothe themselves.

Early maltreatment culminating in the formation of an insecure attachment style may cause children to become confused in their approach to relationships with caregivers and other authority figures.  They anticipate abuse or neglect. Thus, they are motivated to be cautious or avoidant, while simultaneously needing support and protection from the same people they wish to avoid.  This need motivates their approach for support or comfort. Unfortunately, this need is not met.

Such an incompatible and confusing mixture of interpersonal motivations may account for a behavioral pattern called approach-avoidance.  This style has been described in persons with Borderline Personality Disorders as, "Come close, No! Go away!"  An insecure attachment style does not constitute disorders in-and-of themselves. However, when combined with other biological and environmental risk factors such as abuse, they may contribute to the development of a personality disorder.

Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Schema Therapy incorporate certain elements of attachment theory.  Mentalization-Based Therapy (MBT) rests heavily upon attachment theory. The theoretical foundation of MBT follows in the next section.

# What Is the Link Between BPD and Attachment Style? - thewaveclinic.com

Borderline personality disorder may affect around 3% of young people. It’s characterised by an unstable sense of self and relationships with others that can make daily life difficult to manage. While BPD is a serious mental health disorder, it is treatable and with the right support, young people with BPD can live fulfilling, productive lives.

Researchers are not sure exactly why and how BPD develops, but they think it usually results from a complex interaction of biological, environmental, and psychosocial factors. The developmental journey looks different in every individual and may take a wide range of different paths.

In recent years, researchers have started to explore the links between BPD and attachment styles. Shaped by the way young child attaches to their parents, secure, insecure, and fearful attachment styles describe the way we form and maintain relationships with others. Some researchers have proposed that:

This blog offers some information about attachment theory and how it may explain some of the symptoms of BPD. It also provides an outline of treatment for the condition and how it can help young people to manage symptoms and build fulfilling futures.

Attachment styles are formed by the early interactions between a parent and their child. These first relationships have a huge impact on the emotional and social development of an infant, affecting the neurobiology of their brains and shaping the way they attach to others throughout the rest of childhood, adolescence, and into their adult lives. 

For a young child, attachment is fundamental to their survival. Infants are dependent on their parents or guardians to fulfil their every need, from feeding to shelter to protection. In secure attachments, a sensitive and caring caregiver responds to their child’s needs while the child seeks to stay close to them. 

Insecure attachment happens when a parent cannot adequately fulfil a young child’s needs. The child may become anxious, clinging to a parent and showing signs of intense desperation if they leave. In other cases, children tend towards avoidance, detaching from their parents and showing little attachment towards them. 

Some children also show a fearful (or disorganised) attachment style – an unstable pattern of behaviours that may fluctuate between anxious and avoidance tendencies. Fearful attachment may happen when a child is frightened of their parent or sees their parent as frightened, possibly interpreting themselves as the cause. They may experience a paradox of a caregiver who at times fulfils their needs, and others harms them, leading to a state of confusion and instability that seriously damages the healthy development of the attachment system.

In many cases, these attachment styles continue into adolescence and adulthood. Young people with avoidant attachment styles may be reluctant to form close relationships and avoid intimacy with others. Those with anxious styles may become controlling over another person, seeking to ensure that they do not leave. Teenagers and adolescents with disorganised attachment may rapidly switch between anxious and avoidant traits, sometimes clinging to another and at other times detaching.

While insecure attachments can have a huge impact on a young person’s life, change is possible. With therapeutic interventions and the formation of other, secure relationships, young people can start to understand the roots of their feelings towards others and learn how to develop secure attachments in the future.

In 2011, a group of researchers published a paper that explores the activation of the attachment system among people with BPD. 

They suggest that people living with the disorder often have a hyperactive attachment system that may have developed as a result of insecure attachments or the experience of traumatic events. Individuals with hyperactive attachment systems may quickly and intensely attach to another as though they are dependent on them for their survival. This may lead to some of the interpersonal difficulties associated with BPD, such as:

The paper also explores the idea of mentalisation and how this may relate to attachment. Mentalisation is the ability to imagine the mental states of yourself or others that underlie actions and behaviours. It’s the skill of ‘thinking about thinking’ – reflecting on why you (or others) might feel a certain way or do a certain thing. Mentalisation is an important part of maintaining healthy relationships, allowing you to empathise with the feelings of others and understand the reasons that people act in certain ways.

Young people with borderline personality disorder often have difficulty mentalising. They may think that if a person leaves for a short amount of time, they have left them forever and not consider that they have an intention to return. They may also be quick to act according to a certain feeling without considering that the feeling may be rooted in other factors and not present the best course of action.

The authors suggest that a hyperactive attachment system may be one of the reasons that people with BPD can struggle with mentalisation. When a person attaches strongly to another, experiencing very intense urges to be close to – or sometimes avoid – them, it may leave little space to take a step back and consider the mental patterns that underlie these feelings. 

Instead, they may feel overwhelmed by their affection, desires, and fears, and act following these emotions. They also suggest that, in some cases, this lack of mentalisation could be rooted in experiences of mistreatment as a child, who may be reluctant to consider the destructive thoughts and feelings a caregiver has towards them.

BPD can look very different from one young person to another. This means that it can be hard to generalise both the symptoms and underlying causes of the disorder. However, despite these difficulties, researchers have noticed certain core features that many people living with BPD experience. 

One of these observations is that many people living with BPD show patterns of anxious and disorganised attachment. They may have a painful intolerance of aloneness, an expectation of hostility from those around them, fewer positive memories of social interactions, and a hypersensitivity to their social environment. These traits, which cluster around insecure attachments, often seem to constitute some of the most significant characteristics of individuals living with the disorder.

Other studies have explored the role attachment styles may play in the development of BPD. One study found that children with insecure attachment and separation anxiety were more likely to show traits of the disorder. Another study found that teenagers who were overly close with their friends or untrusting of the world around them were more likely to show features of BPD.

Understanding the significance of insecure attachment among young people with BPD may help therapists and other mental health professionals treat the disorder. By working with young people to understand the roots of their attachment styles and developing the skills to form more secure attachments with others, young people may be able to manage and overcome many of the interpersonal difficulties associated with the condition. 

Borderline personality disorder is a serious condition that often affects many aspects of a young person’s life. It may affect their relationships with friends, family members, and partners, their performance at school, and their ability to care for themselves. As a result, treatment for the disorder usually involves a combination of different types of care from a range of professionals. These may include:

This team will focus on providing a young person with psychotherapy, as well as any other support that they require. 

There are several different kinds of therapy that can effectively treat BPD, helping young people understand and accept their emotions while learning skills that promote positive change. Treatment for BPD often involves group therapy sessions, providing the space for young people to develop meaningful and secure relationships with both their therapists and other people living with BPD.

Psychotherapy for BPD may include:

While BPD can make daily life feel difficult – or almost impossible –  for young people, they can get better. With effective treatment and secure care, they can learn to manage and overcome BPD symptoms and build fulfilling, hopeful futures.

Bullying involves deliberate harmful actions from one person or group of people to another, where there is a power imbalance between those bullying and those being bullied. This power imbalance may be physical or social, based on characteristics like popularity, social group, or age.

Childhood trauma is one of the most important risk factors for the development of BPD. Many instances of childhood trauma happen within the family environment, through relationships and interactions between a child and their caregivers. These experiences can have a big impact on a young person’s emotional and social development, affecting the way they manage emotions and form relationships with others. Experts think these changes may underpin key traits and features of BPD.

Therapy can help a young child to understand what is going on in their life and inner world. It can also give them tools to cope with the difficult thoughts, emotions, and other challenges they may be facing.

# Jack Ma - Wikipedia




Jack Ma Yun (Chinese: 马云; pinyin: Mǎ Yún; born September 10, 1964) is a Chinese business magnate, investor and philanthropist. He is the co-founder of Alibaba Group, a multinational technology conglomerate. In addition, Ma is also the co-founder of Yunfeng Capital, a Chinese private equity firm. As of February 2024[update], with a net worth of $30.1 billion, Ma is the sixth-wealthiest person in China, as well as the 50th wealthiest person in the world, ranked by Bloomberg Billionaires Index.[2]


Born in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Ma earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in English upon graduating from Hangzhou Normal University in 1988. He became an English lecturer and international trade lecturer at Hangzhou Dianzi University following graduation. The rise and expansion of the software and personal-computer industries during the 1980s captured Ma's attention, prompting him to develop an interest in the nascent internet industry. Demonstrating such a propensity led him into the realm of internet entrepreneurship where he embarked on establishing his first business in 1994, subsequently resulting in the formation of a second company upon acquiring a deeper understanding of the internet's emergence and the promising commercial prospects it offered. From 1998 to 1999, he resigned from China Telecommunications Corporation, later starting the Alibaba Group with his colleagues in 1999. The company was initially founded as a B2B e-commerce marketplace website, yet the company later expanded into a wide range of industry domains across the Chinese economy, including e-commerce, high-technology, and online payment solutions.


In 2017, Ma was ranked second in the annual "World's 50 Greatest Leaders" list by Fortune.[3] He has widely been considered as an informal global ambassador in Chinese business circles, and has continued to remain an influential figure in the Chinese business community and scene of startup companies.[4] In September 2018, he announced that he would retire from Alibaba and pursue educational work, philanthropy, and environmental causes;[5][6][7][8] the following year, Daniel Zhang succeeded him as executive chairman.[9][10] In 2020, the Chinese government stopped plans for an IPO called for the digital payment solutions company Ant Group, a company that he founded, after he delivered a speech that criticized Chinese financial regulators for putting too much priority in minimizing risk.[11][12]


In 2019, Forbes Magazine named Ma in its list of "Asia's 2019 Heroes of Philanthropy" for his humanitarian and philanthropic work supporting underprivileged communities in China, Africa, Australia, and the Middle East.[5][13] In April 2021, Jack Ma ranked 26th in the "2021 Forbes Global Rich List" with a fortune of $48.4 billion USD.[14] In July 2021, Jack Ma led Alibaba Group to top the 2021 China Charity List with a total cash donation of 3.22 billion yuan.[15]


Ma was born in Hangzhou, Zhejiang on September 10, 1964, as Ma Yun.[16] He became interested in learning the English language as a young boy and began practicing it with English-speaking visitors who frequented the Hangzhou International Hotel. Ma's grandfather served as a security guard during the Second Sino-Japanese War. At the age of 12, Ma bought a pocket radio and began listening to English radio stations frequently. For nine years, Ma rode 27 km (17 miles) on his bicycle every day to work as a tour guide of Hangzhou for foreigners in order to practice his English. He became pen pals with one of those foreigners, who nicknamed him "Jack" because he found it hard to pronounce his Chinese name.[17] When Ma was 13 years old, he was forced to transfer to Hangzhou No. 8 Middle School as he kept getting in fights. In his primary school days, Ma struggled scholastically, and it took two years for him to gain acceptance at an ordinary Chinese high school, as he only got 31 points in mathematics on the Chinese high school entrance exam.


In 1980, while he was riding his bike to practice English with tourists, he met Ken Morley, who was traveling with his family with the Australia-China Friendship Society.[18] Ken's son, David, became pen pals with Ma and kept in touch after the family left China. Years later, the Morleys hosted Ma in Australia, changing the course of his life completely. Ma later said: "Those 29 days in Newcastle were crucial in my life. Without those 29 days, I would never have been able to think the way I do today."[19]


In 1982, at the age of 18, Ma failed the nation-wide Chinese college entrance exam on his initial attempt, obtaining only 1 point in mathematics. Afterwards, he and his cousin applied to be waiters at a nearby hotel. His cousin was hired, but Ma was rejected on the grounds that he was "too skinny, too short, and in general, protruded a bad physical appearance that may have potentially ended up hurting the restaurant's image and possibly tarnishing its reputation."[20]


In 1983, Ma failed his college entrance exam for the second time.[21] However, his math score improved, increasing from his previous attempt to 19 points. The following year, Ma remained relentlessly determined to pursue higher education despite strong opposition from his family, who wanted him to choose a different career path as an alternative option. Undeterred, he decided to take the entrance exam a third time in 1984. On his third attempt, Ma scored 89 points on the math section, marking a significant improvement from his previous two attempts. Nonetheless, the minimum benchmark entrance requirement would have rendered Ma ineligible to be accepted into university, since his score was five points below the standardized minimum threshold for him to qualify.


However, Ma's academic fortunes would change since the enrollment target for prospective majors in Hangzhou Normal University's Department of English was not met, as some prospective students had the opportunity to be accepted and promoted into it, with Ma himself having ended up being promoted to the department's foreign language major. Having realized his aspirations to pursue higher education after enrolling at Hangzhou Normal University, Ma's academic performance began to improve substantially as he steadily achieved scholarly excellence over the course of his undergraduate studies. In recognition of his merits as evinced by his burgeoning academic achievements, Ma distinguished himself scholastically by consistently being ranked as among the top five students in Hangzhou Normal University's foreign language department due to the extensive English-language skills that he honed. He was also elected as the chairman of the student union and later became the chairman of the Hangzhou Federation of Students, with Ma having served in that capacity for two terms.[20]


In 1988, Ma earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Hangzhou Normal University.[22][23] After graduation, he became a lecturer in English and international trade at Hangzhou Dianzi University. Ma also claims to have applied to Harvard Business School ten times consecutively, only to have ended up being rejected every time in spite of his persistent efforts.[24]


According to Ma's autobiographical speech,[25] after graduating from Hangzhou Normal University in 1988, Ma applied for 31 different odd entry-level jobs and was rejected for every single one. "I went for a job with the KFC; they said, 'you're no good'", Ma told interviewer Charlie Rose. "I even went to KFC when it came to my city. Twenty-four people went for the job. Twenty-three were accepted. I was the only guy [rejected]...".[26][27] During this period, China was nearing the end of its first decade following Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms.


In 1994, Ma heard about the Internet and also started his first company,[28] Hangzhou Haibo Translation Agency (杭州海波翻譯社, Hángzhōu Hǎibō Fānyì Shè), an online Chinese translation agency. In early 1995, he travelled abroad to the United States on behalf of the Hangzhou municipal government with colleagues who had helped introduce him to the Internet.[28] Although he found information related to beer from many countries, he was surprised to find none from China. He also tried to search for general information about China and again was surprised to find none. So he and his friend created an "ugly" website pertaining to information regarding Chinese beer.[29] He launched the website at 9:40 am, and by 12:30 pm he had received emails from prospective Chinese investors wishing to know more about him and his website. This was when Ma realized that the Internet had something great to offer. In April 1995, Ma and his business partner He Yibing (a computer instructor), opened the first office for China Pages, and Ma started their second company. On May 10, 1995, the pair registered the domain chinapages.com in the United States. Within a span of three years, China Pages cleared approximately 5,000,000 RMB in profit which at the time was equivalent to US$642,998 (approximately $1.18 million today).


Ma began building websites for Chinese companies with the help of friends in the United States.[30] He said that "The day we got connected to the Web, I invited friends and TV people over to my house", and on a very slow dial-up connection, "we waited three and a half hours and got half a page", he recalled. "We drank, watched TV and played cards, waiting. But I was so proud. I proved the Internet existed".[31]


From 1998 to 1999, Ma headed an information technology company established by the China International Electronic Commerce Center, a department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. In 1999, he quit and returned to Hangzhou with his team to establish Alibaba, a Hangzhou-based business-to-business marketplace site in his apartment with a group of 18 friends.[32] He started a new round of venture development with 500,000 yuan.


In October 1999 and January 2000, Alibaba won a total of a $25 million foreign venture seed capital from the American investment bank, Goldman Sachs and the Japanese investment management conglomerate SoftBank.[28] The program was expected to improve the domestic Chinese e-commerce market and perfect an e-commerce platform for online Chinese enterprises to establish a presence for themselves to compete, especially fostering the growth of Chinese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as addressing challenges surrounding China's entrance into the World Trade Organization in 2001. Eventually, Alibaba began to show signs of profitability three years later as Ma wanted to improve the global e-commerce system. Since 2003, Ma established Taobao Marketplace, Alipay, Ali Mama and Lynx. After the rapid rise of Taobao, American e-commerce giant eBay offered to purchase the company. However, Ma rejected their offer, instead garnering support from Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang who offered a $1 billion investment in upfront capital for the potential purpose of expanding Alibaba's corporate operations.


Since 1999, Ma served as the executive chairman of Alibaba Group, which has remained one of China's most prominent high-technology holding companies in the two decades since it inception presiding over nine major subsidiaries: Alibaba.com, Taobao Marketplace, Tmall, eTao, Alibaba Cloud Computing, Juhuasuan, 1688.com, AliExpress.com, and Alipay. At the annual general meeting of shareholders for Alibaba.com in May 2010, Ma announced Alibaba Group would begin in 2010 to earmark 0.3% of annual revenue to environmental protection, particularly on water- and air-quality improvement projects. Of the future of Alibaba, he has said, "our challenge is to help more people to make healthy money, 'sustainable money', money that is not only good for themselves but also good for the society. That's the transformation we are aiming to make."[33]


Despite achieving massive entrepreneurial and investment success in the Chinese high-technology industry and the fact that Alibaba is a high-technology company, Ma was never a technical expert on computer technology nor did he possess the extensive breadth of executive managerial skills and background experience or depth of technical know-how that would have nonetheless otherwise qualified him to competently run a technology company or operate as an independent technology entrepreneur on his own. Even though Ma's formal educational background and extensive training was in English rather than in a technical subject, his dearth of technical expertise did not deter him from being able to competitively distinguish himself from the quintessential Chinese technology mogul. As Ma with his distinct profile stands out among his entrepreneurial contemporaries throughout the Chinese high-technology industry, many of whom typically have a foundational background in computer engineering and science as part of their formal academic training and educational makeup. Instead, Ma parlayed his educational background to use in an entrepreneurial context by fashioning himself as a promoter, businessman, manager, administrator, and organizer who possessed the soft skills, emotional capacity, and personality with a knack for leading and employing specialists of expert ability from every conceivable technical domain. At a press conference in 2010, Ma made clear with regards to the lack of his technical expertise by revealing to the public that he had never written a line of computer code, nor had ever made one sale to a customer, and that he only acquired a personal computer to do business with for the first time at the age of 33.[34]


In 2011, it was announced that one of his companies had gained control of Alipay, formerly a subsidiary of Alibaba Group, so as to "comply with Chinese law governing payment companies in order to secure a license to continue operating Alipay.[35] Numerous analysts reported that Ma sold Alipay to himself below market value without notifying the board of Alibaba Group or the other major owners Yahoo and Softbank, while Ma stated that Alibaba Group's board of directors were aware of the transaction. The ownership dispute was resolved by Alibaba Group, Yahoo! and Softbank in July 2011.[36]
In November 2012, Alibaba's online transaction volume exceeded one trillion yuan. Ma stepped down as the chief executive officer of Alibaba on May 10, 2013, but remained as the executive chairman of the corporation. In September 2014, it was reported that Alibaba was raising over $25 billion in an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange.[37] As of 2016[update], Ma is the owner of Château de Sours in Bordeaux, Chateau Guerry in Côtes de Bourg and Château Perenne in Blaye, Côtes de Bordeaux.[38]


On January 9, 2017, Ma met with United States President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower, to discuss the potential of 1 million job openings in the following five years through the expansion of the presence of Alibaba's business interests in the United States.[39] On September 8, 2017, to celebrate Alibaba's 18th year of its establishment, Ma appeared on stage and gave a Michael Jackson-inspired performance. He also performed a partial rendition of Elton John's 1994 hit single Can You Feel The Love Tonight while being dressed up as a lead heavy metal singer at a 2009 Alibaba birthday event.[40] In the same month, Ma also partnered with Hong Kong business tycoon, Sir Li Ka-shing in a joint venture to offer a digital wallet service in Hong Kong.[41]


Ma announced on September 10, 2018, that he would step down as executive chairman of Alibaba Group Holding in the coming year.[42] Ma denied reports that he was forced to step aside by the Chinese government[43] and stated that he wants to focus on philanthropy through his foundation.[44] Daniel Zhang would then lead Alibaba as the current executive chairman.[45][10] Ma stepped down from the board of Alibaba on October 1, 2020.[46]


News outlets noted a lack of public appearances from Ma between October 2020 and January 2021, coinciding with a regulatory crackdown on his businesses.[47] The Financial Times reported that the disappearance may have been connected to a speech given at the annual People's Bank of China financial markets forum,[48] in which Ma criticized China's regulators and banks.[48] Ma described state banks as operating with a pawn shop mentality and criticized the Basel Accords as a "club for the elderly."[49]: 50 


On November 3, 2020, the Shanghai Stock Exchange halted Ant Group's IPO.[49]: 50  According to Chinese bankers and officials, financial stability was the objective behind the intervention.[48] Ant Group had sought to maintain a position as a technology company, although it was deriving approximately 90% of its revenue from financial services.[49]: 50  This position brought it into conflict with the People's Bank of China (PBOC), which since 2018 had sought to regulate Ant Group as a financial holding company.[49]: 50  After Ant Group filed for its IPO, PBOC had issued draft guidelines stating that it would regulate companies such as Ant Group as financial services companies, not tech companies.[49]: 51  During the IPO, financial regulators became even more concerned about Ant Group due to its high valuation as a tech company, increasing fears of a bubble.[49]: 51 


Ma made a public appearance again on January 20, 2021, speaking via video link to a group of rural teachers at a charitable event, the annual Rural Teacher Initiative.[47][50]


In November 2022, Ma was reportedly living a low profile life in Tokyo, Japan, for nearly six months, and occasionally traveling abroad.[51] In March 2023, photos and videos of Ma touring the Yungu school in Hangzhou, China appeared on social media confirming the public appearance of the billionaire for the first time in several months. The school is funded by Alibaba and is located near the company's headquarters.[52] He was reportedly persuaded to return from abroad by premier Li Qiang.[53] In the same month, Alibaba Group turned into a holding company and its subsidiaries would separate into six independent firms; The Wall Street Journal reported on 30 March that Ma engineered this in talks with company CEO Daniel Zhang while he was traveling overseas.[54]


Ant Group made major changes to its ownership structure and corporate governance in January 2023.[49]: 261  That month, Ant Group announced a series of changes in shareholder voting rights, and its founder Jack Ma will no longer be the actual controller of Ant Group.[55] Ma's voting rights were reduced from 50% to 6%.[49]: 271  Following these changes, no single shareholder has a controlling stake in the company.[49]: 261  The company's board also added another independent director.[49]: 261  The Chinese government spoke positively of Ant Group's changes, including describing them as improvements in transparency and accountability.[49]: 261 


In early 2024, Ma replaced SoftBank as Alibaba's largest shareholder.[56]


In May 2023, Tokyo College, a research institute at the University of Tokyo, announced that Ma had been appointed a Visiting Professor and would work at the institute until at earliest October 2023.[57] His research focus would include sustainable agriculture, food production, and lectures on entrepreneurship. The Financial Times described the announcement as "a rare public statement of the billionaire's commitments outside China."[58]


In 2017, Ma made his acting debut with his first kung fu short film Gong Shou Dao, directed by Wen Zhang and produced by Jet Li. The film stars Ma, Li, Donnie Yen, Wu Jing, Tony Jaa, Jacky Heung, Asashōryū Akinori, Zou Shiming, and Natasha Liu Bordizzo. It was filmed in collaboration with the Double 11 Shopping Carnival Singles' Day. In the same year, he also participated in a singing festival and performed dances during Alibaba's 18th-anniversary party.[59][60][61]


In November 2020, in the finale of Africa’s Business Heroes, Ma was replaced as a judge in the television show, with Alibaba executive Peng Lei taking his place, reportedly "Due to a schedule conflict".[62]


Ma is an adherent of both Buddhism and Taoism.[87][88][89]


On September 24, 2014, in an interview with Taobao, Ma attributed the strength of American society to the country being rooted in its Judeo-Christian heritage and expressed his belief in the importance for China to implement a positive value system in order to overcome the aftermath and legacy of the bygone Cultural Revolution.[90]


In November 2018, the People's Daily identified Ma as a member of the Chinese Communist Party, something which surprised observers.[91][92][93]


Ma received international criticism after he publicly endorsed the Chinese work practice known as the 996 working hour system.[94] When asked in 2019 to give his views on the future, Ma again stated that 996 was currently a "huge blessing" necessary to achieve success, but went on to state that artificial intelligence technology might lead to a better life of leisure in the future, where people would only have to work four-hour work days, three days a week.[95][96] At the same time, Ma expressed skepticism that AI could ever completely replace people, referencing to his theory that success requires a "love quotient" and stating that machines can never match this success. Ma also predicted that population collapse would become a big problem in the future.[97][98]


Jack Ma is the founder of the Jack Ma Foundation, a philanthropic organization focused on improving education, the environment and public health.[99]


In 2008, Alibaba donated $808,000 to victims of the Sichuan earthquake.[100] In 2009 Jack Ma became a trustee of The Nature Conservancy's China program, and in 2010 he joined the global Board of Directors of the organization.[101]


In 2015, Alibaba launched a nonprofit organization, Alibaba Hong Kong Young Entrepreneurs Foundation, which supports Hong Kong entrepreneurs to help them grow their businesses.[102][103] In the same year, the company funded the rebuilding of 1,000 houses damaged by the earthquake-hit in Nepal, and raised money for another 9,000.[104]
In 2015 he also founded the Hupan School,[105] a business school.


In September 2018, Ma started the Jack Ma Foundation and announced that he would retire from Alibaba to pursue educational work, philanthropy, and environmental causes.[5][6][7][8]


In 2019, Forbes named Ma in its list of "Asia's 2019 Heroes of Philanthropy" and awarded him the Malcolm S. Forbes Lifetime Achievement Award for his work supporting underprivileged communities in China, Africa, Australia, and the Middle East.[5][13]



In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Alibaba Foundation and Jack Ma Foundation launched various initiatives, some of which involved donating medical supplies to the United States as well as various countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe.[106][107]

Alibaba founder Jack Ma on Wednesday praised the company's reorganization and change over its tumultuous past year, marking the billionaire's second major public statement to employees in just a few months.

In the past year, Alibaba underwent a historic overhaul and sweeping management changes in a bid to return the Chinese technology giant to growth.

"Over the past year, amid external and internal doubt and pressures, I have witnessed the birth of a strong and courageous Alibaba team," Ma wrote in an internal memo to employees, a translated version of which was seen by CNBC.

Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares were nearly 2% higher in morning trading Wednesday.

Ma all but disappeared from public life at the end of 2020, after Chinese regulators pulled the plug on the massive listing of the founder's financial affiliate Ant Group, sparking a crackdown on his empire.

Alibaba, whose business spans everything from e-commerce to cloud computing, has seen billions of dollars wiped off of its value in the past few years, thanks to tougher regulation from Beijing and rising competition from rivals like PDD and TiKTok owner ByteDance.

Last year, Alibaba underwent its biggest overhaul in its history, which split the company into six business groups in a bid to make each unit more agile.

This was accompanied by sweeping management changes. Daniel Zhang, longtime CEO of Alibaba Group, unexpectedly quit and then stepped down as CEO of the company's cloud unit. Alibaba veterans Eddie Yongming Wu took over as CEO, while Joe Tsai became chairman in September.

Alibaba has since scrapped the initial public offerings of both its cloud division and Cainiao, its logistics unit.

Ma is reemerging at a time when Alibaba employees are likely in need of a morale boost. He praised both Tsai and Wu for their "future-oriented transformations."

The Alibaba founder also said Alibaba needs to think what e-commerce looks like in three years' time, especially since the arrival of artificial intelligence.

# The Life of Jack Ma: the Billionaire Who Created and Founded Alibaba - Business Insider

Jack Ma, Alibaba and Ant Group founder, has been making moves during the last year after a lengthy hiatus. 

Ma, who disappeared from public view in 2020 and resurfaced in Thailand in January 2023, most recently made news when The New York Times reported in January of this year that he had been buying up Alibaba shares again.

Ma faced a crackdown from Chinese regulators in 2020 that resulted in an antitrust investigation, a suspended IPO, and Ma losing $12 billion of his fortune in just a few months. 

However, Ma quietly made moves throughout 2023, including a teaching gig at Tokyo College, investing in an agrotech startup, and incorporating a pre-packaged food company.

According to Bloomberg, his net worth is now estimated at $30.6 billion. In July 2023, China hit Ant Group with a nearly $1 billion fine, marking the end of its crackdown, The Wall Street Journal reported.

While Ma has had a challenging few years, adversity is nothing new to him. He grew up poor in communist China, failed his university entrance exam twice, and was rejected from dozens of jobs, including one at KFC, before finding success with his third internet company, Alibaba.

Here's how Ma got his start and made his fortune.

Jillian D'Onfro, Charles Clark, and Taylor Nicole Rogers contributed to an earlier version of this post.

Jack Ma — born Ma Yun — was born on September 10, 1964, in Hangzhou, southeastern China. He has an older brother and a younger sister, USA Today reported.

 

He and his siblings grew up at a time when communist China was increasingly isolated from the West, and his family didn't have much money when they were young, per 60 Minutes.

Ma was scrawny and often got into fights with classmates. "I was never afraid of opponents who were bigger than I," he recalls in "Alibaba," a book by Liu Shiying and Martha Avery.

As a kid, Ma liked collecting crickets and making them fight, and was able to distinguish the size and type of cricket just by the sound it made, according to USA Today.

When he became a teen, he offered travelers tours of his city in exchange for English lessons. That's how ended up with the nickname Jack, 60 Minutes reported.

 

After high school, he applied to go to college — but failed the entrance exam twice. He finally passed on the third try, going on to attend Hangzhou Teachers Institute. At the World Economic Forum in 2016, Ma revealed he has been rejected from Harvard— 10 times.

He graduated in 1988 and started applying to as many jobs as he could.

He received more than a dozen rejections — including from KFC — before being hired as an English teacher at a university. Ma was a natural with his students and loved his job — though he only made $12 a month at a local university.

 

 

 

Ma married Zhang Ying, a teacher he met at school after they graduated in the late 1980s. They have two children — a daughter and a son, according to Bloomberg.

 

Ma had no experience with computers or coding, but he was captivated by the internet when he used it for the first time during a trip to the US in 1995. He had recently started a translation business and made the trip to help a Chinese firm recover a payment.

Ma's first online search was "beer," but he was surprised to find that no Chinese beers turned up in the results. It was then that he decided to found an internet company for China.

 

Though his first two ventures failed, four years later, he gathered 17 of his friends in his apartment and convinced them to invest in his vision for an online marketplace he called "Alibaba." The site allowed exporters to post product listings that customers could buy directly.

Soon, the service started to attract members from all over the world. By October 1999, the company had raised $5 million from Goldman Sachs and $20 million from SoftBank, a Japanese telecom company that also invests in technology companies.

The team remained close-knit and scrappy. "We will make it because we are young and we never, never give up," Ma said to a gathering of employees.

He was known for maintaining a sense of fun at Alibaba. In the early 2000s, when the company decided to start Taobao, its eBay competitor, he had his team do handstands during breaks to keep their energy levels up.

When the company first became profitable, Ma gave each employee a can of Silly String to go wild with.

 

In 2005, Yahoo invested $1 billion in Alibaba in exchange for about a 40% stake in the company. This was huge for Alibaba — at the time it was trying to beat eBay in China — and it would eventually be an enormous win for Yahoo too, netting it $10 billion in Alibaba's IPO alone, TechCrunch reported.

 

Alibaba went public on the New York Stock Exchange on September 19, 2014.

The company's $150 billion IPO was the largest offering for a US-listed company in the history of the NYSE. It also made Ma the richest person in China, with an estimated worth of $25 billion at the time, Bloomberg reported.

"Today what we got is not money. What we got is the trust from the people," Ma told CNBC at the time.

Ma stayed on as chairman at Alibaba until 2019. That year it was reported he 

 

Alibaba reported in 2022 that Ma owned 3.7% of the company both directly and through holding companies, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Ma owns a 10% stake in payment-processing service Alipay, which rebranded to Ant Group in 2014, according the company's prospectus filing in 2020.

 

According to Fortune, Ma developed an interest in environmentalism when a member of his wife's family became sick with an illness that Ma suspected was caused by pollution.

He sat on the global board of The Nature Conservancy and spoke during a session of the Clinton Global Initiative in 2015. He was also, according to Fortune, instrumental in funding a 27,000-acre nature reserve in China.

 

It's also known as the Global Shopping Festival in Alibaba reports, and it takes place on November 11. In 2021, the e-commerce giant reported nearly $85 million on Singles' Day. Taylor Swift performed at the company's Singles' Day event in 2019.

 

 

Alibaba's success may have made Ma an extremely wealthy man, but he still has some pretty modest hobbies.

"I don't think he has changed much, he is still that old style," Xiao-Ping Chen, a friend of Ma, told USA Today. He likes reading and writing kung fu fiction, playing poker, meditating, and practicing​ tai chi.

Ma once told employees at a press conference in 2014 that he hoped they use their newfound wealth to become "a batch of genuinely noble people, a batch of people who are able to help others, and who are kind and happy."

Even though Ma has kept his humble hobbies, he has also splurged on a French chateau and a plane for Alibaba.

Ma bought a vineyard and a chateau in Bordeaux, France, in 2016, according to CNBC. And in March 2013, Alibaba spent a reported $49.7 million on a Gulfstream G550, mostly for Ma's use, according to China Daily.

 

 

Despite Trump's protectionist attitude towards trade, Ma said China and the United States were not about to be drawn into a trade war.

"Give Trump some time. He's open-minded," Ma told a panel at the World Economic Forum in January 2017.

 

Crowds of people show up to listen to him speak. The company also hosts annual talent shows, and Ma is a natural entertainer. At a company anniversary event, he dressed up as a punk rocker for a performance in front of 20,000 Alibaba employees, according to 60 Minutes.

In 2014, Ma told Bloomberg he knew Alibaba had made it big when another customer offered to pay his restaurant bill.

The customer, Ma said in the interview, had left Ma a note that read: "I'm your customer of Alibaba group, I made a lot of money and I know you don't make any money. I'll pay the bill for you.".

 

He left the position on September 10, 2019. The company threw him a farewell party in an 80,000-seat stadium in Hangzhou, and Ma performed with other Alibaba executives.

Ma picked Daniel Zhang, who was named the CEO of Alibaba in 2015, to replace him as chairman. According to CNN Business, Ma decided to pivot to full-time philanthropy.

 

When the coronavirus pandemic brought the world to a halt in March 2020, Ma sourced and shipped N95 face masks and COVID-19 testing kits to over 100 countries dealing with shortages, including the US.

 

"Stepping down from SoftBank Group's Board, I believe, and he said to me actually, was something that he decided on his own," SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said during the firm's earnings announcement.

"That's sad, but we still keep in contact directly, and right before the COVID-19, we met face-to-face every month to have dinner, to talk about businesses, to talk about lives. And we will remain friends for the rest of our life, I believe."

 

Ant Group was expected to raise $37 billion with a valuation reportedly surpassing $300 billion. But then, Ma publicly snubbed China's financial regulatory system, calling it "an old people's club."

Soon after, regulators introduced new online lending rules that directly impacted Ant's business.

Officials then said there were "major issues" with Ant's listing, and by November 2020, the IPO was suspended.

It was expected to serve as a "stamp of approval" for disruptors in the traditional banking sector before the new rules changed the IPO's trajectory.

Regulators said they were launching an anti-monopoly investigation into Alibaba and held talks about stricter financial regulations with Ant Group.

As part of the investigation, China's State Administration for Market Regulation looked into the contracts Alibaba asked sellers to sign.

 

In January 2021, Yahoo Finance reported that Ma hadn't been seen publicly in more than two months and had been replaced as a judge on the TV talent show he founded, which raised the question of whether Ma had gone missing.

Ma isn't the first Chinese businessman to disappear from the public eye under such circumstances.

Ma's absence mirrored similar situations where Chinese businessmen had disappeared after battling with regulators.

But multiple sources said that Ma was not missing — he was simply "laying low" amid the government scrutiny and new regulations.




A post shared by JAY FAI (เจ๊ไฝ)⭐️ (@jayfaibangkok)


Jay Fai restaurant in Bangkok, Thailand, posted a photo of Jack Ma on Instagram. The caption read: "Incredibly humble, we are honored to welcome you and your family to Jay Fai's."

His reappearance came as Ant Group said it was streamlining voting rights to prevent any one shareholder from having a controlling vote.

 

Once China's richest man, Ma's net worth has fallen by more than $20 billion since he disappeared from public view, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

In November, Forbes reported that Ma was the seventh richest man in China in 2023 behind businessman Robin Zeng.

 

It's unclear if Ma is still teaching, but he was expected to conduct research on sustainable agriculture and food production. Tokyo College said that Ma would "share his rich experience and pioneering knowledge on entrepreneurship, corporate management and innovation" with students, according to the May announcement.

 

In the meeting, Ma suggested cutting out managers at Taobao and Tmall to combat the "very severe" competition the e-commerce platforms face. Other tech giants, particularly those in Silicon Valley, have also gotten rid of middle managers.

China's crackdown on technology firms appeared to be coming to an end after regulators issued a $1 billion fine to Ant Group in July, according to WSJ.

 

 

It appears that while Ma was out of the public eye, he was studying agrotech. As of July 2023, Hangzhou Dajingtou No. 22 Arts and Culture Co., one of Ma's investment-holdings companies, has a 10% stake in 1.8 Meters Marine Technology (Zhejiang) Co, an agrotech startup.

 

Ma's latest company reportedly deals with the sales of pre-packaged food and processing and selling agricultural products. But, Ma hasn't shared much about his desire to move into agriculture.

"I found that a place that does well in agriculture is not necessarily a place with good resources, but a place with unique thinking and people with imagination," he said during a speech to teachers last August.

He added, "The rural areas do need technology, while I think unique thinking and creativity are important as well."

Alibaba's stock began to rally in January after Ma reversed his plans to sell his shares and invested more in the company instead.

Ma spent $50 million on Alibaba's Hong Kong-listed shares over the last few months of 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported. The tech giant's stock started slipping in November, prompting Ma to rethink his plan of investing in his other business ventures over Alibaba.

In February, The Business Times reported that Zhang Ying, a Singaporean citizen, bought three properties known as shophouses in the Tanjong Pagar area of Singapore.

The three-story shophouses are reportedly situated on commercial-zoned sites, and this type of real estate is popular in Singapore, according to Bloomberg. The shophouses are said to be nearly done with refurbishments, and at least one story will be a restaurant.

# Learn Psychology For Free

The reason that you can now learn university taught psychology for free is that an increasing number of psychology lecturers and academic institutions are disseminating their ideas, research findings and course materials through a creative commons license. The aim of this page, therefore is to showcase only the very best and most comprehensive freely available educational materials.



With this in mind, I'm delighted to be able to showcase an outstanding Introduction to Psychology course delivered by Professor Paul Bloom from Yale University. Whether you teach psychology, are new to psychology, currently studying or thinking about studying psychology, I hope you find the material featured below as interesting and useful as I did.



All the very best,



David Webb BSc (Hons), MSc

Yale University psychology Professor Paul Bloom is a world renowned expert in how children and adults understand the physical and social world, particularly in relation to morality, religion, fiction, and art. He has won numerous awards for his research and teaching. He is past-president of the Society for Philosophy and Psychology, and co-editor of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, one of the major journals in the field.

Dr. Bloom has written for scientific journals such as Nature and Science, and for popular outlets such as The New York Times, the Guardian, and the Atlantic. He is the author of several books, including 'How Pleasure Works: Why we like what we like,' 'Just Babies: The Origins of Good and Evil' and 'Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion.'

Dr. Bloom has written for scientific journals such as Nature and Science, and for popular outlets such as The New York Times, the Guardian, and the Atlantic. He is the author of several books, including 'How Pleasure Works: Why we like what we like,' 'Just Babies: The Origins of Good and Evil' and 'Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion.'

What do your dreams mean? Do men and women differ in the nature and intensity of their sexual desires? Can apes learn sign language? Why can’t we tickle ourselves? This course tries to answer these questions and many others, providing a comprehensive overview of the scientific study of thought and behavior. It explores topics such as perception, communication, learning, memory, decision-making, religion, persuasion, love, lust, hunger, art, fiction, and dreams. We will look at how these aspects of the mind develop in children, how they differ across people, how they are wired-up in the brain, and how they break down due to illness and injury.

Professor Paul Bloom welcomes students and presents the course as a comprehensive introduction to the study of the human mind. Course readings and requirements are discussed. The five main branches of psychology are presented: neuroscience, which is a study of the mind by looking at the brain; developmental, which focuses on how people grow and learn; cognitive, which refers to the computational approach to studying the mind; social, which studies how people interact; and clinical, which examines mental health and mental illnesses.

This lecture introduces students to two broad theories of how the mind relates to the body. Dualism is the ubiquitous and intuitive feeling that our conscious mind is separate from our physical bodies, whereas Materialism is the idea that all of our mental states are caused by physical states of the brain. Dr. Bloom reviews arguments explaining why materialism has become the predominant theory of mind in psychology. This discussion is followed by a basic overview of the neurophysiology of the brain.

This lecture introduces students to the theories of Sigmund Freud, including a brief biographical description and his contributions to the field of psychology. The limitations of his theories of psychoanalysis are covered in detail, as well as the ways in which his conception of the unconscious mind still operate in mainstream psychology today.

Professor Bloom opens with a brief discussion of the value and evolutionary basis of unconscious processing. The rest of this lecture introduces students to the theory of Behaviorism, particularly the work of prominent behaviorist, B. F. Skinner. Different types of learning are discussed in detail, as well as reasons why behaviorism has been largely displaced as an adequate theory of human mental life.

This lecture explores issues and ideas related to the branch of psychology known as cognitive development. It begins with an introduction of Piaget who, interested in the emergence of knowledge in general, studied children and the way they learn about the world in order to formulate his theories of cognitive development. This is followed by an introduction to the modern science of infant cognition. Finally, the question of the relationship between and the existence of different kinds of development is addressed.

One of the most uniquely human abilities is the capacity for creating and understanding language. This lecture introduces students to the major topics within the study of language: phonology, morphology, syntax and recursion. This lecture also describes theories of language acquisition, arguments for the specialization of language, and the commonalities observed in different languages across cultures.

This lecture finishes the discussion of language by briefly reviewing two additional topics: communication systems in non-human primates and other animals, and the relationship between language and thought. The majority of the lecture is then spent on introducing students to major theories and discoveries in the fields of perception, attention and memory. Topics include why we see certain visual illusions, why we don't always see everything we think we see, and the relationship between different types of memory.

In this lecture, Professor Bloom reviews the basic psychological research on memory. Specific topics covered include the different memory types, memory limitations, strategies that improve memory, and memory disorders. This lecture also includes a discussion of several important social implications for memory research, such as recovered memories, and the influence of suggestibility on eyewitness testimony.

Guest lecturer Peter Salovey, Professor of Psychology and Dean of Yale College, introduces students to the dominant psychological theories of love and attraction. Specific topics include the different types of love, the circumstances that predict attraction, and the situations where people mistakenly attribute arousal for love.

In this lecture, Professor Bloom introduces students to the study of psychology from an evolutionary perspective, the idea that like the body, natural selection has shaped the development of the human mind. Prominent arguments for and against the theory of natural selection and its relationship to human psychology are reviewed. Students will hear several examples of how studying mental phenomenon from an evolutionary perspective can help constrain theories in psychology as well as explain many prevalent human instincts that underlie many of our most basic behaviors and decisions.

This lecture is an introduction to the evolutionary analysis of human emotions, how they work, why they exist, and what they communicate. In particular, this lecture discusses three interesting case studies, that of happiness (e.g., smiling), fear and the emotions we feel towards our relatives. Finally, this lecture ends with a brief discussion of babies' emotional responses to their caregivers.

Professor Bloom continues the discussion of emotions as useful evolutionary adaptations for dealing with our social environment. In particular, this lecture describes evolutionary explanations for several important emotional responses, such as the love between parents and their offspring, the gratitude we feel towards cooperative behaviors, the spite we feel for cheaters, and the cultural differences in feelings of revenge.

Why are people different from one another? This lecture addresses this question by reviewing the latest theories and research in psychology on two traits in particular: personality and intelligence. Students will hear about how these traits are measured, why they may differ across individuals and groups, and whether they are influenced at all by one's genes, parents or environment. Personality psychology studies the differences in people's behavior by attempting to accurately measure traits and characteristics based on past behavior."

In this lecture, Professor Bloom reviews what evolutionary theories and recent studies in psychology can tell us about sex and gender differences. Students will hear how psychology can help explain many of the differences that exist in whom we find attractive, what we desire in a mate, and sexual orientation.

Professor Bloom provides an introduction to psychological theories of morality. Students will learn how research in psychology has helped answer some of the most central questions about human morality. For instance, which emotions are "moral" and why did these moral feelings evolve? What factors guide our moral judgments? And what factors predict when good people will do bad things?

This is the first of two lectures on social psychology, the study of how we think about ourselves, other people, and social groups. Students will hear about the famous "six degrees of separation" phenomenon and how it illuminates important individual differences in social connectedness. This lecture also reviews a number of important biases that greatly influence how we think of ourselves as well as other people.

This lecture begins with the second half of the discussion on social psychology. Students will learn about several important factors influencing how we form impressions of others, including our ability to form rapid impressions about people. This discussion focuses heavily upon stereotypes, including a discussion of their utility, reliability, and the negative effects that even implicit stereotypes can incur.



The second half of the lecture introduces students to two prominent mysteries in the field of psychology. First, students will learn what is known and unknown about sleep, including why we sleep, the different types of sleep, disorders, and of course, dreams, what they are about and why we have them. Second, this half reviews how laughter remains a mysterious and interesting psychological phenomenon. Students will hear theories that attempt to explain what causes us to laugh and why, with a particular emphasis on current evolutionary theory

Guest lecturer Professor Susan Nolen-Hoeksema describes how modern clinical psychology both identifies and treats various mental disorders. Particular focus is placed upon mood disorders such as bipolar disorder and depression, including current diagnostic criteria and current practices for treatment.

In this lecture, Professor Bloom continues to explore psychopathology/clinical psychology. Following a discussion of the different ways of defining mental illness, Professor Bloom reviews several classes of clinical diagnoses including schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, dissociative disorders, and personality disorders. The lecture concludes with a brief introduction to therapy.

The last lecture in the course wraps up the discussion of clinical psychology with a discussion of treatment efficacy. Does therapy actually work? Professor Bloom summarizes the different types of influences that clinical interventions might have on people who receive therapy.

Professor Bloom ends with a review of one of the most interesting research topics in "positive psychology," happiness. What makes us happy? How does happiness vary across person and culture? What is happiness for? Students will hear how the most recent research in psychology attempts to answer these questions and learn how people are surprisingly bad at predicting what will make them happiest.

The most 'important and greatest puzzle' we face as humans is ourselves (Boring, 1950, p. 56). Humans are a puzzle, one that is complex, subtle and multi-layered, and it gets even more complicated as we evolve over time and change within different contexts. 
When answering the question 'what makes us who we are?' psychologists put forward a range of explanations about why people feel, think and behave the way they do. Just when psychologists seem to understand one bit of 'who we are' up pops some new evidence to show a different side! It is not easy to pin down all the many influences. This free course, Starting with psychology, makes a start.

# Learn psychology at the beginner's level | Udemy







































Hello Everyone! Psychology is a subject that gives a lot of information about ourselves. It's Human Specific. Isn't it interesting to know about ourselves at our deepest level? We all are aware about many things such as How does the mobile work? Or what are its features? and what are the societal norms? But are we aware about What is Human Mind? and How does it function?and How it enables us to function in our day to day activities. Psychology is the study of Human Mind. It gives us a very different perspective of looking at the World.

As an IB Educator, I am fueled by a profound passion for teaching, a commitment that goes beyond imparting knowledge to fostering a transformative educational experience. Among the various subjects I engage with, Psychology holds a special place in my heart, serving as a continuous source of inspiration for self-discovery at the deepest levels.

Exploring the intricate facets of Psychology has been a journey marked by curiosity and a thirst for understanding the complexities of the human mind. Beyond my role as an educator, I have delved into specialized areas within Psychology, undertaking courses such as Family and Marital Therapy and Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy. These pursuits have enriched my understanding of human behavior and the intricate dynamics within relationships, providing valuable insights that I incorporate into my teaching philosophy.

Moreover, I am proud to be a certified Positive Psychology Coach, a designation that aligns seamlessly with my educational approach. Positive Psychology, with its focus on well-being, strengths, and the cultivation of a positive mindset, resonates deeply with my teaching philosophy. It allows me to instill not only academic knowledge but also to nurture the holistic development of my students.

Listen to this article

In This Article

The terms Like and love are normally used interchangeably, but these two terms are different. Of course, there can be gray areas when interpreting your feelings for somebody, but it’s essential to know where you stand.

So how do you differentiate both terms? Like vs. love is not a hard concept to grasp if you know the meaning of both terms.               

                       

It is easy to wonder what does it mean when you like someone?

Liking someone simply entails being attracted to them on a physical or superficial level. Liking someone boils down to pleasure. What can they offer you, how they make you feel, and so on?

When you like someone, it is not exactly about them as it is about you. When you like a person, YOU come first. So you’re more focused on how they treat and care for you. 

What exactly is love, and why is this word so hard to deduce? Scientists over the years have conducted various research to dissect the meaning of this word. Even The National Institutes of Health is conducting 18 trials to discover the meaning of love.

So, what does love mean? Love is simply a strong feeling of emotions for another person or an intense feeling of deep affection.  It is the ability to feel positively towards another.

When you love someone, you have their best interest at heart; love is selfless. Loving someone is simply accepting them for who they are, their flaws, and imperfections. You’re interested in building a real commitment with them and creating a connection with them.

Watch this video to know the meaning of love:



The difference between like and love is hard to comprehend as each concept involves having feelings for another person. However, these concepts differ, and to decipher the feeling you have, you need to know the difference between like and love.

Keep reading to understand like vs. love properly. Irrespective of your feelings for someone, this article tells you where you stand, is it like or love? 

Liking someone involves physical attraction. When somebody likes you, it doesn’t extend beyond your physical appearance. They are attracted to the colors of your eyes or your body. But love extends beyond physical attraction; somebody that loves you is also attracted to your soul.

Their love for you includes who you’re down to your core, not just your physical attributes. Love is profound and also includes the little things. For example, your partner will love your laugh and work ethic and even just having you around.

They love you for who you are and not only how you look.

Moving on from the person is a piece of cake when you like someone. Their absence in your life wouldn’t make much of a difference. You might even start dating weeks after the breakup. This doesn’t mean they meant nothing to you; after all, you liked them.

Rather it means their feelings for you were superficial.

Love: it is hard to move on

On the other hand, it is difficult to forget about them and move on when you love someone. Every little thing will remind you of them, and the person will always be special to you.  This is a sign of deep attraction. 

Liking someone mainly involves being physically attracted to the person. It’s all about sexual intimacy and sexual love. 98% of the time, you guys hang out, leads to sex. Worse yet, the person hardly spends the night and is always eager to leave.

Being in your presence and spending quality time with love is enough. They make time for you regardless of how hectic their schedule is.  This is one of the main differences between liking and loving someone. 

When you like someone, the effort you put into making them happy is limited. Instead, they are your source of happiness. You don’t go out of your way to make them laugh; rather, you are happy to be the center of attraction.

When you love somebody, the spotlight shifts from you to them; you want to make them happy at the expense of yours. So you will aim to put a smile on their face regardless of the cost.

Your attraction to somebody you like is probably because you think they are perfect. You have built up this image of them that might not be real in your head. You aren’t curious to see what is under the surface.

With love, you understand that the person is human and therefore imperfect. You also end up loving the imperfect part of them. You will embrace their flaws and won’t force them to change.

You get nervous and self-conscious around the person. But, on the other hand, you’re eager to leave an impression, even a false one. So when the person you like enters the room, you adjust your outfit and recheck your appearance to ensure you’re perfect.

You don’t try to hide the real you from the person you love. You are an open book and won’t pretend to be someone you’re not. Likewise, if you’re around the person you love, you won’t try to hide your flaws from them.



You can feel an instant attraction for somebody you just met. You don’t know anything about the person, so your attraction isn’t based on their character or personality. Rather it is based on what you see. 

Falling in love with someone is not immediate but takes time. With love, you won’t be able to pinpoint when it started. A study reveals that men take at least 3 months to confess to their partner they love them, and women take about 5 months. 

You pretend to listen when the person you like talks. However, you are barely interested in what they have to say, and you feign interest not to offend the person. You could even be more focused on the person’s physical attributes than their words.

When the person you love speaks, you listen to every word. You’re interested in what they have to say because it gives you an insight into who they are.

You can’t go past feigning interest in their problems with somebody you like. Yes, you might wish them peace of mind, but you won’t go the extra mile to make this happen. After all, it’s their problem, not yours. 

The problems of somebody you love are yours. You’re ready to do everything possible to solve their problem and ensure they are free from any issues.

Your attraction to somebody you like is mainly physical and based on emotions. You might even walk away if problems arise in the relationship. However, it is comfortable staying with the person because everything is perfect, and as a couple, you’re yet to face difficulties. 

You choose to love someone in the bad and good times. You decide to care and stay with the person even when the relationship gets tough. The person’s flaws won’t send you running for the hills.

When you like someone, you want to show them off like a prize with the thought that they positively reflect on you. It’s about you and not them. If they are good-looking, you’re always eager to show them off to your friends.

When you love someone, you’re not interested in what they can do for you but vice versa. You are simply proud of them, irrespective of how they look or their achievements.

You wouldn’t want them to leave you, so you crave perfection. You are always trying to perfect yourself, even if that perfect person is a false depiction of who you are.

If you want to get the attention of someone you like, you will reveal half of yourself, the half that is always beautifully dressed, says and does the perfect things.

When you love somebody, you want to be worthy of them. They inspire you to grow and be the best version of yourself. The goal is not to change you but inspire you..



You easily get unimpressed and ready to end the relationship when you see their embarrassing side. You also get turned off when the whole charade of perfection has ended, and you get a glimpse into their real self.

If your attraction for them crashes in this instance, then there is a great chance you just liked them.

You don’t get turned off when you see the embarrassing side of the person; instead, you love them more. Your feelings for the person can’t fade just because you have a front seat to the person’s life, both the good and bad parts.

When you like a person, they are always on your mind and can even appear in your dreams. Unfortunately, you’re stuck in the past, how the person looked or how they dressed. You are not interested in what the future holds for the relationship. 

You not only constantly think about the person, but you also want the person to be part of your future. You are way past daydreaming about the person’s physical attributes and whatnot. The goal is to make the person part of your future 

Your feelings are portrayed obsessively. If you can offer the person you’re attracted to a magical potion to reciprocate the feelings, you will. Your feelings are on the surface level and composed of lust and attraction.

You are likely to make wrong decisions in their presence. 

You are rational and well-balanced when you’re with the person. In fact, with the person’s help, you make sound and wise decisions. 

You are reluctant to rock the boat and raise issues in the relationship. When somebody you like makes a mistake, you overlook or downplay their mistakes. You are more eager to please the person than let them grow into a better version of themselves.

Irrespective of the effects of your words, you won’t let a person you love continue making mistakes. Instead, you would rather invoke their wrath if that will help them improve. 

The more you get to know each other, the more your attraction fades. The excitement and thrill of the person start diminishing because they are not a mystery anymore. When you like someone, you’re interested in the façade they put up.

You fall harder when you know what makes the person you love tick. You will grow fond of them and will enjoy their presence.

You want to be pampered and cared for. However, you’re not eager to return the favor and might mumble or complain when asked to.

You’re excited to care for and indulge them when you love someone because love is selfless. It wouldn’t matter if your actions are not reciprocated; what matters is that there is a smile on the face of the person you love.



A simple fight and you’re out the door without looking back. You’re not prepared to settle or talk things out with the person you like. Your ego determines your response, and if it is bruised, you lose all incentive to stay. 

A series of fights cannot send you out the door. Losing the person you love is a scary thought, and as a result, you would want to work through the problem. Leaving is not even an option. 

You’re only attracted to the person you like, and being unable to see the person will affect that attraction. Your feelings for the person will likely face, and another person can easily replace them.

With love, the heart will grow fonder with time. Even if the person you love is thousands of miles away, your love won’t diminish; instead, you will long for the day you see them.

Meeting the family isn’t a big deal. You have one foot out of the relationship and the other in. The family’s feelings towards you won’t be a big deal.

You want to be accepted by the family because you want to be a part of it one day. So, putting your best foot forward when meeting the family is the only strategy you will apply.

It’s easy to get jealous if you see the person you like with another. This is because you tend to be possessive and controlling of the person you like.

When you love someone, you won’t seek to control them. Instead, you will treat them with respect as individuals and be available for them. What you’re interested in is their happiness.

Liking someone involves only emotional intimacy. Your feelings may even be shallow and only involve physical appearance. If the person changes their look, your feelings will also change.

When you love someone, it transcends surface feelings and looks. You are past fantasy or being enchanted by just their looks. Now, you’re enchanted with every part of them.

When you like someone, your feelings are based on many factors, such as physical appearance. Your feelings fade when those factors change.

When you love someone, it doesn’t come with terms and conditions. It is without strings, and it is offered freely. Little disagreements won’t make you walk away from them.

You’re more likely to forget anniversaries and birthdays when the relationship is new, and you like someone. You might not even be interested in celebrating little milestones.

Whether it is anniversaries, birthdays, or the first time you kissed your love, you are eager to mark a milestone. Those moments are special to you, and you want to celebrate with them. 

There is a like vs. love controversy, and it is hard to know where you stand if you aren’t aware of the difference between both terms.

The characteristics of likeness vary, and it doesn’t mean your feelings for the person aren’t genuine. However, when you love someone, your affections are profound and earnest.

Despite their frequent interchangeability, the terms “love” and “like” have rather distinct meanings and emotions. The difference between liking and loving someone goes beyond simple language and explores the complex worlds of intimacy, connection, and human emotions. In order to identify these differences, one must make their way through the maze of emotions and encounters that characterize these unique loves.

Liking someone is about having feelings of admiration, enjoyment, and appreciation. It is the spark that starts friendships, encourages teamwork, and serves as the cornerstone of a lot of partnerships. To like someone is to be happy in their company, to take pleasure in common interests, and to feel at ease with them. Although it’s a pleasant emotion, it frequently lacks the profundity and ardor of love.

Contrarily, love is more than just fondness; it is a deep and lasting bond. Love is a complex fabric made of compassion, understanding, respect, and unshakable dedication. A combination of feelings, including both the difficult lows and the exhilarating highs, is what connects two souls.

Author Leo Buscaglia aptly encapsulates this contrast, saying, “To love is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully around hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, and airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, and irredeemable.” Let’s examine a story that highlights the turbulence and complexity frequently connected to sentiments of attachment to better understand the differences between these two emotions.

Consider Sana, a young professional employed in a busy town. Her life was all about deadlines and strict timetables until that fateful day when she met Alex, a coworker whose contagious laugh and sincere friendliness left a lasting impression on her.

Weeks passed, and Sana could no longer resist Alex’s company. She found comfort in their company, laughed with them, and loved their chats. She began to notice gradually that her affection for Alex was developing into something more. It was more than a desire to spend time together and enjoy themselves; it was a need to know what Alex was thinking, feeling, and dreaming. It was a desire for a relationship that went deeper than that.

Sana struggled to understand her feelings and whether they were just a simple fondness or whether they had crossed over into love. She came to the realization that although she loved Alex’s company and appreciated many aspects of him, it didn’t fully capture the deep, unselfish commitment and profundity that define love. It instead captured the happiness of having a strong affection for someone without going over the line into love.

The story of Sana’s infatuation serves as an example of the important but subtle distinctions between liking and loving someone. It draws attention to the subtle differences between these feelings, highlighting the fact that although they are both significant and lovely in and of themselves, they exist on distinct emotional planes.

Essentially, the difference between liking and loving someone is based on their level of commitment, understanding, and vulnerability, in addition to the strength of their feelings. Emotions enhance the human experience by providing levels of complexity and significance to our interactions, whether it is the intense attachment of love or the exhilaration of someone.

也许很多人无法分辨喜欢和爱，觉得这两个词的含义是大同小异，如果你这样想就错了。喜欢只是对一个人或者某样事物的心动，就是有情感上的触动和感觉；爱则是对一个人或者某样事物发自内心的喜欢，是一种刻骨铭心的喜欢，可以为了对方甘愿付出自己的所有，只是为了博得红颜一笑。

喜欢一个人和爱一个人在本质上，是有很大的区别的。当你看到莫个人产生好感，喜欢上了她，你会不由自主做出亲近她的行为举止。你愿意去接近她，了解她，但是一旦发生什么事情的时候，你可以随时抽身离开，并不会引起你内心多大的触动，顶多就是难过一阵子。爱一个人，你就会想时时刻刻和她在一起。无论是在你工作忙碌的时候，还是在你有空余闲暇时间的时候，一想到她，你的内心就会一片柔软。即使你是一个钢铁五尺男儿，你的心也会柔软地一塌糊涂，整个胸腔都被她占据了，她就是你心中的女神！



喜欢和爱有什么区别？通常通过以下三种表现，你就可以判断你们两个人之间的感情属于哪一种？

1、喜欢只是心动，爱则是行动

每个人一生当中，可以遇到很多自己喜欢的人或者事物。比如你看到花园里一朵娇艳欲滴含苞怒放的玫瑰花，因为喜欢，你忍不住动手把它摘了下来。带回家以后，把它插在花瓶里，欣赏了几天以后，花枯萎了，你随手就把它丢弃了。而另一个真正爱这朵玫瑰花的人，因为他发自内心的喜欢这朵玫瑰花，也就是说喜欢的程度不一样，是一个真正爱花的人。他不愿意也不舍得去摘下这朵玫瑰花，他每天用心拿水去浇灌这朵玫瑰花，尽可能地延长这朵玫瑰花的生命和花期，让它的美丽可以绽放地更加长久。

就像一个女孩子她同时遇到了两个追求者，她觉得他们两个人都很好，不知道如何选择。一个每天都会早安晚安问候不断，感觉他是一个对感情很认真，而且也愿意投入感情的人；另一个追求者则是一个不善言辞，为人比较木讷内向的人。他平时很少说什么甜蜜的话语，但是只要有事情，他就会第一时间来到女孩的身边，帮她解决问题和困难。有一次女孩子感冒生病了，没有去公司上班。那个每天早晚问候的男生知道她生病了，立刻殷勤地打电话发信息过来，让女生多休息多喝水，然后就没有下文了。而那个木讷的男孩子知道她生病了没有上班，立刻下班后就去买了感冒药，连夜赶去女孩家，督促她把感冒药喝了。女孩最终选择了这个用行动来表达爱的男生，因为这才是真正的爱，愿意为对方付出，即使辛劳而不求回报。



2、喜欢是一时的感觉，爱则是一生的拥有

我们会在某一个特定的时刻，喜欢上某一个人或者事物，一旦脱离开那个环境，我们很快就会把这段感情忘却。例如很多人说旅行容易发生艳遇，容易找到爱情，但是也有可能只是一次爱情的快餐。一个人外出旅行，特别是对于单身的男女，如果你是一个思想相对Openging的人，确实很容易发生艳遇。因为人是属于群居动物，当他长期在一个人孤单寂寞的生活状态下，恰巧遇到了一个谈得来有感觉的人，两个人可能很快就产生了感情。但是这种感情来的快去的也快，随着旅程的结束，两个人很快回归到现实生活中，就会去权衡利弊这段感情的得与失。

喜欢一个人，你可以随时放手：爱一个人，你却希望这辈子永远牵住她的手，不离不弃。喜欢只是一时的心动，爱则是爱到骨子里，不愿放弃只想拥有她的感情。就像小孩子喜欢玩玩具一样，他可以今天玩积木，明天玩挖土机，随时可以更换，只要有玩具玩就可以了。爱一个人，则是把自己的感情全部托付出去，希望能够让对方幸福，希望得到对方的回应，希望可以一辈子拥有她，这辈子都不愿意分开。余生只想执子之手与子偕老，和你在一起的日子，就是最好的日子。我的人生因为遇到了你，才充满了爱的光芒幸福的光辉。

3、喜欢是可以替代的，爱则是全身心的投入

喜欢只是感情的其中一种表达方式，就是爱的深度不一样。就像很多人喜欢追星，他们可能今天喜欢这个明星，明天又喜欢另一个明星，就是感情很容易转变。但是大家对自己身边的爱人却不一样，因为她是自己的终身伴侣，所以感情可以长期持久稳定的维持下去。当然随着时间的流逝，可能感情会慢慢就过渡成了左手握右手的样子。爱情变成了亲情，彼此对对方的爱早已渗入进了彼此的身心，都已成为对方生命中的一部分。

爱人这个词是很神圣的，不要轻易谈爱，谈了就不要轻易分开。就像父爱，母爱，爱情，都是彼此渗透进了对方的生活里或生命中，是双方不可缺少的一部分。彼此之间都有对对方感情的依赖，愿意把自己所拥有的东西提供给对方，无论是金钱还是感情。只要看到对方欢快愉悦的笑脸，自己就满心欢喜非常满足。

一个走肾一个走心，喜欢是有底线的。出于客观或者主观原因，，你会主动放弃她。但是爱不同，你会为了她一次次放弃自己的底线。喜欢是索取和占有，而爱却是付出与长久。

如果在你的生命里，遇到了一个爱你宠你到骨子里的人，他愿意把自己所拥有的一切都给你。往后余生他只想和你一起走，一起经历人生的风风雨雨，无论是苦还是甜，他都愿意和你一起分享。也许他不会对你说什么甜言蜜语，但是无论他身在何处，他总是牵挂着你，他对你所有的爱都是用行动实实在在的表现出来。如果你遇到了一个这样对你的人，你就好好珍惜吧！不要再瞻前顾后了，往后或许再也遇不到比他更好的了。

# 怎么判断喜欢和爱的区别_感情_对方_爱情


                        由内容质量、互动评论、分享传播等多维度分值决定，勋章级别越高(
                        
                        )，代表其在平台内的综合表现越好。
                    

怎么判断喜欢和爱的区别

印象中每次恋爱，说喜欢总会脱口而出，说爱似乎次数少之又少。我们很少会去特别认真的权衡两者的区别，却也会在日常中本能的分开。

我想，一份感情起初是喜欢，能长久在一起才是爱。喜欢是刹那瞬间的感觉，爱一定是经历时间的沉淀。而那种一开始就说爱不爱的，真的没必要太在意。



好的感情或许没必要去纠结是喜欢还是爱，两个人多点理解，多点包容，一起把心动的喜欢变成心安的爱，那或许就是最好的恋爱吧。

喜欢一个人很容易，努力爱一个人却很难。度过热恋期，就更应该让爱情变成亲情，让吸引变成彼此的依赖。按部就班于生活里的平平淡淡，也要努力让生活和感情有仪式感，有归属感。新鲜感永远都会存在，可责任感更应该束缚我们敬畏缘分，敬畏爱情。

这要看你想在这段感情里付出，还是想在这段感情里索取。

在一段两个人的恋情当中，真正的爱情是想为了那个人付出，想用自己的付出让对方幸福，在付出的同时得到对方的反馈，这才是幸福。

如果仅仅是欲望，那你在感情中就只想索取，哪怕对方已经付出了一切，你还是会觉得不够。

爱情是真诚的付出与回馈，是真心的希望对方能幸福。在一段感情生活当中，如果你真的喜欢一个人，你会特别在乎他的主观感受。

她的一颦一笑、一举一动，都会在你心里引起很大的反响。你害怕对方不开心，你害怕对方不快乐，你害怕你的付出不足够让对方幸福，你更害怕就这样失去对方。

内心的这种患得患失会让人付出的更频繁，付出的更多一些。我们是真的希望另一半能幸福，哪怕在时光中与我走散，也希望他能继续幸福下去。



怎么判断喜欢和爱？

喜欢一朵花，会摘下来，插在瓶里，枯萎了就丢掉，去摘下一朵。

爱一朵花，想好好呵护，除虫浇水，阳光雨露，盼它开的持久，即使谢了也能重开。

二十四节气

是中国人独有的浪漫与诗意

在天地万物的细节里

它们记录了光阴的故事

山川花鸟的万物情长

让在山南旅游的你

能清晰地感知到

在山南的四季中

雨水泛起的氤氲、花开的暗香盈盈

雪花纷飞的情意浓浓...... 

感受日月星辰的魅力

# 男人喜欢一个人，和爱一个人的区别_手机搜狐网

你分析得非常到位，确实在爱情中，男人对一个人的喜欢和爱是有着本质区别的。

喜欢往往是一时的冲动和表面的吸引，它可能源自于对方的外貌、性格或者某个瞬间的共鸣。这种喜欢可能会因为时间、距离或者新的吸引点的出现而逐渐消散。



而爱则是深入内心的情感，它基于更深的了解和共鸣。当一个男人真正爱上一个女人时，他会愿意为她付出一切，包括时间、精力甚至牺牲自己的利益。他会把对方放在心中最重要的位置，关心她的喜怒哀乐，愿意与她共度一生。



在爱情中，区分喜欢和爱是非常重要的。喜欢可能只是短暂的欢愉，而爱则是长久的陪伴和承诺。因此，对于女性来说，要理智地看待男人对自己的感情，不要轻易被一时的喜欢所迷惑，而要学会识别真正的爱情。



同时，也要珍惜那些真正爱自己的人，因为他们愿意与你共度人生的风雨，共同创造美好的未来。

也许很多人无法分辨喜欢和爱，觉得这两个词的含义是大同小异，如果你这样想就错了。喜欢只是对一个人或者某样事物的心动，就是有情感上的触动和感觉；爱则是对一个人或者某样事物发自内心的喜欢，是一种刻骨铭心的喜欢，可以为了对方甘愿付出自己的所有，只是为了博得红颜一笑。

喜欢一个人和爱一个人在本质上，是有很大的区别的。当你看到莫个人产生好感，喜欢上了她，你会不由自主做出亲近她的行为举止。你愿意去接近她，了解她，但是一旦发生什么事情的时候，你可以随时抽身离开，并不会引起你内心多大的触动，顶多就是难过一阵子。爱一个人，你就会想时时刻刻和她在一起。无论是在你工作忙碌的时候，还是在你有空余闲暇时间的时候，一想到她，你的内心就会一片柔软。即使你是一个钢铁五尺男儿，你的心也会柔软地一塌糊涂，整个胸腔都被她占据了，她就是你心中的女神！



喜欢和爱有什么区别？通常通过以下三种表现，你就可以判断你们两个人之间的感情属于哪一种？

1、喜欢只是心动，爱则是行动

每个人一生当中，可以遇到很多自己喜欢的人或者事物。比如你看到花园里一朵娇艳欲滴含苞怒放的玫瑰花，因为喜欢，你忍不住动手把它摘了下来。带回家以后，把它插在花瓶里，欣赏了几天以后，花枯萎了，你随手就把它丢弃了。而另一个真正爱这朵玫瑰花的人，因为他发自内心的喜欢这朵玫瑰花，也就是说喜欢的程度不一样，是一个真正爱花的人。他不愿意也不舍得去摘下这朵玫瑰花，他每天用心拿水去浇灌这朵玫瑰花，尽可能地延长这朵玫瑰花的生命和花期，让它的美丽可以绽放地更加长久。

就像一个女孩子她同时遇到了两个追求者，她觉得他们两个人都很好，不知道如何选择。一个每天都会早安晚安问候不断，感觉他是一个对感情很认真，而且也愿意投入感情的人；另一个追求者则是一个不善言辞，为人比较木讷内向的人。他平时很少说什么甜蜜的话语，但是只要有事情，他就会第一时间来到女孩的身边，帮她解决问题和困难。有一次女孩子感冒生病了，没有去公司上班。那个每天早晚问候的男生知道她生病了，立刻殷勤地打电话发信息过来，让女生多休息多喝水，然后就没有下文了。而那个木讷的男孩子知道她生病了没有上班，立刻下班后就去买了感冒药，连夜赶去女孩家，督促她把感冒药喝了。女孩最终选择了这个用行动来表达爱的男生，因为这才是真正的爱，愿意为对方付出，即使辛劳而不求回报。



2、喜欢是一时的感觉，爱则是一生的拥有

我们会在某一个特定的时刻，喜欢上某一个人或者事物，一旦脱离开那个环境，我们很快就会把这段感情忘却。例如很多人说旅行容易发生艳遇，容易找到爱情，但是也有可能只是一次爱情的快餐。一个人外出旅行，特别是对于单身的男女，如果你是一个思想相对Openging的人，确实很容易发生艳遇。因为人是属于群居动物，当他长期在一个人孤单寂寞的生活状态下，恰巧遇到了一个谈得来有感觉的人，两个人可能很快就产生了感情。但是这种感情来的快去的也快，随着旅程的结束，两个人很快回归到现实生活中，就会去权衡利弊这段感情的得与失。

喜欢一个人，你可以随时放手：爱一个人，你却希望这辈子永远牵住她的手，不离不弃。喜欢只是一时的心动，爱则是爱到骨子里，不愿放弃只想拥有她的感情。就像小孩子喜欢玩玩具一样，他可以今天玩积木，明天玩挖土机，随时可以更换，只要有玩具玩就可以了。爱一个人，则是把自己的感情全部托付出去，希望能够让对方幸福，希望得到对方的回应，希望可以一辈子拥有她，这辈子都不愿意分开。余生只想执子之手与子偕老，和你在一起的日子，就是最好的日子。我的人生因为遇到了你，才充满了爱的光芒幸福的光辉。

3、喜欢是可以替代的，爱则是全身心的投入

喜欢只是感情的其中一种表达方式，就是爱的深度不一样。就像很多人喜欢追星，他们可能今天喜欢这个明星，明天又喜欢另一个明星，就是感情很容易转变。但是大家对自己身边的爱人却不一样，因为她是自己的终身伴侣，所以感情可以长期持久稳定的维持下去。当然随着时间的流逝，可能感情会慢慢就过渡成了左手握右手的样子。爱情变成了亲情，彼此对对方的爱早已渗入进了彼此的身心，都已成为对方生命中的一部分。

爱人这个词是很神圣的，不要轻易谈爱，谈了就不要轻易分开。就像父爱，母爱，爱情，都是彼此渗透进了对方的生活里或生命中，是双方不可缺少的一部分。彼此之间都有对对方感情的依赖，愿意把自己所拥有的东西提供给对方，无论是金钱还是感情。只要看到对方欢快愉悦的笑脸，自己就满心欢喜非常满足。

一个走肾一个走心，喜欢是有底线的。出于客观或者主观原因，，你会主动放弃她。但是爱不同，你会为了她一次次放弃自己的底线。喜欢是索取和占有，而爱却是付出与长久。

如果在你的生命里，遇到了一个爱你宠你到骨子里的人，他愿意把自己所拥有的一切都给你。往后余生他只想和你一起走，一起经历人生的风风雨雨，无论是苦还是甜，他都愿意和你一起分享。也许他不会对你说什么甜言蜜语，但是无论他身在何处，他总是牵挂着你，他对你所有的爱都是用行动实实在在的表现出来。如果你遇到了一个这样对你的人，你就好好珍惜吧！不要再瞻前顾后了，往后或许再也遇不到比他更好的了。

怎么判断喜欢和爱的区别

印象中每次恋爱，说喜欢总会脱口而出，说爱似乎次数少之又少。我们很少会去特别认真的权衡两者的区别，却也会在日常中本能的分开。

我想，一份感情起初是喜欢，能长久在一起才是爱。喜欢是刹那瞬间的感觉，爱一定是经历时间的沉淀。而那种一开始就说爱不爱的，真的没必要太在意。



好的感情或许没必要去纠结是喜欢还是爱，两个人多点理解，多点包容，一起把心动的喜欢变成心安的爱，那或许就是最好的恋爱吧。

喜欢一个人很容易，努力爱一个人却很难。度过热恋期，就更应该让爱情变成亲情，让吸引变成彼此的依赖。按部就班于生活里的平平淡淡，也要努力让生活和感情有仪式感，有归属感。新鲜感永远都会存在，可责任感更应该束缚我们敬畏缘分，敬畏爱情。

这要看你想在这段感情里付出，还是想在这段感情里索取。

在一段两个人的恋情当中，真正的爱情是想为了那个人付出，想用自己的付出让对方幸福，在付出的同时得到对方的反馈，这才是幸福。

如果仅仅是欲望，那你在感情中就只想索取，哪怕对方已经付出了一切，你还是会觉得不够。

爱情是真诚的付出与回馈，是真心的希望对方能幸福。在一段感情生活当中，如果你真的喜欢一个人，你会特别在乎他的主观感受。

她的一颦一笑、一举一动，都会在你心里引起很大的反响。你害怕对方不开心，你害怕对方不快乐，你害怕你的付出不足够让对方幸福，你更害怕就这样失去对方。

内心的这种患得患失会让人付出的更频繁，付出的更多一些。我们是真的希望另一半能幸福，哪怕在时光中与我走散，也希望他能继续幸福下去。



怎么判断喜欢和爱？

喜欢一朵花，会摘下来，插在瓶里，枯萎了就丢掉，去摘下一朵。

爱一朵花，想好好呵护，除虫浇水，阳光雨露，盼它开的持久，即使谢了也能重开。

二十四节气

是中国人独有的浪漫与诗意

在天地万物的细节里

它们记录了光阴的故事

山川花鸟的万物情长

让在山南旅游的你

能清晰地感知到

在山南的四季中

雨水泛起的氤氲、花开的暗香盈盈

雪花纷飞的情意浓浓...... 

感受日月星辰的魅力

# 男人喜欢一个人，和爱一个人的区别_手机搜狐网

你分析得非常到位，确实在爱情中，男人对一个人的喜欢和爱是有着本质区别的。

喜欢往往是一时的冲动和表面的吸引，它可能源自于对方的外貌、性格或者某个瞬间的共鸣。这种喜欢可能会因为时间、距离或者新的吸引点的出现而逐渐消散。



而爱则是深入内心的情感，它基于更深的了解和共鸣。当一个男人真正爱上一个女人时，他会愿意为她付出一切，包括时间、精力甚至牺牲自己的利益。他会把对方放在心中最重要的位置，关心她的喜怒哀乐，愿意与她共度一生。



在爱情中，区分喜欢和爱是非常重要的。喜欢可能只是短暂的欢愉，而爱则是长久的陪伴和承诺。因此，对于女性来说，要理智地看待男人对自己的感情，不要轻易被一时的喜欢所迷惑，而要学会识别真正的爱情。



同时，也要珍惜那些真正爱自己的人，因为他们愿意与你共度人生的风雨，共同创造美好的未来。

# 聊斋志异 - 维基百科，自由的百科全书

《聊斋志异》，简称《聊斋》，又称《鬼狐传》，是清康熙年间蒲松龄所著的奇闻轶事小说。 全书共491篇，内容十分广泛，多谈狐仙、鬼、妖，反映了18世纪中国的社会面貌。 作者也在这本书深刻地描写了狐仙、鬼和妖，而字里行间也透露出鬼比人还要有情义，以此讽刺当时的时代。


蒲松龄出生于书香世家，他早年也曾想借助科举入仕，可惜屡试不第，只能以教书为生。他自幼便对民间的鬼神故事兴致浓厚。据说，蒲松龄曾为了搜集素材，在家门口开了一家茶馆，来喝茶的人可以用一个故事代替茶钱。借助这个方法，蒲松龄搜集了大量离奇的故事，经过整理、加工后，他都将其收录到了《聊斋志异》中。


《聊斋》一书四百多篇短篇小说中，有刺贪刺虐的，有描写花妖狐魅和鬼、妖、仙女等的爱情故事的，这些故事像是作者自主创作以借此来表达对社会的不满和对爱情的向往，然而也有一些故事仅仅是情节怪异而已；其情节单一，甚至只有短短十馀字，这些故事不像是作者创作的而像是百姓之间的传说。


《聊斋志异》多写人与花妖狐魅的恋爱故事，如“青凤”、“莲香”、“小玉”、“婴宁”和“丫鬟”等。《聊斋志异》也批评科举制度的腐败，如“考弊司”、“王之安”、“司文郎”、“三生”等；并揭露政治和社会的黑暗，如“席方平”、“依织”、“红玉”、“窦氏”、“续黄梁”等。


《聊斋志异》尚有其他题材，如“劳山道士”写好逸恶劳；“黄九郎”写断袖之癖也；“娇娜”写朋友之义矣；“张诚”写兄弟之爱；“阿绣”写男女互恋之爱；“堪舆”写风水迷信；“仇大娘”写仗义行为；“田七郎”写猎人侠义；“促织”写斗蟋蟀的悲喜剧；“罗刹海市”写海上奇遇记；“偷桃”“口技”写民间艺人的绝技。“公孙九娘”写清初镇压起义军的惨烈，“于七一案，连坐被诛者，栖霞、莱阳两县最多。一日俘数百人，尽戮于演武场中，碧血满地，白骨撑天。上官慈悲，捐给棺木，济城工肆，材木一空。以故伏刑东鬼，多葬南郊。”，堪为史笔。


情节上，《聊斋志异》的故事情节曲折；人物方面，善于塑造人物，通过写景烘托人物；语言方面，善于提炼语言；风格方面，寓浪漫主义色彩。


对于人物及人与人的关系刻画的十分清楚，将人的复杂性道出，引导读者反思道德观念。


笔法及内容上，兼具魏晋志怪及唐代传奇之特色。


总体来说，阅读《聊斋志异》能加深对中国古典文学的理解，能感受古代的社会风貌，能思考人性与道德议题，对妖、神、仙、精等再更加一层的理解。


蒲松龄同乡好友王士祯则为《聊斋志异》题诗：“姑妄言之姑听之，豆棚瓜架雨如丝。料应厌作人间语，爱听秋坟鬼唱诗。”士祯对《聊斋志异》甚为喜爱，给予极高评价，所谓“数奇其才，谓非寻常流辈所及也。”[1]，并为其作评点，甚至欲以五百两黄金购《聊斋志异》之手稿而不可得。乾隆年间，余集在整理《聊斋志异》刊刻写序，指出这部作品在“恍惚幻妄，光怪陆离”之中“托志幽遐”，有“微旨所存”。


纪晓岚：“留仙之才，余诚莫逮其万一。”/但纪晓岚也批判聊斋“一书兼二体”。[2]


冯镇峦于嘉庆二十三年（1818年）评点《聊斋》，并称“当代小说家言，定以此书第一”[3]。“聊斋非独文笔之佳，独有千古，第一议论醇正，准情酌理，毫无可驳。如名儒讲学，如老僧谈禅，如乡曲长者读诵劝世文，观之实有益于身心，警戒顽愚。至说到忠孝节义，令人雪涕，令人猛醒，更为有关世教之书。”陈廷机《聊斋志异》序：“亦以空前绝后之作，使唐人见之，自当把臂入林，后来作者，宜其搁笔耳。”


鲁迅评论《聊斋志异》：“《聊斋志异》虽亦如当时同类之书，不外记神仙狐鬼精魅故事，然描写委曲，叙次井然，用传奇法，而以志怪。变幻之状，如在目前；又或易调该弦，别叙崎人异行，出于幻灭，顿入人间；偶叙琐闻，亦多简洁，故读者耳目，为之一新。……明末志怪群书，大抵简略，又多荒诞不情；《聊斋志异》独于详尽之处，示以平常，使花妖狐魅，多是人情，和易可亲，忘为异类，而又偶见鹘突，知复非人。”[4]


郭沫若：“写鬼写妖高人一等，刺贪刺虐入骨三分。”


1、稿本系统（即作者亲手写的本子）：作者去世后五十余年中，子孙因家贫也无力将手稿刊行流传。在很长一段时间内，《聊斋志异》手稿同蒲氏其他一些手稿（文集四卷、诗集六卷、杂著五种、戏曲三出、俚曲十四种）一直深扃严藏于淄川城内玉英街蒲氏家祠。咸丰年间，蒲氏七世孙蒲价人在山东淄川老家于家族间因子女过嗣，引起了纠纷， 携家远走东北，辽宁省图书馆珍藏至今。2012年，辽宁省图书馆商上海古籍出版社，将馆藏蒲松龄《聊斋志异》半部手稿用高仿技术影印出版。

# 聊齋志異 - 维基百科，自由的百科全书

《聊齋志異》，簡稱《聊齋》，又稱《鬼狐傳》，是清康熙年間蒲松齡所著的奇聞軼事小說。 全書共491篇，内容十分廣泛，多談狐仙、鬼、妖，反映了18世纪中國的社會面貌。 作者也在這本書深刻地描寫了狐仙、鬼和妖，而字裡行間也透露出鬼比人還要有情義，以此諷刺當時的時代。


蒲松齡出生於書香世家，他早年也曾想借助科舉入仕，可惜屢試不第，只能以教書為生。他自幼便對民間的鬼神故事興致濃厚。據説，蒲松齡曾為了蒐集素材，在家門口開了一家茶館，來喝茶的人可以用一個故事代替茶錢。藉助這個方法，蒲松齡蒐集了大量離奇的故事，經過整理、加工後，他都將其收錄到了《聊齋志異》中。


《聊齋》一書四百多篇短篇小說中，有刺貪刺虐的，有描寫花妖狐魅和鬼、妖、仙女等的愛情故事的，這些故事像是作者自主創作以藉此來表達對社會的不滿和對愛情的嚮往，然而也有一些故事僅僅是情節怪異而已；其情節單一，甚至只有短短十餘字，這些故事不像是作者創作的而像是百姓之間的傳說。


《聊齋誌異》多寫人與花妖狐魅的戀愛故事，如「青鳳」、「蓮香」、「小玉」、「嬰寧」和「丫鬟」等。《聊齋誌異》也批評科舉制度的腐敗，如「考弊司」、「王之安」、「司文郎」、「三生」等；並揭露政治和社會的黑暗，如「席方平」、「依織」、「紅玉」、「竇氏」、「續黃梁」等。


《聊齋誌異》尚有其他題材，如「勞山道士」寫好逸惡勞；「黃九郎」寫斷袖之癖也；「嬌娜」寫朋友之義矣；「張誠」寫兄弟之愛；「阿繡」寫男女互戀之愛；「堪輿」寫風水迷信；「仇大娘」寫仗義行為；「田七郎」寫獵人俠義；「促織」寫鬥蟋蟀的悲喜劇；「罗刹海市」寫海上奇遇記；「偷桃」「口技」寫民間藝人的絕技。「公孫九娘」寫清初鎮壓起義軍的慘烈，“于七一案，連坐被誅者，棲霞、萊陽兩縣最多。一日俘數百人，盡戮于演武場中，碧血滿地，白骨撐天。上官慈悲，捐給棺木，濟城工肆，材木一空。以故伏刑東鬼，多葬南郊。”，堪為史筆。


情節上，《聊齋誌異》的故事情節曲折；人物方面，善於塑造人物，通過寫景烘托人物；語言方面，善於提煉語言；風格方面，寓浪漫主義色彩。


對於人物及人與人的關係刻畫的十分清楚，將人的複雜性道出，引導讀者反思道德觀念。


筆法及內容上，兼具魏晉志怪及唐代傳奇之特色。


總體來說，閱讀《聊齋誌異》能加深對中國古典文學的理解，能感受古代的社會風貌，能思考人性與道德議題，對妖、神、仙、精等再更加一層的理解。


蒲松龄同鄉好友王士禎則為《聊齋誌異》題詩：“姑妄言之姑聽之，豆棚瓜架雨如絲。料應厭作人間語，愛聽秋墳鬼唱詩。”士禎對《聊齋誌異》甚為喜愛，給予極高評價，所谓“数奇其才，谓非寻常流辈所及也。”[1]，並為其作評點，甚至欲以五百兩黃金購《聊齋誌異》之手稿而不可得。乾隆年間，余集在整理《聊斋誌异》刊刻写序，指出这部作品在“恍惚幻妄，光怪陆离”之中“托志幽遐”，有“微旨所存”。


紀曉嵐：“留仙之才，余诚莫逮其万一。”/但紀曉嵐也批判聊齋“一書兼二體”。[2]


冯镇峦于嘉庆二十三年（1818年）评点《聊斋》，並稱“当代小说家言，定以此书第一”[3]。“聊齋非獨文筆之佳，獨有千古，第一議論醇正，準情酌理，毫無可駁。如名儒講學，如老僧談禪，如鄉曲長者讀誦勸世文，觀之實有益於身心，警戒頑愚。至說到忠孝節義，令人雪涕，令人猛醒，更為有關世教之書。”陳廷機《聊齋志異》序：“亦以空前絕後之作，使唐人見之，自當把臂入林，後來作者，宜其擱筆耳。”


魯迅評論《聊齋誌異》：“《聊斋志异》虽亦如当时同类之书，不外记神仙狐鬼精魅故事，然描寫委曲，敘次井然，用傳奇法，而以志怪。變幻之狀，如在目前；又或易调该弦，别叙崎人异行，出于幻灭，顿入人间；偶叙琐闻，亦多简洁，故读者耳目，为之一新。……明末志怪群書，大抵簡略，又多荒誕不情；《聊齋誌異》獨於詳盡之處，示以平常，使花妖狐魅，多是人情，和易可親，忘為異類，而又偶見鶻突，知復非人。”[4]


郭沫若：「寫鬼寫妖高人一等，刺貪刺虐入骨三分。」


1、稿本系統（即作者親手寫的本子）：作者去世后五十余年中，子孙因家贫也无力将手稿刊行流传。在很长一段时间内，《聊斋志异》手稿同蒲氏其他一些手稿（文集四卷、诗集六卷、杂著五种、戏曲三出、俚曲十四种）一直深扃严藏于淄川城内玉英街蒲氏家祠。咸丰年间，蒲氏七世孙蒲价人在山东淄川老家于家族间因子女过嗣，引起了纠纷， 携家远走东北，辽宁省图书馆珍藏至今。2012年，辽宁省图书馆商上海古籍出版社，将馆藏蒲松龄《聊斋志异》半部手稿用高仿技术影印出版。


2、抄本系統（即作者以外的人所傳抄的本子）：《聊斋志异》完成于清康熙十九年（1680年）；在蒲松龄生前及去世五十年内多以抄本流传


3、刊本系統（即正式發行出版的本子）：

# 蒲松龄文章理解，参考赏析-古诗文网

　　“异史氏曰”的一段文字是蒲松龄对故事所作的评论，这也是笔记小说常用的一种形式，通过评语直接表达自己的观点。这段评论主要有三点：

　　第一，从官贪吏虐追溯到天子宫廷，指出“天子一跬步，皆关民命，不可忽也”，寄讽谏之旨；

　　第二，就成名的一贫一富说明是“天将酬长厚者”，反映了“善恶有报”的宿命论思想；

　　第三，针对抚臣、令尹蒙受促织“恩荫”，证实“一人飞升，仙及鸡犬”的说法，生动地表明封建官僚的升迁发迹是建立在百姓苦难之上的，在此作者抒发了愤懑不平之感。

　　蒲松龄作《聊斋志异》，古书有载：“相传先生居乡里，落拓无偶，性尤怪僻，为村中童子师，食贫自给，不求于人。作此书时，每临晨携大磁罂，中贮苦茗，具淡巴菰一包，置行人大道旁。下陈芦衬，坐于上，烟茗置身畔，见行道者过，必强执与语，搜奇说异，随人所知；渴则饮以茗，或奉以烟。必令畅谈乃已。偶闻一事，归而粉饰。如是二十余寒暑，此书方告蒇。故笔法超绝。”《聊斋志异》全书十二卷，四百八十八篇，通过花妖鬼怪故事，人神鬼相杂、幽明相间的艺术画面，揭露封建社会的黑暗和官场的罪恶，讽刺科举制的腐朽和弊端，歌颂男女青年的纯真爱情，批判了不合理的婚姻制度。作品继承和发扬了六朝志怪小说和唐传奇小说的艺术传统，既具有浓厚的浪漫主义色彩，又给人以现实主义的真实感。构思奇特，幻异曲折，跌宕多变，刻画细腻，文笔洗练。其思想和艺术成就，标志着中国文言短篇小说创作达到一个新的高峰，在中国文学史上占有很高地位。

　　高中语文课本所选的《促织》，是《聊斋志异》中的优秀篇章，主题思想和艺术成就均达到很高的水平，可谓是文学精品。本文拟从情节、语言、人物三方面赏析其艺术魅力。

　　一、情节曲折，构思严谨中国小说起源于古代的神话传说，因此形成的艺术传统是，非常注重故事的情节，善于营造跌宕起伏的曲折性和起承转合的完整性。《促织》一文以“促织”为线索，叙述清晰，又曲折动人。它的情节可以概括如下：征虫－－觅虫－－求虫－－得虫－－失虫－－化虫－－斗虫－－献虫。其中“征虫－觅虫”可看成是故事的开端，“求虫－得虫”是故事的发展，“失虫－化虫－斗虫”是故事的高潮，“献虫”是故事的结局。这样，全文的情节特征已经一目了然。但本文的曲折性还体现在每一个发展过程：成名初次觅虫不得，转侧床头，唯思自尽，走到了山穷水尽，是为一波；而巫婆的适时出现，让成名能按图索骥，于村东大佛阁后得虫，可谓是柳暗花明，又为一波；刚刚得虫，举家庆贺，不料半路杀出个程咬金，成子好奇，“窃发盆”，虫得而复失，再起一波；成名归，“怒索儿”，却不料儿子也已跳井自尽，人物两空，祸不单行，是为推波助澜；其后，成子竟然“半夜复苏”，又身化促织，虽令人匪夷所思，但文章也就从此得以急转直下，豁然开朗；此后，小说极力地以其貌不扬，来反衬促织的轻捷善斗，突出其奇异功能，斗虫，斗鸡，无不胜，又能“闻琴瑟之声，则应节而舞”，也写得波澜起伏，扣人心弦；最后以大团圆结局，让人于紧张之后，可以长舒一口气，但淡然一笑后，不由得要掩卷三思…… 故事情节曲折，却构思严谨。纵观全文，起承转合，前呼后应，结构完整。关于起承转合，上面已经叙述过了。至于前呼后应，至少有两处照应非常好，一是故事起因于“宣德间，宫中尚促织之戏，岁征民间”，以“上大嘉悦，诏赐抚臣名马衣缎……”为终，应了“解铃还需系铃人”的古话；二是成名始“操童子业，久不售，为人迂讷”，且家中“薄产累尽”，而终能“入邑庠”，且“田万顷，楼阁万椽，牛羊蹄跷各千计；一出门，裘马过世家焉”，可谓善有善报。

　　二、语言精炼，生动形象《聊斋志异》一书历数十年乃成，且不断修改增补，其语言来自民间，又经艺术加工，自然十分的精炼、生动。用词精炼主要表现在对动词的运用，十分恰当，而且经济。如第三段：“成妻纳钱案上，焚拜如前人。食顷，帘动，片纸抛落。拾视之，非字而画……”二十余字，就清楚地记叙了成妻求虫的全过程。又如第四段：“成益愕，急逐趁之，蟆入草间。蹑迹披求，见有虫伏棘根。遽扑之，入石穴中。掭以尖草，不出；以水灌之，始出，状极俊健。逐而得之。审视，巨身修尾，青项金翅。大喜，笼归……”这是一段细节描写，作者去芜存杂，突出动作性，通过“逐”、“蹑 ”、“扑”、“掭”、“灌”、“视”等词，把成名捕虫的全过程描绘得纤细毕现，如在眼前。再如第七段：“试以猪鬣撩拨虫须，仍不动。少年又笑。屡撩之，虫暴怒，直奔，遂相腾击，振奋作声。俄见小虫跃起，张尾伸须，直纥敌领。”这一段文字也通过“怒”、“奔”、“跃”、“张”、“伸”、“纥”等词，把斗虫过程中促织的神态和动作写得细腻逼真。文章在精炼处惜字如金，但在形象处却又泼墨如水，细致入微，生动感人。如第六段：“未几，成归，闻妻言，如被冰雪。怒索儿，儿渺然不知所往。既而得尸于井，因而化怒为悲，抢呼欲绝。夫妻向隅，茅舍无烟，相对默然，不复聊赖。……成顾蟋蟀笼虚，则气断声吞，亦不以儿为念。自昏达曙，目不交睫。东曦既驾，僵卧长愁。”作者非常善于运用白描手法进行勾勒，描绘出人物亦怒亦悲亦愁的神态；又巧妙地借用景物衬托，以“茅舍无烟”（正衬）、“东曦既驾”（反衬）来表现成名夫妇“不复聊赖”的精神状态。

　　三、神态描写细致入微，人物形象栩栩如生。前面我已经讲过，中国古代小说十分注重情节性，甚至到了刻意的地步，而对人物形象的塑造略显不足。但《促织》不但主人公形象刻画得很成功，就连次要人物也塑造得栩栩如生，确属独树一帜。本文人物形象塑造的成功之处，主要在于神态描写。关于对成名的神态描写，前面已经提及，不再累述。让我们来看看对“游侠儿”的描绘吧。第七段：“村中少年好事者驯养一虫，自名‘蟹壳青’，日与弟子角，无不胜。欲居之以为利，而高其直，亦无售者。径造庐访成，视成所蓄，掩口胡卢而笑。因出己虫，纳比笼中。成视之，庞然修伟，自增惭怍，不敢与较。少年固强之。顾念蓄劣物终无所用，不如拼博一笑，因合纳斗盆中。小虫伏不动，蠢若木鸡。少年又大笑。试以猪鬣撩拨虫须，仍不动。少年又笑。屡撩之，虫暴怒，直奔，遂相腾击，振奋作声。俄见小虫跃起，张尾伸须，直纥敌领。少年大骇，急解令休止。”这一段中，少年共有三笑：第一次是他看见成名的促织“短小，黑赤色”，“形若土狗”，不由地“掩口胡卢而笑”，这一笑很形象地刻画出少年一副轻狂傲少的神态；第二次是他看见成名的促织“蠢若木鸡”，禁不住“又大笑”；第三次是他用猪鬣来挑逗促织，但“仍不动”，于是“又笑”， 得意至极。通过这“三笑”的描写，一个终日游手好闲、无所事事的游侠儿形象就栩栩如生跃然纸上了。而最终“少年大骇”，既衬托出促织的奇异，更进一步表现了人物的无知可笑的一面。此外，文中虽然对成名的妻子和儿子着墨不多，但精炼的数笔也很生动形象。若第五段：“儿惧，啼告母。母闻之，面色灰死，大惊曰：‘业根，死期至矣！而翁归，自与汝复算耳！’儿涕而去。”把成子的“恐惧”和成妻的“惊”、“怒”渲染得很成功。这样的例子很多，不再一一例举。

　　总之，《促织》既继承了中国古代小说创作的优秀传统，十分注重情节结构的营造；又能在语言方面推敲斟酌，做到精炼生动；并在人物形象的刻画上有所突破，使文中的人物都能栩栩如生，给人们留下了深刻印象，是一篇具有极强的艺术魅力的短篇小说精品.

　　《促织》是蒲氏的代表作之一。从内容看，显然是受柳宗元的《捕蛇者说》的影晌而写成的，其着眼点全在于揭露和讽刺上。小说通过主人翁成名从悲到喜、喜极生悲、悲极复喜，祸福转化的奇特故事情节，深刻地揭露了封建社会统治者“宫廷”的骄奢淫逸，以及各级官吏的媚上责下“假此科敛丁口”等等罪责，同时也提示了封建社会制度本身的黑暗和腐朽性。

# 【课内文言文精讲狂练】《狼》_蒲松龄

因篇幅问题，部分练习题省略了。

一、文学常识

1.作者：蒲松龄（1640—1715），字留仙，号柳泉居士，清代文学家，世称聊斋先生，山东淄川（今属淄博）人。创作出了杰出的文言小说集《聊斋志异》。

2．背景：本文选自《聊斋志异》卷六。原文共三则，本文选的是第二则，写的是一个屠户半路遇狼、杀狼的故事。明末清初时，汉人有双重的人生态度：一方面是抗清反满的遗民态度，另一方面则是高压之下对清朝异族统治者的臣服。蒲松龄受到这种双重人格的影响，所以有了《聊斋志异》一书。蒲松龄醉心科举，一心想求取功名；他才华横溢，然而屡试不第。强烈的反差使他愤愤不平，这种情绪贯穿他的一生，同时也深刻地影响了他对社会和人生的态度、取向以及评判。从某种意义上说，《聊斋志异》就是这一思想的产物。全书491篇，多以鬼狐故事反映现实生活，表露作者情感。

郭沫若对他的评价：写鬼写妖高人一等，刺贪刺虐入骨三分。

二、课文精讲

原文 狼 

一屠晚归，担中肉尽，止（1）有剩骨。途中两狼，缀（2）行甚远。

屠惧，投以骨（3）。一狼得骨止（4），一狼仍从（5）。复投之，后狼止而前狼又至。骨已尽矣，而两狼之并驱如故（6）。

屠大窘（7），恐前后受其敌（8）。顾（9）野有麦场，场主积薪（10）其中，苫蔽成丘（11）。屠乃奔倚其下，弛（12）担持刀。狼不敢前，眈眈相向（13）。

少时（14），一狼径去（15），其一犬坐于前（16）。久之（17），目似瞑（18），意暇甚（19）。屠暴（20）起，以刀劈狼首，又数刀毙之。方欲行，转视积薪后，一狼洞其中（21），意将隧入（22）以攻其后也。身已半入，止露尻（23）尾。屠自后断其股，亦毙之。乃悟前狼假寐（24），盖（25）以诱敌。

狼亦黠（26）矣，而顷刻（27）两毙，禽兽之变诈几何哉（28）？止增笑耳（29）。 

译文：

一个屠夫傍晚回家，担子里面的肉已经卖完，只有剩下的骨头。路上遇见两只狼，紧跟着走了很远。屠夫害怕了，把骨头扔给狼。一只狼得到骨头停下了。另一只狼仍然跟着他。屠夫又把骨头扔给狼，后面得到骨头的狼停下了，可是前面得到骨头的狼又赶到了。骨头已经扔完了。但是两只狼像原来一样一起追赶屠夫。

屠夫非常困窘急迫，恐怕前后一起受到狼的攻击。屠夫看见田野里有一个打麦场，打麦场的主人把柴草堆积在打麦场里，覆盖成小山（似的）。屠夫于是跑过去靠在柴草堆的下面，放下担子拿起屠刀。两只狼不敢上前，瞪着眼睛朝着屠夫。

一会儿，一只狼径直走开了，另一只狼像狗似的蹲坐在屠夫的前面。时间长了，那只狼的眼睛好像闭上了，神情悠闲得很。屠夫突然跳起，用刀砍狼的脑袋，又连砍几刀把狼杀死。屠夫刚想要走，转身看见柴草堆的后面，另一只狼正在柴草堆里打洞，打算要钻洞进去，来攻击屠夫的后面。身子已经钻进去了一半，只露出屁股和尾巴。屠夫从狼的后面砍断了狼的大腿，也把狼杀死了。屠夫这才明白前面的那只狼假装睡觉，原来是用这种方式来诱惑敌方。

狼也太狡猾了，可是一会儿两只狼都被杀死了，禽兽的欺骗手段能有多少呢？只给人们增加笑料罢了。

学习最后一段

12.作者的感叹是怎样的？这属于什么表达方式？

狼也太狡猾了，可是一会儿两只狼都被杀死了，禽兽的欺骗手段能有多少呢？只给人们增加笑料罢了。

议论

13.“止增笑耳”的仅仅是恶狼吗？作者嘲讽的仅仅是恶狼吗？从这个故事中你获得怎样的启发？

不是，狼在此实际上是恶人的化身，代表的是那种贪婪、凶狠、狡诈、愚蠢的恶人，说明对待这种像恶狼的恶人就应该像屠夫一样敢于斗争，善于斗争，这正是此文的寓意所在。

深入探究

14.本文的主角是狼还是屠户？为什么？

A.课文的主角是屠户。原因有三：

（1）课文的故事情节是围绕屠户展开的，从不幸遇狼到投骨喂狼，再到倚薪避狼，最后奋起劈狼

（2）课文表现了屠户由妥协到拼死自卫的心理变化过程

（3）文章的主题思想在于赞扬屠户面对凶恶的敌人，敢于斗争，善于斗争的精神。

B.课文的主角是狼。

文章是以狼为主角来叙事，并从狼自取灭亡的角度来归结故事的主旨的。狼在故事的发展中一直处于主导地位。开始是不停的追，想伺机吃掉屠户；屠户背倚积薪后，又是狼主动诱敌进攻。而屠户一直处于被动地位，迫不得已才进行自卫，奋起杀死两狼。

结构梳理



议论：止增笑耳

艺术特色

1.情节曲折，内容丰富。

本文虽然篇幅短小，但是结构紧凑，故事的发生、发展和结局交代得都很清楚。随着情节的展开，狼的贪婪、凶狠和狡诈的本性与屠户对狼的态度的变化过程写得波澜起伏，引人入胜。

2.语言简洁，形象生动。

如“缀行甚远”“并驱如故”等表现了狼的贪婪，“眈眈相向”“径去”“犬坐”“目似瞑，意暇甚”等表现了狼的狡诈，“惧”“投以骨”“复投之”等表现了一开始屠户的害怕心理和对狼的本性缺乏正确的认识。

（三）了解狼文化

人类已经从狼那里学来了哪些精神品质并且已经沿用了呢？

狼身上还有哪些精神品质值得人们去效法进而形成新的狼文化呢？

1、苍狼和白鹿--蒙古人起源的传说

据说，在北方， 有一座林木茂密的名叫额儿古涅.昆的山，山上有一个山洞。一天，一只苍狼，从这个山洞里走出来。后来这只狼碰到了一只作为它未来的伴侣的鹿，双双跑到了斡难河之源——不儿罕山（圣山），定居下来。那只苍狼 和那只白鹿在上天安排的这个地方相爱，生下一个儿子名叫巴塔赤罕。巴塔赤罕就是成吉思汗家族的祖先。

2、狼与罗马的建立

相传,罗马城的缔造者罗慕洛和他的弟弟在婴儿时期被坏人放在竹筐中丢弃在河里,幸被一头刚产下狼崽的母狼救起,并用自己的奶水喂养他们.后来,兄弟俩人长大成人,杀死了当年的仇人,并在母狼曾经哺育他们的山冈上建立了城堡,以自己的名字命名罗马城。 为了纪念他的母亲和父亲，罗慕洛后来封火神和灶神为罗马城的保护神。他设计了一座狼给两个男孩喂奶的雕像，把它作为罗马城的象征，这个城徽一直沿用至今。

3、姜戎的《狼图腾》简介

《狼图腾》由几十个有机连贯的“狼故事”一气呵成，情节紧张激烈而又新奇神秘。读者可从书中每一篇章、每个细节中攫取强烈的阅读快感，令人欲罢不能。那些精灵一般的蒙古草原狼随时从书中呼啸而出：狼的每一次侦察、布阵、伏击、奇袭的高超战术;狼对气象、地形的巧妙利用；狼的视死如归和不屈不挠；狼族中的友爱亲情；狼与草原万物的关系；倔强可爱的小狼在失去自由后艰难的成长过程——无不使我们联想到人类，进而思考人类历史中那些迄今县置未解的一个个疑问：当年区区十几万蒙古骑兵为什么能够横扫欧亚大陆？中华民族今日辽阔疆土由来的深层原因？历史上究竟是华夏文明征服了游牧民族，还是游牧民族一次次为汉民族输血才使中华文明得以延续？

一、 《狼》《黠鼠赋》比较练习

【甲】少时，一狼径去，其一犬坐于前。久之，目似瞑，意暇甚。屠暴起，以刀劈狼首，又数刀毙之。方欲行，转视积薪后，一狼洞其中，意将隧入以攻其后也。身已半入，止露尻尾。屠自后断其股，亦毙之。乃悟前狼假寐，盖以诱敌。

狼亦黠矣，而顷刻两毙，禽兽之变诈几何哉？止增笑耳。

——蒲松龄《狼》

【乙】苏子夜坐，有鼠方啮。拊①床而止之，既止复作。使童子烛之，有橐②中空。嘐嘐聱聱③，声在橐中。曰：“嘻！此鼠之见闭而不得去者也。”发而视之，寂无所有，举烛而索，中有死鼠。……覆而出之，堕地乃走，虽有敏者，莫措其手。

苏子叹曰：“异哉！是鼠之黠也。闭于橐中，橐坚而不可穴也。故不啮而啮，以声致人；不死而死，以形求脱也。吾闻有生，莫智于人。扰龙伐蛟，登龟狩麟，役万物而君之，卒见使于一鼠；堕此虫之计中，惊脱兔于处女。乌在其为智也。”

……若有告余者曰：“……不一于汝，而二于物，故一鼠之啮而为之变也。人能碎千金之璧，不能无失声于破釜；能搏猛虎，不能无变色于蜂虿④：此不一之患也。言出于汝，而忘之耶？”……

——苏轼《黠鼠赋》

【注】①拊（fǔ）：拍。②橐（tuó）：袋子。③嘐嘐（jiāo）聱（áo）聱：象声词，形容鼠咬物的声音。④虿（chài）：蝎子一类的毒虫。

想了解更多精彩内容，快来关注情感咨询师卓洛伊



也许很多人无法分辨喜欢和爱，觉得这两个词的含义是大同小异，如果你这样想就错了。喜欢只是对一个人或者某样事物的心动，就是有情感上的触动和感觉；爱则是对一个人或者某样事物发自内心的喜欢，是一种刻骨铭心的喜欢，可以为了对方甘愿付出自己的所有，只是为了博得红颜一笑。

喜欢一个人和爱一个人在本质上，是有很大的区别的。当你看到莫个人产生好感，喜欢上了她，你会不由自主做出亲近她的行为举止。你愿意去接近她，了解她，但是一旦发生什么事情的时候，你可以随时抽身离开，并不会引起你内心多大的触动，顶多就是难过一阵子。爱一个人，你就会想时时刻刻和她在一起。无论是在你工作忙碌的时候，还是在你有空余闲暇时间的时候，一想到她，你的内心就会一片柔软。即使你是一个钢铁五尺男儿，你的心也会柔软地一塌糊涂，整个胸腔都被她占据了，她就是你心中的女神！



喜欢和爱有什么区别？通常通过以下三种表现，你就可以判断你们两个人之间的感情属于哪一种？

1、喜欢只是心动，爱则是行动

每个人一生当中，可以遇到很多自己喜欢的人或者事物。比如你看到花园里一朵娇艳欲滴含苞怒放的玫瑰花，因为喜欢，你忍不住动手把它摘了下来。带回家以后，把它插在花瓶里，欣赏了几天以后，花枯萎了，你随手就把它丢弃了。而另一个真正爱这朵玫瑰花的人，因为他发自内心的喜欢这朵玫瑰花，也就是说喜欢的程度不一样，是一个真正爱花的人。他不愿意也不舍得去摘下这朵玫瑰花，他每天用心拿水去浇灌这朵玫瑰花，尽可能地延长这朵玫瑰花的生命和花期，让它的美丽可以绽放地更加长久。

就像一个女孩子她同时遇到了两个追求者，她觉得他们两个人都很好，不知道如何选择。一个每天都会早安晚安问候不断，感觉他是一个对感情很认真，而且也愿意投入感情的人；另一个追求者则是一个不善言辞，为人比较木讷内向的人。他平时很少说什么甜蜜的话语，但是只要有事情，他就会第一时间来到女孩的身边，帮她解决问题和困难。有一次女孩子感冒生病了，没有去公司上班。那个每天早晚问候的男生知道她生病了，立刻殷勤地打电话发信息过来，让女生多休息多喝水，然后就没有下文了。而那个木讷的男孩子知道她生病了没有上班，立刻下班后就去买了感冒药，连夜赶去女孩家，督促她把感冒药喝了。女孩最终选择了这个用行动来表达爱的男生，因为这才是真正的爱，愿意为对方付出，即使辛劳而不求回报。



2、喜欢是一时的感觉，爱则是一生的拥有

我们会在某一个特定的时刻，喜欢上某一个人或者事物，一旦脱离开那个环境，我们很快就会把这段感情忘却。例如很多人说旅行容易发生艳遇，容易找到爱情，但是也有可能只是一次爱情的快餐。一个人外出旅行，特别是对于单身的男女，如果你是一个思想相对Openging的人，确实很容易发生艳遇。因为人是属于群居动物，当他长期在一个人孤单寂寞的生活状态下，恰巧遇到了一个谈得来有感觉的人，两个人可能很快就产生了感情。但是这种感情来的快去的也快，随着旅程的结束，两个人很快回归到现实生活中，就会去权衡利弊这段感情的得与失。

喜欢一个人，你可以随时放手：爱一个人，你却希望这辈子永远牵住她的手，不离不弃。喜欢只是一时的心动，爱则是爱到骨子里，不愿放弃只想拥有她的感情。就像小孩子喜欢玩玩具一样，他可以今天玩积木，明天玩挖土机，随时可以更换，只要有玩具玩就可以了。爱一个人，则是把自己的感情全部托付出去，希望能够让对方幸福，希望得到对方的回应，希望可以一辈子拥有她，这辈子都不愿意分开。余生只想执子之手与子偕老，和你在一起的日子，就是最好的日子。我的人生因为遇到了你，才充满了爱的光芒幸福的光辉。

3、喜欢是可以替代的，爱则是全身心的投入

喜欢只是感情的其中一种表达方式，就是爱的深度不一样。就像很多人喜欢追星，他们可能今天喜欢这个明星，明天又喜欢另一个明星，就是感情很容易转变。但是大家对自己身边的爱人却不一样，因为她是自己的终身伴侣，所以感情可以长期持久稳定的维持下去。当然随着时间的流逝，可能感情会慢慢就过渡成了左手握右手的样子。爱情变成了亲情，彼此对对方的爱早已渗入进了彼此的身心，都已成为对方生命中的一部分。

爱人这个词是很神圣的，不要轻易谈爱，谈了就不要轻易分开。就像父爱，母爱，爱情，都是彼此渗透进了对方的生活里或生命中，是双方不可缺少的一部分。彼此之间都有对对方感情的依赖，愿意把自己所拥有的东西提供给对方，无论是金钱还是感情。只要看到对方欢快愉悦的笑脸，自己就满心欢喜非常满足。

一个走肾一个走心，喜欢是有底线的。出于客观或者主观原因，，你会主动放弃她。但是爱不同，你会为了她一次次放弃自己的底线。喜欢是索取和占有，而爱却是付出与长久。

如果在你的生命里，遇到了一个爱你宠你到骨子里的人，他愿意把自己所拥有的一切都给你。往后余生他只想和你一起走，一起经历人生的风风雨雨，无论是苦还是甜，他都愿意和你一起分享。也许他不会对你说什么甜言蜜语，但是无论他身在何处，他总是牵挂着你，他对你所有的爱都是用行动实实在在的表现出来。如果你遇到了一个这样对你的人，你就好好珍惜吧！不要再瞻前顾后了，往后或许再也遇不到比他更好的了。

怎么判断喜欢和爱的区别

印象中每次恋爱，说喜欢总会脱口而出，说爱似乎次数少之又少。我们很少会去特别认真的权衡两者的区别，却也会在日常中本能的分开。

我想，一份感情起初是喜欢，能长久在一起才是爱。喜欢是刹那瞬间的感觉，爱一定是经历时间的沉淀。而那种一开始就说爱不爱的，真的没必要太在意。



好的感情或许没必要去纠结是喜欢还是爱，两个人多点理解，多点包容，一起把心动的喜欢变成心安的爱，那或许就是最好的恋爱吧。

喜欢一个人很容易，努力爱一个人却很难。度过热恋期，就更应该让爱情变成亲情，让吸引变成彼此的依赖。按部就班于生活里的平平淡淡，也要努力让生活和感情有仪式感，有归属感。新鲜感永远都会存在，可责任感更应该束缚我们敬畏缘分，敬畏爱情。

这要看你想在这段感情里付出，还是想在这段感情里索取。

在一段两个人的恋情当中，真正的爱情是想为了那个人付出，想用自己的付出让对方幸福，在付出的同时得到对方的反馈，这才是幸福。

如果仅仅是欲望，那你在感情中就只想索取，哪怕对方已经付出了一切，你还是会觉得不够。

爱情是真诚的付出与回馈，是真心的希望对方能幸福。在一段感情生活当中，如果你真的喜欢一个人，你会特别在乎他的主观感受。

她的一颦一笑、一举一动，都会在你心里引起很大的反响。你害怕对方不开心，你害怕对方不快乐，你害怕你的付出不足够让对方幸福，你更害怕就这样失去对方。

内心的这种患得患失会让人付出的更频繁，付出的更多一些。我们是真的希望另一半能幸福，哪怕在时光中与我走散，也希望他能继续幸福下去。



怎么判断喜欢和爱？

喜欢一朵花，会摘下来，插在瓶里，枯萎了就丢掉，去摘下一朵。

爱一朵花，想好好呵护，除虫浇水，阳光雨露，盼它开的持久，即使谢了也能重开。

二十四节气

是中国人独有的浪漫与诗意

在天地万物的细节里

它们记录了光阴的故事

山川花鸟的万物情长

让在山南旅游的你

能清晰地感知到

在山南的四季中

雨水泛起的氤氲、花开的暗香盈盈

雪花纷飞的情意浓浓...... 

感受日月星辰的魅力

# 男人喜欢一个人，和爱一个人的区别_手机搜狐网

你分析得非常到位，确实在爱情中，男人对一个人的喜欢和爱是有着本质区别的。

喜欢往往是一时的冲动和表面的吸引，它可能源自于对方的外貌、性格或者某个瞬间的共鸣。这种喜欢可能会因为时间、距离或者新的吸引点的出现而逐渐消散。



而爱则是深入内心的情感，它基于更深的了解和共鸣。当一个男人真正爱上一个女人时，他会愿意为她付出一切，包括时间、精力甚至牺牲自己的利益。他会把对方放在心中最重要的位置，关心她的喜怒哀乐，愿意与她共度一生。



在爱情中，区分喜欢和爱是非常重要的。喜欢可能只是短暂的欢愉，而爱则是长久的陪伴和承诺。因此，对于女性来说，要理智地看待男人对自己的感情，不要轻易被一时的喜欢所迷惑，而要学会识别真正的爱情。



同时，也要珍惜那些真正爱自己的人，因为他们愿意与你共度人生的风雨，共同创造美好的未来。

也许很多人无法分辨喜欢和爱，觉得这两个词的含义是大同小异，如果你这样想就错了。喜欢只是对一个人或者某样事物的心动，就是有情感上的触动和感觉；爱则是对一个人或者某样事物发自内心的喜欢，是一种刻骨铭心的喜欢，可以为了对方甘愿付出自己的所有，只是为了博得红颜一笑。

喜欢一个人和爱一个人在本质上，是有很大的区别的。当你看到莫个人产生好感，喜欢上了她，你会不由自主做出亲近她的行为举止。你愿意去接近她，了解她，但是一旦发生什么事情的时候，你可以随时抽身离开，并不会引起你内心多大的触动，顶多就是难过一阵子。爱一个人，你就会想时时刻刻和她在一起。无论是在你工作忙碌的时候，还是在你有空余闲暇时间的时候，一想到她，你的内心就会一片柔软。即使你是一个钢铁五尺男儿，你的心也会柔软地一塌糊涂，整个胸腔都被她占据了，她就是你心中的女神！



喜欢和爱有什么区别？通常通过以下三种表现，你就可以判断你们两个人之间的感情属于哪一种？

1、喜欢只是心动，爱则是行动

每个人一生当中，可以遇到很多自己喜欢的人或者事物。比如你看到花园里一朵娇艳欲滴含苞怒放的玫瑰花，因为喜欢，你忍不住动手把它摘了下来。带回家以后，把它插在花瓶里，欣赏了几天以后，花枯萎了，你随手就把它丢弃了。而另一个真正爱这朵玫瑰花的人，因为他发自内心的喜欢这朵玫瑰花，也就是说喜欢的程度不一样，是一个真正爱花的人。他不愿意也不舍得去摘下这朵玫瑰花，他每天用心拿水去浇灌这朵玫瑰花，尽可能地延长这朵玫瑰花的生命和花期，让它的美丽可以绽放地更加长久。

就像一个女孩子她同时遇到了两个追求者，她觉得他们两个人都很好，不知道如何选择。一个每天都会早安晚安问候不断，感觉他是一个对感情很认真，而且也愿意投入感情的人；另一个追求者则是一个不善言辞，为人比较木讷内向的人。他平时很少说什么甜蜜的话语，但是只要有事情，他就会第一时间来到女孩的身边，帮她解决问题和困难。有一次女孩子感冒生病了，没有去公司上班。那个每天早晚问候的男生知道她生病了，立刻殷勤地打电话发信息过来，让女生多休息多喝水，然后就没有下文了。而那个木讷的男孩子知道她生病了没有上班，立刻下班后就去买了感冒药，连夜赶去女孩家，督促她把感冒药喝了。女孩最终选择了这个用行动来表达爱的男生，因为这才是真正的爱，愿意为对方付出，即使辛劳而不求回报。



2、喜欢是一时的感觉，爱则是一生的拥有

我们会在某一个特定的时刻，喜欢上某一个人或者事物，一旦脱离开那个环境，我们很快就会把这段感情忘却。例如很多人说旅行容易发生艳遇，容易找到爱情，但是也有可能只是一次爱情的快餐。一个人外出旅行，特别是对于单身的男女，如果你是一个思想相对Openging的人，确实很容易发生艳遇。因为人是属于群居动物，当他长期在一个人孤单寂寞的生活状态下，恰巧遇到了一个谈得来有感觉的人，两个人可能很快就产生了感情。但是这种感情来的快去的也快，随着旅程的结束，两个人很快回归到现实生活中，就会去权衡利弊这段感情的得与失。

喜欢一个人，你可以随时放手：爱一个人，你却希望这辈子永远牵住她的手，不离不弃。喜欢只是一时的心动，爱则是爱到骨子里，不愿放弃只想拥有她的感情。就像小孩子喜欢玩玩具一样，他可以今天玩积木，明天玩挖土机，随时可以更换，只要有玩具玩就可以了。爱一个人，则是把自己的感情全部托付出去，希望能够让对方幸福，希望得到对方的回应，希望可以一辈子拥有她，这辈子都不愿意分开。余生只想执子之手与子偕老，和你在一起的日子，就是最好的日子。我的人生因为遇到了你，才充满了爱的光芒幸福的光辉。

3、喜欢是可以替代的，爱则是全身心的投入

喜欢只是感情的其中一种表达方式，就是爱的深度不一样。就像很多人喜欢追星，他们可能今天喜欢这个明星，明天又喜欢另一个明星，就是感情很容易转变。但是大家对自己身边的爱人却不一样，因为她是自己的终身伴侣，所以感情可以长期持久稳定的维持下去。当然随着时间的流逝，可能感情会慢慢就过渡成了左手握右手的样子。爱情变成了亲情，彼此对对方的爱早已渗入进了彼此的身心，都已成为对方生命中的一部分。

爱人这个词是很神圣的，不要轻易谈爱，谈了就不要轻易分开。就像父爱，母爱，爱情，都是彼此渗透进了对方的生活里或生命中，是双方不可缺少的一部分。彼此之间都有对对方感情的依赖，愿意把自己所拥有的东西提供给对方，无论是金钱还是感情。只要看到对方欢快愉悦的笑脸，自己就满心欢喜非常满足。

一个走肾一个走心，喜欢是有底线的。出于客观或者主观原因，，你会主动放弃她。但是爱不同，你会为了她一次次放弃自己的底线。喜欢是索取和占有，而爱却是付出与长久。

如果在你的生命里，遇到了一个爱你宠你到骨子里的人，他愿意把自己所拥有的一切都给你。往后余生他只想和你一起走，一起经历人生的风风雨雨，无论是苦还是甜，他都愿意和你一起分享。也许他不会对你说什么甜言蜜语，但是无论他身在何处，他总是牵挂着你，他对你所有的爱都是用行动实实在在的表现出来。如果你遇到了一个这样对你的人，你就好好珍惜吧！不要再瞻前顾后了，往后或许再也遇不到比他更好的了。

怎么判断喜欢和爱的区别

印象中每次恋爱，说喜欢总会脱口而出，说爱似乎次数少之又少。我们很少会去特别认真的权衡两者的区别，却也会在日常中本能的分开。

我想，一份感情起初是喜欢，能长久在一起才是爱。喜欢是刹那瞬间的感觉，爱一定是经历时间的沉淀。而那种一开始就说爱不爱的，真的没必要太在意。



好的感情或许没必要去纠结是喜欢还是爱，两个人多点理解，多点包容，一起把心动的喜欢变成心安的爱，那或许就是最好的恋爱吧。

喜欢一个人很容易，努力爱一个人却很难。度过热恋期，就更应该让爱情变成亲情，让吸引变成彼此的依赖。按部就班于生活里的平平淡淡，也要努力让生活和感情有仪式感，有归属感。新鲜感永远都会存在，可责任感更应该束缚我们敬畏缘分，敬畏爱情。

这要看你想在这段感情里付出，还是想在这段感情里索取。

在一段两个人的恋情当中，真正的爱情是想为了那个人付出，想用自己的付出让对方幸福，在付出的同时得到对方的反馈，这才是幸福。

如果仅仅是欲望，那你在感情中就只想索取，哪怕对方已经付出了一切，你还是会觉得不够。

爱情是真诚的付出与回馈，是真心的希望对方能幸福。在一段感情生活当中，如果你真的喜欢一个人，你会特别在乎他的主观感受。

她的一颦一笑、一举一动，都会在你心里引起很大的反响。你害怕对方不开心，你害怕对方不快乐，你害怕你的付出不足够让对方幸福，你更害怕就这样失去对方。

内心的这种患得患失会让人付出的更频繁，付出的更多一些。我们是真的希望另一半能幸福，哪怕在时光中与我走散，也希望他能继续幸福下去。



怎么判断喜欢和爱？

喜欢一朵花，会摘下来，插在瓶里，枯萎了就丢掉，去摘下一朵。

爱一朵花，想好好呵护，除虫浇水，阳光雨露，盼它开的持久，即使谢了也能重开。

二十四节气

是中国人独有的浪漫与诗意

在天地万物的细节里

它们记录了光阴的故事

山川花鸟的万物情长

让在山南旅游的你

能清晰地感知到

在山南的四季中

雨水泛起的氤氲、花开的暗香盈盈

雪花纷飞的情意浓浓...... 

感受日月星辰的魅力

# 男人喜欢一个人，和爱一个人的区别_手机搜狐网

你分析得非常到位，确实在爱情中，男人对一个人的喜欢和爱是有着本质区别的。

喜欢往往是一时的冲动和表面的吸引，它可能源自于对方的外貌、性格或者某个瞬间的共鸣。这种喜欢可能会因为时间、距离或者新的吸引点的出现而逐渐消散。



而爱则是深入内心的情感，它基于更深的了解和共鸣。当一个男人真正爱上一个女人时，他会愿意为她付出一切，包括时间、精力甚至牺牲自己的利益。他会把对方放在心中最重要的位置，关心她的喜怒哀乐，愿意与她共度一生。



在爱情中，区分喜欢和爱是非常重要的。喜欢可能只是短暂的欢愉，而爱则是长久的陪伴和承诺。因此，对于女性来说，要理智地看待男人对自己的感情，不要轻易被一时的喜欢所迷惑，而要学会识别真正的爱情。



同时，也要珍惜那些真正爱自己的人，因为他们愿意与你共度人生的风雨，共同创造美好的未来。

# 喜欢和爱有什么区别？如何判断两人间的情感属于哪一种呢？_感情_一个人_对方

也许很多人无法分辨喜欢和爱，觉得这两个词的含义是大同小异，如果你这样想就错了。喜欢只是对一个人或者某样事物的心动，就是有情感上的触动和感觉；爱则是对一个人或者某样事物发自内心的喜欢，是一种刻骨铭心的喜欢，可以为了对方甘愿付出自己的所有，只是为了博得红颜一笑。

喜欢一个人和爱一个人在本质上，是有很大的区别的。当你看到莫个人产生好感，喜欢上了她，你会不由自主做出亲近她的行为举止。你愿意去接近她，了解她，但是一旦发生什么事情的时候，你可以随时抽身离开，并不会引起你内心多大的触动，顶多就是难过一阵子。爱一个人，你就会想时时刻刻和她在一起。无论是在你工作忙碌的时候，还是在你有空余闲暇时间的时候，一想到她，你的内心就会一片柔软。即使你是一个钢铁五尺男儿，你的心也会柔软地一塌糊涂，整个胸腔都被她占据了，她就是你心中的女神！



喜欢和爱有什么区别？通常通过以下三种表现，你就可以判断你们两个人之间的感情属于哪一种？

1、喜欢只是心动，爱则是行动

每个人一生当中，可以遇到很多自己喜欢的人或者事物。比如你看到花园里一朵娇艳欲滴含苞怒放的玫瑰花，因为喜欢，你忍不住动手把它摘了下来。带回家以后，把它插在花瓶里，欣赏了几天以后，花枯萎了，你随手就把它丢弃了。而另一个真正爱这朵玫瑰花的人，因为他发自内心的喜欢这朵玫瑰花，也就是说喜欢的程度不一样，是一个真正爱花的人。他不愿意也不舍得去摘下这朵玫瑰花，他每天用心拿水去浇灌这朵玫瑰花，尽可能地延长这朵玫瑰花的生命和花期，让它的美丽可以绽放地更加长久。

就像一个女孩子她同时遇到了两个追求者，她觉得他们两个人都很好，不知道如何选择。一个每天都会早安晚安问候不断，感觉他是一个对感情很认真，而且也愿意投入感情的人；另一个追求者则是一个不善言辞，为人比较木讷内向的人。他平时很少说什么甜蜜的话语，但是只要有事情，他就会第一时间来到女孩的身边，帮她解决问题和困难。有一次女孩子感冒生病了，没有去公司上班。那个每天早晚问候的男生知道她生病了，立刻殷勤地打电话发信息过来，让女生多休息多喝水，然后就没有下文了。而那个木讷的男孩子知道她生病了没有上班，立刻下班后就去买了感冒药，连夜赶去女孩家，督促她把感冒药喝了。女孩最终选择了这个用行动来表达爱的男生，因为这才是真正的爱，愿意为对方付出，即使辛劳而不求回报。



2、喜欢是一时的感觉，爱则是一生的拥有

我们会在某一个特定的时刻，喜欢上某一个人或者事物，一旦脱离开那个环境，我们很快就会把这段感情忘却。例如很多人说旅行容易发生艳遇，容易找到爱情，但是也有可能只是一次爱情的快餐。一个人外出旅行，特别是对于单身的男女，如果你是一个思想相对Openging的人，确实很容易发生艳遇。因为人是属于群居动物，当他长期在一个人孤单寂寞的生活状态下，恰巧遇到了一个谈得来有感觉的人，两个人可能很快就产生了感情。但是这种感情来的快去的也快，随着旅程的结束，两个人很快回归到现实生活中，就会去权衡利弊这段感情的得与失。

喜欢一个人，你可以随时放手：爱一个人，你却希望这辈子永远牵住她的手，不离不弃。喜欢只是一时的心动，爱则是爱到骨子里，不愿放弃只想拥有她的感情。就像小孩子喜欢玩玩具一样，他可以今天玩积木，明天玩挖土机，随时可以更换，只要有玩具玩就可以了。爱一个人，则是把自己的感情全部托付出去，希望能够让对方幸福，希望得到对方的回应，希望可以一辈子拥有她，这辈子都不愿意分开。余生只想执子之手与子偕老，和你在一起的日子，就是最好的日子。我的人生因为遇到了你，才充满了爱的光芒幸福的光辉。

3、喜欢是可以替代的，爱则是全身心的投入

喜欢只是感情的其中一种表达方式，就是爱的深度不一样。就像很多人喜欢追星，他们可能今天喜欢这个明星，明天又喜欢另一个明星，就是感情很容易转变。但是大家对自己身边的爱人却不一样，因为她是自己的终身伴侣，所以感情可以长期持久稳定的维持下去。当然随着时间的流逝，可能感情会慢慢就过渡成了左手握右手的样子。爱情变成了亲情，彼此对对方的爱早已渗入进了彼此的身心，都已成为对方生命中的一部分。

爱人这个词是很神圣的，不要轻易谈爱，谈了就不要轻易分开。就像父爱，母爱，爱情，都是彼此渗透进了对方的生活里或生命中，是双方不可缺少的一部分。彼此之间都有对对方感情的依赖，愿意把自己所拥有的东西提供给对方，无论是金钱还是感情。只要看到对方欢快愉悦的笑脸，自己就满心欢喜非常满足。

一个走肾一个走心，喜欢是有底线的。出于客观或者主观原因，，你会主动放弃她。但是爱不同，你会为了她一次次放弃自己的底线。喜欢是索取和占有，而爱却是付出与长久。

如果在你的生命里，遇到了一个爱你宠你到骨子里的人，他愿意把自己所拥有的一切都给你。往后余生他只想和你一起走，一起经历人生的风风雨雨，无论是苦还是甜，他都愿意和你一起分享。也许他不会对你说什么甜言蜜语，但是无论他身在何处，他总是牵挂着你，他对你所有的爱都是用行动实实在在的表现出来。如果你遇到了一个这样对你的人，你就好好珍惜吧！不要再瞻前顾后了，往后或许再也遇不到比他更好的了。

怎么判断喜欢和爱的区别

印象中每次恋爱，说喜欢总会脱口而出，说爱似乎次数少之又少。我们很少会去特别认真的权衡两者的区别，却也会在日常中本能的分开。

我想，一份感情起初是喜欢，能长久在一起才是爱。喜欢是刹那瞬间的感觉，爱一定是经历时间的沉淀。而那种一开始就说爱不爱的，真的没必要太在意。



好的感情或许没必要去纠结是喜欢还是爱，两个人多点理解，多点包容，一起把心动的喜欢变成心安的爱，那或许就是最好的恋爱吧。

喜欢一个人很容易，努力爱一个人却很难。度过热恋期，就更应该让爱情变成亲情，让吸引变成彼此的依赖。按部就班于生活里的平平淡淡，也要努力让生活和感情有仪式感，有归属感。新鲜感永远都会存在，可责任感更应该束缚我们敬畏缘分，敬畏爱情。

这要看你想在这段感情里付出，还是想在这段感情里索取。

在一段两个人的恋情当中，真正的爱情是想为了那个人付出，想用自己的付出让对方幸福，在付出的同时得到对方的反馈，这才是幸福。

如果仅仅是欲望，那你在感情中就只想索取，哪怕对方已经付出了一切，你还是会觉得不够。

爱情是真诚的付出与回馈，是真心的希望对方能幸福。在一段感情生活当中，如果你真的喜欢一个人，你会特别在乎他的主观感受。

她的一颦一笑、一举一动，都会在你心里引起很大的反响。你害怕对方不开心，你害怕对方不快乐，你害怕你的付出不足够让对方幸福，你更害怕就这样失去对方。

内心的这种患得患失会让人付出的更频繁，付出的更多一些。我们是真的希望另一半能幸福，哪怕在时光中与我走散，也希望他能继续幸福下去。



怎么判断喜欢和爱？

喜欢一朵花，会摘下来，插在瓶里，枯萎了就丢掉，去摘下一朵。

爱一朵花，想好好呵护，除虫浇水，阳光雨露，盼它开的持久，即使谢了也能重开。

# 男人喜欢一个人，和爱一个人的区别_手机搜狐网

你分析得非常到位，确实在爱情中，男人对一个人的喜欢和爱是有着本质区别的。

喜欢往往是一时的冲动和表面的吸引，它可能源自于对方的外貌、性格或者某个瞬间的共鸣。这种喜欢可能会因为时间、距离或者新的吸引点的出现而逐渐消散。



而爱则是深入内心的情感，它基于更深的了解和共鸣。当一个男人真正爱上一个女人时，他会愿意为她付出一切，包括时间、精力甚至牺牲自己的利益。他会把对方放在心中最重要的位置，关心她的喜怒哀乐，愿意与她共度一生。



在爱情中，区分喜欢和爱是非常重要的。喜欢可能只是短暂的欢愉，而爱则是长久的陪伴和承诺。因此，对于女性来说，要理智地看待男人对自己的感情，不要轻易被一时的喜欢所迷惑，而要学会识别真正的爱情。



同时，也要珍惜那些真正爱自己的人，因为他们愿意与你共度人生的风雨，共同创造美好的未来。

# 迷茫人生如何自救？这些建议让你重拾生活的希望与方向！_行动_灵感_决心

                        )，代表其在平台内的综合表现越好。
                    

在这个瞬息万变的世界里，迷茫和困惑成了我们时常难以逃避的现实。你是否曾陷入对未来的迷茫，不知道自己该何去何从？曾经的激情和目标仿佛渐行渐远，生活的轨迹变得模糊不清。但请别放弃！因为我将为你揭示一些重拾生活希望与方向的秘籍。本文将为你提供一系列的建议，帮助你打破迷茫的束缚，重新找回前行的力量。



迷茫人生的原因：揭示人们在迷失中的内心和外部因素

内心的原因是迷茫的主要源头之一。内心的迷茫往往表现为对自己的价值观、目标和意义的混淆。当一个人无法确定自己的追求是什么时，他就容易迷失自我。现代社会中对成功定义的多元化和社会价值观念的多样性，给人们带来了更多选择的困扰。一方面，我们渴望出色地完成任务和获得他人的认可；另一方面，我们追求内心的平静和意义的实现。当我们无法找到一条符合自己的生活轨迹时，往往会陷入迷茫之中。

外部的因素也会对人们的人生路径产生巨大的影响。社会环境、家庭背景、教育方式等都会给每个人的人生带来不同的压力。社会的竞争激烈和发展速度快，使得我们常常感到无奈和措手不及。特别是在人际关系中，我们往往会受到他人的期望和压力的影响，导致迷失自我、追随起伏不定的方向。



然而，我们也应该明白，迷茫人生并非终点，而是一个机会。正如卡夫卡所言：“不求有功，但求无过。”迷茫人生正是给我们提供了自我反省和重新规划的机会。在迷茫中，我们可以更加透彻地去了解自己的内心需求和价值观，重新审视自己的人生目标和追求。通过自我探索，在探索的过程中，我们会逐渐找回自己，明确自己的方向和意义。

那么，如何从迷茫中走出来呢？首先，我们需要承认自己的不确定性和迷茫感。接着，我们可以通过积极主动地寻找机会和经验来获得更多的启示。例如，读书、旅行、参加各类活动以及与他人交流等，都能够帮助我们开拓眼界和丰富内心。此外，找到一位值得信赖的导师或者是心理咨询师也是很有帮助的，他们可以提供专业的指导和支持，助我们走出困境，重新找到方向。



自救心路历程：灵感、决心和行动，如何逐步摆脱迷茫的困境？

灵感是启发我们走出迷茫的重要力量。当我们处于困境中时，常常会感到身心俱疲，缺乏动力和方向感。但是，灵感能够在瞬间点燃我们内心的火焰，让我们再次燃起信念。灵感可能来自于他人的鼓励和激励，也可能来自于我们自己内心深处的某种想法或感悟。无论灵感的来源如何，它都是我们摆脱迷茫的起点。

仅仅有灵感是不够的，我们还需要决心来坚持下去。决心是一种内在的力量，它使我们能够冷静地面对困境，坚定地向前迈步。在迷茫中，我们常常会陷入无尽的循环思维中，忧虑和焦虑无时无刻不在困扰着我们。但是，当我们下定决心时，我们会明确我们要摆脱困境，找到自己的出路。决心能够帮助我们克服困难，找到解决问题的办法。

然而，决心仅仅停留在思考和计划上是不够的，行动是关键。在摆脱迷茫的过程中，行动是最重要的一步。毕竟，只有通过实际行动，我们才能真正改变现状。行动不仅意味着我们必须采取具体的步骤和措施，还意味着我们必须勇于面对和解决我们面临的问题。行动是一个迈过困境的重要桥梁，它能够让我们逐渐意识到我们的潜力和能力。



在实践中，灵感、决心和行动相互交织，相互促进。灵感给予我们动力，决心给予我们坚持的力量，行动则是我们实现目标的手段。当我们积极采取行动时，我们会逐渐发现我们所面临的困境并不是我们想象的那么复杂，我们能够克服许多看似无解的问题。行动也会让我们获得实际的成果和经验，进一步增强我们的自信心和决心。

摆脱迷茫的过程是一个个体化的过程，每个人的路程可能会不同。但是，无论我们面临什么样的困境，灵感、决心和行动都是我们摆脱迷茫的强大工具。通过灵感的启迪，我们找到了方向；通过决心的坚持，我们将困难化为动力；通过行动的实施，我们最终走出了迷茫。以此为基础，我们能够逐步建立自己的信念和自我认同，找到自己的价值和目标，从而过上充满意义的生活。



揭示一些行之有效的方法，让你重新获得希望和方向

明确目标。当我们感到迷茫和失落时，很可能是因为我们对自己想要的目标不够清晰。所以，通过思考和反思，确立你想要实现的目标，这将帮助你重新找回人生的方向。明确的目标可以帮助你更好地规划你的行动步骤，并提供一个追求的动力。

积极思考。积极思考是获得希望和方向的重要组成部分。我们在面对困难和逆境时，往往会感到绝望和无助，但转变思维方式，并将注意力放在积极的事物上，可以帮助我们看到更多的机会和可能性。尝试每天写下几个积极的事情，并以积极的态度对待所面临的挑战，这将逐渐培养出积极思考的习惯。

追求个人成长。学习与成长是实现人生目标的重要驱动力。通过不断学习新的技能、知识和经验，我们可以不断丰富自己，提高自己的能力和自信心。参加培训课程、阅读自助书籍、结交志同道合的人，都是推动个人成长的有效途径。努力成为一个不断进步的人，你将发现越来越多的机会和方向将向你敞开。



保持健康和积极的生活方式。身体和心理的健康是我们获得希望和方向的基石。充足的睡眠、健康的饮食、适量的锻炼以及良好的心理健康才能保持我们的能量和积极的心态。在日常生活中，养成良好的生活习惯，给自己安排充足的休息和娱乐时间，可以增加我们从困境中恢复过来的能力。

寻求支持。当我们感到迷茫和失望时，与信任的朋友、家人或心理咨询师交流是至关重要的。他们可以给予我们支持、理解和建议。同时，寻求他人的经验和见解，也为我们提供了新的想法和方向。不要孤立自己，与他人分享你的困境和期望，这样你会发现自己并不孤单，获得帮助和支持的机会也更多。

无论迷茫多深，相信内心的力量会引领你找到属于自己的道路。让我们一起勇敢前行，期待未来的美好！

# 迷茫时该怎么办？如何找到人生方向并度过迷茫期？_思考_时间_计划


                        由内容质量、互动评论、分享传播等多维度分值决定，勋章级别越高(
                        
                        )，代表其在平台内的综合表现越好。
                    

身处迷茫的困境是许多人都会经历的一种心理状态。这种状态会让我们不确定未来的方向，不清楚自己应该做什么，甚至不知道如何选择。但是，当你处于这种状态时，最重要的是让自己冷静下来，理清思路，并找到内心真正热爱的事情或值得长期努力的事业。以下是一些建议，帮助你从迷茫中走出来。

1.给自己时间思考无论你有多忙，都要给自己留出时间来思考。这种思考并不一定要多么复杂或深入，但需要认真去面对自己内心的想法和感受。可以回顾一下过去的生活，思考一下自己的兴趣爱好、价值观、目标和梦想。问问自己究竟想过什么样的生活，什么对自己来说最重要。通过反思和思考，你可以更好地了解自己，找到自己的兴趣所在，为未来制定计划。



2.制定合理的计划当你找到了自己真正喜欢的事情后，要根据自己的实际情况和外部环境来制定合理的计划。这个计划应该包括具体的目标、步骤和时间表。要明确自己的优势、不足以及需要改进的地方。同时，要学会从失败中汲取经验教训，不断完善自己的计划。制定计划可以帮助你更好地掌控自己的时间和行动，让自己的目标更加明确和具体。

3.寻找榜样和咨询高手有时候我们会感到迷茫，不知道该怎么做。这时候，可以寻找一些与自己类似的成功人士作为榜样，学习他们的成长经历和经验。通过了解他们的成功路径，我们可以更好地找到适合自己的道路。此外，还可以向身边的高手或过来人请教，他们的经验和建议往往能帮助我们少走弯路，更快地找到成功的方向。



4.勇于尝试和调整有些困难是我们自己想象出来的，实际上并没有那么可怕。因此，要勇于尝试并不断地调整自己的计划。要了解自己的试错点和不足之处，及时进行调整和修正。同时，要学会从失败中汲取经验教训，不断完善自己的计划。不要害怕犯错或失败，因为这些经历可以帮助我们更好地成长和进步。

5.调节情绪和接纳自己当我们处于迷茫状态时，往往会感到焦虑、恐惧和不自信。这时候，要学会调节自己的情绪，让自己保持冷静和乐观。同时，要接纳自己的现状，不要过于和别人比较。每个人都有自己独特的优势和不足之处，只要和自己过去相比有进步就是成功的。要保持积极的心态，不断激励自己继续前进。



6.长期主义和发挥时间的复利效应最后，要树立长期主义的心态。成功往往需要时间和耐心，不要急于求成或轻言放弃。要将长期的大目标分解成阶段性小目标，通过不断地完成小目标来积累信心和动力。同时，要学会发挥时间的复利效应，不断地积累经验和知识，让自己在未来获得更大的成功。

总之，走出迷茫需要一定的时间和努力。通过认真思考、制定计划、寻找榜样、勇于尝试、调节情绪、接纳自己和树立长期主义心态等措施，我们可以逐渐摆脱迷茫的状态，找到适合自己的成功之路。希望以上建议对你有所帮助，加油！返回搜狐，查看更多

【以下文章来源于鱼堂主爱思考 ，作者鱼堂主】

迷茫的原因有很多，大部分都是自己面对未来的不确定性不知道以后会过什么样的生活，但心里清楚自己恐惧什么样的未来。

你想努力可是你又不知道自己适合什么方向。

也可能你有自己喜欢的事，但又觉得没办法变成职业。

就这样你开始陷入对自己的怀疑，对未来充满无力感。在面对迷茫的压力时，每个人用不同的方式去应对焦虑。
最常见的方法是“逃避”。
有些人用打游戏来逃避现实，有些人靠刷剧来转移注意力。他们都希望通过这些行为让自己可以短暂地逃避那些需要面对的问题和选择。
虽然玩游戏和刷剧可以让人短暂地忘记迷茫，但每次游戏结束、电影看完后，你又会被一股更大的焦虑和无力感包围。你知道这样的状态对迷茫没有任何帮助，却又不得不一次次靠游戏影剧续命。迷茫在每个人生阶段都会遇到。之所以我们感到迷茫，说明我们开始对自己的生活进行思考，需要重新认识自己、了解自己、探索自己。
不是给你鼓劲，你就可以马上从焦虑迷茫中走出来。这些只能给你带来短期刺激，并不能真正地帮你解决问题，只是通过精神胜利法帮你看开点。
我建议你好好利用好迷茫期，把它当成重新认识自己的机会，学会跟自己相处，重新出发探索未来。
没有经历过迷茫、挣扎、思考做出的选择，都无法真正地指导你的人生。
这里有5个方法帮助你走出迷茫期。
NO.1 过好每一天无论是逃避还是忽视，都不是解决迷茫的好方法，最好的方法是坚定地过好每一天。把每天过好了，那种扎实的生活感觉就会给你带来力量。
给自己一点时间慢慢想，了解自己想要什么，明白自己真正想做什么，不要回避内心的声音。这个过程需要一点时间。其他方法都只能暂时压制。倘若有些问题想不通，迷茫就会一直跟着你走。
我们在迷茫时总会想一些还未发生、感觉很难解决的问题。这些问题都比较空泛，没有一个实在的事情承载。所以你想解决也无从下手。
比如说家里乱糟糟的。家里乱是一个实在的问题。你只要去整理。问题就会被解决。
但是迷茫没办法解决。比如，你担心未来生活不好，担心以后过得不幸福。这些问题没办法马上解决，自然就会让你感觉到无力。
迷茫会让人被巨大的焦虑感所包围。这些压力会打破你本来的生活节奏，而生活一旦变得不规律，就会让人对生活失去掌控感。这个感觉让你进一步觉得生活一团糟。
最好的方法不是幻想马上解决迷茫的问题，而是我们先踏踏实实地活好每一天，放下好高骛远的想法，把心沉下来，把手上的小事开始做好。
你可以尝试着跑跑步，在家做点健身项目，或者学习做饭等。这些看着不起眼、实际很有烟火气息的事情，最能抚慰一个人的内心。
在这个过程中，你会重新找到对生活的掌控感。一件件的小事会重新给你带来生活的希望。
更重要的一点是这些事情都是可以掌控的。对于一个迷茫的人来说，有一些每天可以掌控的事，能帮助自己重拾对生活的信心。
规律的生活、可以掌控的日常都可以减弱你的焦虑感。
NO.2 积累生活中的点点滴滴坚持一件小事，时间久了就可以变成一种心里寄托。
反正没人知道未来会怎么样，我们只能尽量为以后攒下积累、做好准备去面对未知。
可以是读书，可以是跑步，可以是摄影，什么事都可以。前提是要做能积累的事情。虽然这些事情我们短期可能看不到反馈，但你要清楚长期坚持下来，一定会给你带来好的结果。而我在迷茫的时候选择了读书和写作。
迷茫最核心的两个问题：
第一，不知该如何选择。
第二，不知道该怎么办。
这两个问题的本质可以看作是对世界的知之甚少。最好的方法当然是找一位经验丰富的老师，一点点带着你走出迷茫。
这对于普通人来说还是很难的。首先你不一定认识这样的人。其实就算你认识了，别人也很难花大量的时间在你身上。因为这个世界的本质就是交换。
这个时候读书可能是帮助自己、了解世界的最优途径。
面对迷茫我们依然不知该如何面对，如何去解决，但我们可以慢慢做出改变。为自己做事的踏实感也会影响你的心态。
这些看似不起眼的小事，最终会帮助你一点点走出迷茫，找到自己的目标。在迷茫的时候选择做一些长期才能看到结果的事，也可以让你的心态更加平稳。
NO.3 不必跟他人比较天下第一大蠢事，就是跟人比较。天下第一聪明事，就是跟人学习。
别人怎么样，那是他的事，无论好坏跟你没有关系。你可以羡慕别人，但不要陷入盲目的攀比。
其实羡慕也是一种动力。你希望自己过得更好，期待自己同样成功。
就怕你陷入攀比，总是接受不了自己比别人差。
经济学里有个理论叫“比较优势”。意思是每个人跟自己比，发现自己某个方面会更加有优势。
记住是跟自己比的优势，在你的能力范围内，做什么事达到的效果最好，你就去选择做什么事。至于别人在这件事上是否比你厉害并不重要。因为每个人都有自己的比较优势。虽然他比你厉害，但是他跟你竞争可能不划算，因为他有更大优势的工作可以做。
比如，你整理房间特别厉害。马云整理房间可能比你还厉害。虽然马云在整理房间上比你有优势，但并非是他自己的比较优势。他的比较优势是管理公司。不是他不能做整理房间的工作， 只是做这个对他来说收益太低了。
比较优势就是这样的道理，不是从心态上战胜对方，而是通过实实在在的推理得出结论。
NO.4 保持住精神面貌这是个很小的建议，但是对生活的帮助很大。行为真的可以影响心态，只要你自己不放弃，就有机会发生改变。
感觉特别焦虑迷茫的时候，感觉自己坐卧不安的时候，你可以打扫一下房间，做一点不用太多思考的事情，只要手上有实在的事情去做，心里就会产生安全感。
这个建议的核心是不能放任自己，人活着就是为了一口气。无论此刻的生活状况如何，我们都要把自己收拾干净，保持住精神面貌。这样就会改善懒散的个人状态。即使迷茫的时候，也应该以饱满的精神状态去面对生活。
环境可以改变一个人。这个道理大家都懂。因此在日常生活中，我们更加要保持良好的环境。
NO.5 迷茫是了解自己的机会无论是跟自己谈话，还是通过日记记录想法，都是了解自我的好机会。对自己越了解，对决策帮助越大。
对于我而言，写作就是跟自己的对话。我就是在一次次的写作中，逐渐找到方向，慢慢了解自己想做什么的。
如果你感觉迷茫，又不知道问题出在哪里，可以经常记录一下自己的情绪，经常复盘，也是逐渐了解自己的一个过程。
写作还有一个好处。那就是你一旦写出来，便可以用第三视角来看待问题。这样就不会过度地被自我的情绪困扰，你能通过一个更加冷静的视角重新审视自己的生活。
只有了解自己，才能明白自己想做什么。有了目标，你就走出了迷茫。
对于未来，谁都不知道会发生什么，不确定性一直会存在，但是我们已经跟自己达成一致，一起去探索未知的世界。
迷茫最好的解决方法，就是去面对它，而不是去逃避。
你寻找答案的过程，就是你度过一生的历程。
人生每一步都不会浪费，因为每一步都是你的人生。
如果此刻你也在处于迷茫阶段，希望你能有尝试面对迷茫焦虑的勇气。
直面自我，可能是迷茫带来的礼物。本文节选自《智识升级：让你的付出有回报》，欢迎阅读本书来了解如何真正做到“让努力看得见，付出有回报”！

最常见的方法是“逃避”。

有些人用打游戏来逃避现实，有些人靠刷剧来转移注意力。他们都希望通过这些行为让自己可以短暂地逃避那些需要面对的问题和选择。

虽然玩游戏和刷剧可以让人短暂地忘记迷茫，但每次游戏结束、电影看完后，你又会被一股更大的焦虑和无力感包围。你知道这样的状态对迷茫没有任何帮助，却又不得不一次次靠游戏影剧续命。迷茫在每个人生阶段都会遇到。之所以我们感到迷茫，说明我们开始对自己的生活进行思考，需要重新认识自己、了解自己、探索自己。
不是给你鼓劲，你就可以马上从焦虑迷茫中走出来。这些只能给你带来短期刺激，并不能真正地帮你解决问题，只是通过精神胜利法帮你看开点。
我建议你好好利用好迷茫期，把它当成重新认识自己的机会，学会跟自己相处，重新出发探索未来。
没有经历过迷茫、挣扎、思考做出的选择，都无法真正地指导你的人生。
这里有5个方法帮助你走出迷茫期。
NO.1 过好每一天无论是逃避还是忽视，都不是解决迷茫的好方法，最好的方法是坚定地过好每一天。把每天过好了，那种扎实的生活感觉就会给你带来力量。
给自己一点时间慢慢想，了解自己想要什么，明白自己真正想做什么，不要回避内心的声音。这个过程需要一点时间。其他方法都只能暂时压制。倘若有些问题想不通，迷茫就会一直跟着你走。
我们在迷茫时总会想一些还未发生、感觉很难解决的问题。这些问题都比较空泛，没有一个实在的事情承载。所以你想解决也无从下手。
比如说家里乱糟糟的。家里乱是一个实在的问题。你只要去整理。问题就会被解决。
但是迷茫没办法解决。比如，你担心未来生活不好，担心以后过得不幸福。这些问题没办法马上解决，自然就会让你感觉到无力。
迷茫会让人被巨大的焦虑感所包围。这些压力会打破你本来的生活节奏，而生活一旦变得不规律，就会让人对生活失去掌控感。这个感觉让你进一步觉得生活一团糟。
最好的方法不是幻想马上解决迷茫的问题，而是我们先踏踏实实地活好每一天，放下好高骛远的想法，把心沉下来，把手上的小事开始做好。

# 排名前1%的高中生靠天赋还是靠努力？

小溪：这篇文章，来自一位花友的大力推荐，感谢花友@BBBZ

这其实是一个来自知乎热门问题“排名前1%的高中生，靠的是天赋还是靠努力？“下的最高赞回答。

帖子作者，自己在高中时就曾排名前1%，目前量子计算博士在读。他在回答里剖析了学霸背后的深层学习逻辑，收到了13.4万人赞同、20多万人收藏、过5000评论，热度值巨高。

作者在分析学习底层逻辑之外，尤其讲到父母在其中的关键影响，相当于在回答：高中前1%的孩子，有哪些决定性的特质，来自父母从小到大的培养？回帖中有人说：看了后醍醐灌顶，要是早十年被父母看到就好了。可见，虽然谈的是高中阶段的问题，但思路对小学和初中娃的家长也有一定参考价值。

今天，我们获得了这位热情知乎网友“edomnd“的授权，和大家分享他的“牛贴”。帖子观点新颖，论证很有密度，读下来需要一点耐心，不过相信会收获满满。推荐哦！

本文由知乎网友@edmond授权发布

--- 以下为正文 ---

关于问题"排名在前 1% 的高中生是靠天赋还是靠努力？"，我的回答是：既不是天赋，也不是努力。

真正起决定性作用的，是在十几年间由成长环境，教育资源，人生轨迹等因素潜移默化形成的「习惯霸权」。

很多人对学习的理解是这样的：

那些天天上课睡觉打游戏然后考前翻翻书，最后九十多分就是天赋高，认真听课挑灯夜战结果最多六七十分就是天赋低。

面对同样的问题，一看秒懂就是天赋高，苦思冥想还一头雾水就是天赋低。

天赋是基因决定的，生而有之，不可逾越，永久保留的。天赋低的人再怎么努力也无法弥补这种差距。天赋是勤奋的功率。

学习观大概是这样的，有一套简单的公式：

成绩=天赋×努力；

天赋=成绩÷努力；

努力=成绩÷天赋

...

这是一种非常肤浅的学习观。

首先亮明，这篇文章将要论证的观点是：

1、天赋的差距是存在的，并且这种差距在学习中的作用也是存在的。

我没有完全否定天赋的重要性。

我没有完全否定天赋的重要性。

我没有完全否定天赋的重要性。

重要的话说三遍！

2、但是，大多数人高估了这种纯天赋的作用的重要性。人们对学习现象下意识的肤浅认知，会导致我们把很多其实源于后天习惯，但比较隐蔽的因素归因于天赋。

我知道很多人会举出一堆自己身边的听说的天才例子来反驳，然后说“智商的差距是存在”的。请注意，我这里论证的不是“差距不存在”，而是“这个差距的重要性被高估了，其中被高估的部分多源于习惯的贡献”。

3、如果我们把学习效率看成一个以天赋，努力，习惯，方法，环境等诸多因素为变量的多元函数：

作者画的一个粗略的示意图，比例可以忽略，不是作者论证的重点

我们对学习规律的洞察力越强，认知越深刻，也就越能探明那些作用隐蔽的习惯来源，在我们的认知中天赋的权重便越小；反之，我们的认知越肤浅，能够解释的因素就越少，就越会把那堆自己解释不了的因素笼统地归因为“天赋”，在我们认知中天赋的权重便越大。

于是，一个人心目中天赋的权重大小，基本上也就反映了其对"学习"这件事的理解深度。

然而可悲的是，在这类问题的很多回答下，许多人认为“能够努力也是一种天赋”，这种自以为聪明的荒谬论点，已经趋于反智了。

现在开始论证。

其实在很多情况下，我们所谓的“天赋”，其实应该叫“伪天赋”才对。

那些让“学神”们用更少的付出得到更好的成绩的因素，可以归结为两类：学习习惯与思维习惯。

这两者的作用是如此广泛，如此隐蔽，以至于渗透到了学习的每一个细节中，体现出来就是一种“天赋”的错觉。

学习习惯有多重要？

一个学习习惯差的人可能在幼年缺乏管教，“放弃枯燥的事物而寻求娱乐”的经验更多，于是神经突触的建立让他习惯于从中获得快感，适应了高刺激的事物；

一个学习习惯好的人可能被教育得好一些，从小适应了枯燥的钢琴舞蹈书法绘画，于是追逐刺激的经验更少，适应了低刺激的事物，更习惯于在枯燥中坚持下去。并且随之而来的好成绩正向激励了这种亲和枯燥的习惯。

于是，同样是刷书遇到枯燥的章节，前者在低刺激的环境中更倾向于走神，花了两小时在随时袭来的走神中走走停停勉强推完了这个坎；

而后者更倾向于专注下去，二十分钟就能推完。并且两人的印象深度天差地别；

同样是上课接受信息，刺激阈值更高的前者，在低刺激的信息流中更容易随时「滑落」至其记忆中高刺激的事物，比如走神想到昨天的游戏或和女神的约会；

而阈值更低的后者，则更容易适应低刺激信息流，从而进入状态。

事后，很多人就会觉得这是天赋，是智商。

一个学习习惯差的人可能在早期生活在一个节奏缓慢的教育环境中，更多地体会了拖延学习来开小差的快感，于是神经突触的建立使其习惯于拖延；

而习惯好的人可能相反，在每一次立即行动后获得了巨大的奖赏，于是这种正向刺激的积累使其养成了毫不拖延的习惯；

—— 于是，同样是上课讲到稍微艰难的点，前者更倾向于打算拖到课后再消化，然后开起了小差，后者则更倾向于直接正面刚，当下解决问题。

结果前者不仅上课的时间完全浪费，课后还要以加倍的时间，以更低的效率消化，造成极其恐怖的时间亏损；

而后者则能在一马平川的课后时间自由地平推进度刷熟练，由此多出三四倍的有效学习时间。

事后，很多人就会觉得这是天赋，是智商。

一个学习习惯差的人可能会在早期缺乏挑战困难的教育，于是更习惯于放弃；

而学习习惯好的人则在一件件坚持后完成的难题中得到成就感，从而更习惯于坚持。

—— 于是，同样是学习中遇到难题，前者可能畏难而放弃，认为没必要研究那么难的问题；而后者则会仔细钻研，然后干掉大BOSS，暴涨一波经验值，在滚雪球的挑战与成就感中达到越来越高的等级。

事后，很多人就会觉得这是天赋，是智商。

学习，本身就是一种积累的过程。很多人误以为学习这个动作只是在积累路程，大错特错。学习也能积累学习的速度——换言之，学习本身是自带微小的加速度的。

越学习，就越适应学习，越在“放纵/学习”的艰难抉择中选择后者，你对后者的突触建立就更强一分，下次选择坚持学习也就不那么痛苦一些。

所以，我一向认为，那些说什么“能够努力也是一种天赋”的，不是思维过于简单，就是在为自己的懒惰找借口。

当然，更不用说学习本身还能让你积累试错经验，改进学习方式了。

以上的论证，仅能证明“后天养成的学习习惯能为学习效率产生巨大贡献”，并不意味着“学习效率高的人一定拥有好的学习习惯”。

我知道很多人会举XXX天天上课吊儿郎当回宿舍就打游戏照样年级前十……等等的例子。所以，接下来就要说到另一种因素——思维习惯。这种因素更重要，也同时更隐蔽。

思维习惯有多重要？

我们在接受一个新的经验或新的理论时，对其的认知往往是依靠其与已知的经验或理论进行的比较与联系。

许多关于学习原理的书都会讲到这一点，并由此强调体系，比喻等等的重要性，但很多人并未真正理解这是怎么回事。

举个经验的例子，我们见到一个由几根木棍支撑的木板，会马上判定这是一张“桌子”，因为我们在后天见到所有具有类似特征的东西，都被我们分类为“桌子”了，于是这一类物品就和“桌子”这个词语联系在一起。即便我们没见过面前这种桌子，但凭借其与这一类事物极其相似的特征，我们可以轻松地对其进行模式识别，认为其也将和这个类别下所有的事物一样，被公认为具备“桌子”的分类。

再举理论的例子，概率论讲到大数定律的章节，一个听说过价格回归价值定律的人可能可以秒懂，一个听说过“路遥知马力，日久见人心”的人可能理解起来会更容易些；学习物理，听说过“强弩之末，不可穿鲁缟”的人，可能更容易理解匀减速直线运动的规律；做过智商测试题的人，往往可以瞬间理解三阶行列式的沙路计算法。

比如一个积累少的人：

一个新的东西进来，他可能很难找到相通的东西：

但如果积累多了：

能够找到链接的概率也就大大增加，体现出来就是一种“熟悉”的感觉：

而对于这种思维习惯的获取，后天教育中一个作用相当大的途径就是阅读习惯的养成。

按照《如何阅读一本书》中的分法，书籍的作用有两种，一是提供经验、二是教授理论。

比如一部小说，就是一系列经过高度整理，高度有序化的经验；一本科普杂志，除了经验之外还有一系列浅显通俗的理论。

一个热爱阅读小说新闻的孩子，在早期可能就通过阅读这种可以最快提升自己经验丰富度的途径，拥有了远超其他同龄人的早期经验积累，而人总有从已有经验归纳理论的倾向。

这个过程好比链式反应里中子的释放一样——物质体积越大，发生中子撞击的可能性也就越大。人的经验越丰富，平时突发灵感从经验归纳出理论/联系的可能性也就越高。面对新知识时也就更容易触类旁通，举一反三。

一个热爱阅读科普杂志或者浅显理论的孩子，则更容易养成锻炼出自己接受外来理论与整理既有经验的习惯。同时一个个由以往经验整理出理论的成功案例很可能会在价值观上激励他们思考，并养成强烈的思考倾向。

你仔细观察那些学习效率高的人，很可能也会发现其小时候或多或少都有爱阅读的习惯。无论是何种阅读，都有产生精神愉悦的可能。而这种愉悦将成为宝贵的早期正向激励，使其爱上吸收外界经验/接受外界理论，或者开始看到一道难题就忍不住思考，忍不住推敲。

细分起来，他们可能也因此爱上数学/物理/天文/历史等等具体的领域。所谓兴趣，很大程度上也是后天的。而兴趣对一个人学习的作用，不言而喻。

然后，你可能会说，许多天才长于逻辑推理或数学计算这些比较先验的东西，这又如何解释？

这里引用 @张英锋的回答：

智商高低是因为思维习惯不同造成的吗？

成年后的高斯说，在他学会说话之前就会计算了。这说明在高斯的幼年经常接触到各种数字，无意间让他很小的年龄就掌握了初等算术。有这样一个有数学应用背景的父亲就是拼爹，但高斯的父亲有个缺点就是目光短浅。

……

通过长期高强度的数学计算，高斯不仅计算能力极强，而且非常善于发明数学工具，来简化自己的计算过程。刚才说到高斯9岁时就掌握了等差数列的速算方法，他在18岁时又发明了最小二乘法，极大简化了计算过程。后来，勒让德在54岁时也发明了最小二乘法，并早于高斯发表，获得了优先权，但这个工具高斯已经用了十几年。

但是没有公开！

有人曾估算，如果高斯当时能及时发表他的研究成果，整个高等数学可以向前推进50年！但高斯是个完美主义者，他拒绝发布不完整和有瑕疵的作品。他的很多成果都来自内在视觉洞察力，是直觉形式的结论，虽然他自己长期使用，已被验证没有问题，但并没有经过逻辑严密的证明。而高斯跑的太快，完全不想停下来，把宝贵的时间消耗到琐碎无比的严密证明上。如果高等数学真的因此被推迟了50年，这可真是整个科学界不可估量的巨大损失！

我前面说道，数学家可以不借助纸笔来思考数学问题，这其实来源于他们高强度的数学计算，高斯是这方面的佼佼者。可能很多人会好奇，高斯的计算强度究竟有多大？我们以1818年高斯担任丹麦的测地工作为例，整个工作持续了8年，高斯白天测绘，晚上计算，他曾估计测绘所画的图就有100多万张。野外实测数据汇总后，全部计算工作由高斯负责，随便两个点都是用最小二乘法通过冗长的计算获得，一般需要一个计算能力中等的人计算2～3天才能算完，共有3000多个坐标点，总计算量需要这个人一天不休的计算10年！

也就是说，即使是逻辑推理与数学直觉这种东西，也是可以通过后天的思维训练锻炼的。

比如说，同样解决一道难题/理解一个难的概念，需要经过至少七层嵌套的逻辑。

于是，一个经过高度逻辑训练的人，可能前三层逻辑早已烂熟于心，第四五层逻辑又在他以前做过的题目/看过的书中熟悉过，剩下的工作只不过是推出剩下的两层逻辑而已；

而一个没经过高度逻辑训练的人，可能只能熟悉前两层的逻辑，于是要解决这个问题，他可能就要占用极大的工作记忆空间，经历无数次试错，承受大量不熟悉逻辑的痛苦，才能HOLD住那高达五层的逻辑树。于是解不出来就是很正常的事了。

体现出来的现象，就是很多人做不出来题目，事后发现原因都是「想不到」。

我们每做一道题目，每理解一个概念，每尝试一次思考，就是在不断地熟悉其内容底下的一个个逻辑通路，对其的神经链接不断地变得畅通。

而对这种逻辑通路的熟悉，会迁移到我们未来遇到具有类似底层逻辑的问题中去，从而举一反三。换言之，做题好处的本质，就是熟悉逻辑范式，缩小推理的“可能性空间”，从而让自己的逻辑习惯能更好地拟合实际问题的路径。

然而，事后，仍然有很多人会觉得这是天赋，是智商。

当然，你的确可以举例来反驳我说某神思维习惯并不突出/某神阅读量其实稀少/某神拖延癌/某神天天追求刺激等等。但是，以上所列出的每一个具体习惯，都只是包括了习惯，天赋，努力，环境，经历，方法等诸多因素的因素集合之一，一个人可能只需要十中得五已经很了不起了，十中得七八的“天才”也会有二三短板。但总的来说，最根本性决定学习效率的，仍是后天习惯。

中心极限定理告诉我们，由大量独立因素影响的变量将近似服从高斯分布，学生的成绩也应如此（虽然这些因素并非绝对独立，但也可以近似为高斯分布）——无数各异的从小到大的一个个习惯，积累下的一点点经验，纷繁复杂的成长环境，人尽不同的个人经历，高低不平的天赋和主观能动性，上上下下地分布在每一个学生身上。

北京海淀区2023年的中考成绩分布图

而那些排在前1%的学生，或是在天赋上突出，或是在习惯上突出，或是方法努力等突出，又或者平均而都不错。而在这个分布中最右端的那些人，往往在所有变量上都至少做到了“优秀”这个层次。

我知道，很多人会反驳说，你到最好的学校去观察那些成绩拔尖的学生，一定能发现他们的天赋都很高——所以得出结论，到了最顶尖的水平，只能拼天赋。换句话说，就是流传得很广的所谓「努力决定下限，天赋决定上限」。

但是你要明白，在无数个变量产生的高斯分布中，越往极端靠近，短板效应就越严重。不仅仅是天赋，那些最靠前的学生，你观察他们的习惯，同样也会发现他们的习惯都很好；观察他们的努力，同样也会发现他们都付出了很多。在最顶尖的位置，习惯，天赋，努力，方法等已经是缺一不可。此时所有的高权重因素基本都会成为必要条件，天赋在其间并无什么不同之处。

我曾经认识一个高考省状元，她身上就集成了顶尖的天赋，强大的规划能力，最优秀的教育资源，从小刻苦的才艺训练，对特定学科的热爱，每天精确6小时整睡眠的作息等优秀的因素，才有了最顶尖的成绩。

所以说，所谓「天赋决定上限，努力决定下限」也是不准确的，所有的因素共同决定上下限。

所以，智商带来的作用就不存在了吗？

不是的。

前面大约提到，我们学习的途径本质上分两种，一是从外界表象获取新的经验，二是从既有的经验与理论中整理归纳出新的规律与理论，或者外界协助你完成这个过程。

记得在知乎上看到过一张形象介绍DIKW体系的图，搬运一下：

而我们最最普通的智商测试一般长这样：

（别问了，答案就是D）

也就是说，这些网上流传的智力测验，是在测试你从给定有限的经验中归纳出规律与理论的能力（所以智力测验声称跨文化，是因为其剥离了既有经验的因素），对应的是第二种。

这种能力的确重要，比如数学上有一个段子：

数学家能找到定理之间的相似之处；

优秀的数学家能看到证明之间的相似之处；

卓越的数学家能察觉到数学分支之间的相似之处；

最后，究级的数学家能俯瞰这些相似之处之间的相似之处。

这里主要涉及到的就是归纳能力的强弱；另外还有更专业的测试，可以测出工作记忆，反应速度等等。

所以说，智商带来的能力差距是存在的。

但是，你的归纳能力再高，也抵不上爱阅读的孩子积累下可观的经验与理论存量；

但是，你的反应速度再快，也抵不上意志强的孩子听课从不走神的耐力；

但是，你的工作记忆再强，也抵不上家教好的孩子轻易专注两个小时的好习惯；

如果你告诉我一个985的学霸在天赋，对学习的理解与勤奋度上甚至都不如一个普通二本的学渣，我一点也不会觉得意外。这两个人之间差距的最大原因在于他们从小受到的教育，环境带来的习惯。

这篇文章，不是来给你灌鸡汤的。我要告诉你的是：

学习习惯与思维习惯，是另一种形式的“阶级固化”。

这种阶级固化，就像一道道坚固的高墙，

在从小的钢琴绘画与电子游戏之间，

在一本本数理启蒙文学名著与网络爽文无脑漫画之间，

在巧妙的引导鼓励与粗暴的填鸭灌输之间，

在科学的言传身教与无度的溺爱家暴之间，

在周游世界博览群书和无所事事游手好闲之间，

在从小热爱推理痴迷编程与热爱游戏痴迷逛街之间，

在一贯的三好学生与起起落落的吊儿郎当之间，

在竞赛班的灯火通明与普通班的嘻哈玩乐之间，悄然建立。

等你发觉这一切之时，高耸在普通人和学霸学神之间的，已是一道道无形而万难贯穿的，名为「习惯霸权」的壁垒。

尔后，他们享受了最好的教育资源和引导，最优秀的学习习惯和思维习惯渗入了他们的骨髓，融入了他们的血液，七岁的某个教训中养成的专注学习心无旁骛的习惯，九岁的某次接触中种下的对某领域兴趣的种子，十二岁的某次引导中建立的超前自学的意识，十五岁的竞赛训练中积累的无数精微的底层思维方法——开始隐蔽地化入了他们学习的每一个底层细节中，变得行云流水一般自然。

这时，完成了习惯的原始积累的他们，便可以顶着「天赋异禀」「兴趣广泛」「视野开阔」「思维活跃」「潜心钻研」「博览群书」等等的光环，获得不用花费多大努力也能轻松学好的特权，成为又优秀又会玩的“后浪”。

而习惯糟糕的孩子，今天就算竭力地想学好一门科目，也不得不跨过这样的难关——习惯中对高刺激的适应让你在枯燥的内容面前永远无法集中精力，习惯中对难题的回避让你对一切复杂的概念本能地排斥，习惯中对任务的拖延让你在ddl到来之前永远心存侥幸。

开始拼命地给自己喊口号，开始用网上的各种方法各种技巧，开始把自己关在图书馆里天天发朋友圈打卡，然后效率仍然不及别人的十分之一。

而这时，就会有无数诸如——「你不过是感动自己的努力婊而已」「用那些方法都是虚的去干不就行了吗」「承认吧这就是智商的差距」「其实能够努力也是一种天赋」「不要用战术上的勤奋掩盖战略上的懒惰」这样的声音，落到孩子的头上。

没有人能看到这些表象背后的，通过习惯霸权建立起来的的本质。

很多天赋论者以为，我反对天赋决定论，就是在逃避现实，灌输心灵鸡汤，主张“我只是不努力而已只要我努力就能超过他们”。

错了。

普通人和"学神"的差距有多大，这道「习惯壁垒」就有多难击穿。击穿这个壁垒，是相当于小说中「逆天改命」这个级别的事情。

习惯的作用是如此的隐蔽，以至于弥散渗透在了学习生活的每一个细节当中，控制着你绝大部分的学习行为，而又隐蔽得让不善思考的人不得不将其归因为“天赋”这个笼统的概念。

毕竟，最让人痛苦的，不是“我不行”，而是“我本可以”。

于是当下学生社会中，便流行着一种“鄙视链”的风气：我们不谈对知识的热爱，不谈对学习的坚持——却偏偏要攀比成绩除以努力的那个商数是高还是低，然后拿来排出一二三四，论出甲乙丙丁。

一个人努力学习而成绩一般，那便最该鄙视；倘若成绩不错，那倒正常，位列次席；万一这人成绩不错时还能坚持天天打游戏，那就更要奉为至高无上的大神了。

这是一种何其病态的风气。

既然说到了这里，顺带说一件事情。其实这篇文章里举的所有坏习惯的例子，所有习惯糟糕的人设，说的都是答主我自己。

我以前接受过专业的智力测验，也有比较高的得分。我也的确有很多高智商带来的学习体验——比如一旦专注于某个问题，就会有源源不断的灵感和极快的思维速度，在状态最好的时候，我甚至试过发课本的那天一天看完一本理工科教材。和老师讨论问题，我也几乎可以一直用最高效的交流路径最快地缩小可能性空间，然后很快解决问题。

但是，也只有这样，我才能更深切的体会到，这一点点小聪明的作用，在深层渗透得无孔不入的种种习惯面前，真的是杯水车薪。

你明明专注起来可以一天看完一本书，但你就是专注不起来，你明明稍微集中一下精力就能摧枯拉朽地理解面前所有难懂的概念，但你在那些枯燥的文字面前，就是集中不了精力——最后落得一个不上不下的成绩。

觉得无法理解对不对？我也觉得无法理解。

甚至，我在观念上还算是非常重视学习的，甚至我在十几年的时间里，都在用所有的意志和自己的坏习惯搏斗。但在最后，也只是勉强进入1%，勉强符合这道题的区间。我也算是一个习惯极差的样本吧。

最后声明：我并不是心理学，教育学等相关领域的专业人士，以上内容也仅仅来源于一个普通的大二学生（编辑注：目前博士在读）对日常生活现象的观察和反思，抛砖引玉，只作一个参考。

如果想获得更专业的见解，可以阅读相关的书籍或关注相关专业人士。如有不当之处，也还请专业人士指出，诚惶诚恐，不胜感激。

# 探讨高中生排名前1%背后的秘密：天赋、努力还是其他因素？_成绩_优势_学业


                        由内容质量、互动评论、分享传播等多维度分值决定，勋章级别越高(
                        
                        )，代表其在平台内的综合表现越好。
                    

近年来，围绕高中生的竞争压力与成功之路展开了许多讨论。其中一个最为关键的问题就是：排名在前1%的高中生是靠天赋还是靠努力？



首先，我们需要明确一个概念：天赋并非是一个人一生的全部。尽管有天赋的人在某些领域或任务上比其他人更具优势，但他们也需要经过不断努力才能够真正发挥出自己的能力。因此，在考虑这个问题时，我们不能简单地将“天赋”与“努力”二分。



然而，通过调查可以发现，排名在前1%的高中生不可避免地拥有一定的天赋优势。他们可能在学习速度、记忆力、智力等方面具备某些优势，这使得他们在学业上取得更好的成绩。但是，对于他们而言，这并不是决定性的因素。

真正决定一个高中生能否成为排名前1%的学生的是他们付出的努力。这些学生通常会付出大量的时间和努力来提高自己的学术成绩。他们常常花费数小时阅读书籍、做题、参加辅导班、参与学术竞赛等活动。在学习上投入越多，他们的成绩也就越好。



另外，还有一些因素也对于取得高成绩至关重要。例如，一个良好的学习环境、支持性的家庭和教师、以及有效的学习策略等等。这些因素可以促进学生的学习和成长，帮助他们在学业上更进一步。

因此，排名在前1%的高中生的成功之路从来不是靠天赋单打独斗的。只有通过不懈的努力、积极的学习和恰当的支持，他们才能在学业上取得如此卓越的成绩。



这也给我们提供了一些启示。无论我们拥有怎样的天赋，只有通过不断的努力才能实现自己的梦想。如果我们想要取得更好的成绩或者提高自己在某个领域的水平，那么我们需要付出更多的时间和努力，并且获得良好的支持。只有这样，我们才可能成为真正的成功者。

# 20个有趣的杭州小众地方 - 杭州本地宝

【导语】：杭州有什么好玩的地方？杭州除了一些著名的旅游景点之外，还有很多可能不太被关注的杭州小众地方，下面跟着小编一起来看看这些地方的独特之处吧！

　　1.西溪



　　西溪湿地

　　一部非诚勿扰拍红了北海道，也让人知道了西溪。但是大部分的游客来杭还是会选择去西湖，所以西溪会显得更安静。可以闲步逛逛福堤，绿堤和寿堤。杭州就是座很文艺的城市，连景点的名字都起得这么好听。福堤上的蒋村集市会让你感觉来到了丽江。

　　2.杭州最后一辆绿皮火车



　　杭州最后的绿皮火车

　　这辆1997年开通的绿皮车是供铁路员工上下班的专列，只有7节车厢，每天只开2个来回：早上7点10分、下午2点35分，从南星桥始发，途经城站、望江门、艮山门、乔司站，大概有一个小时车程。没有空调广播，没有窗帘，没有装满食品的手推车……火车以前是收费的，你能收到1.8元的手写火车票。可是后来免费了，所以这成了一趟免费的火车专旅。选择一个下午，带上相机，乘上这列绿皮车，和列车员闲谈几句或是自个拍张照，也不错!

　　3.馒头山社区



　　馒头山社区

　　这个社区的名字是不是很可爱啊?馒头山社区位于凤凰山脚下，在这里你可以找到老杭州的感觉。密集的老房子，站在你家的阳台能望到他家的屋顶。人们三三两两坐在家门口纳凉;妇人们抱着孩子，摇着蒲扇;男人们打着赤膊在喝啤酒;而皮肤黝黑的少年，则在台球桌上挥洒汗水。如果正好适逢中午，你可以挑一家面馆，尝试下坐在路边吃饭的感觉。面店的老板娘都快把桌子摆到路中央去了。对了，这里还有所杭州市美术职业学校，那可是汤唯的母校呢。

　　4.太子湾



　　太子湾

　　太子湾不用多说了，现在应该是郁金香的海洋了吧。还有樱花。我喜欢杭州的原因之一：她的很多地方都免费，还有自行车出租，对于杭州，和两三个好朋友骑着脚踏车，在西湖一带，停停走走，都是景。

# 杭州有很多清幽的小众景点，避开人群！-携程攻略


=================https://www.sohu.com/a/458709649_100010744=========================

# 藏在西湖边的3个小众景点，人少风景美，杭州本地人都不一定知道_乌龟潭


                        由内容质量、互动评论、分享传播等多维度分值决定，勋章级别越高(
                        
                        )，代表其在平台内的综合表现越好。
                    

每年春天几乎都要去一趟杭州，在我心里，春雨朦胧中的杭州，几乎就是江南的代名词，彰显出温润气韵。

当成千上万的游人都涌向西湖、龙井踏青时，我开始致力于寻找杭州非热门旅行地。这些地方有的沾染了西湖的灵气，有的比灵隐寺更具有禅意，就算节假日也依然静谧。



趁着春暖花开的日子，推荐3个我曾去过的宝藏景点。也许你去过，也许你路过很多次却不曾深入了解，那么就跟我一起去发现它们的细微之美吧。

乌龟潭

初听乌龟潭的名字，并不觉得很有美感，甚至问杭州本地人，他们都会想想到底在哪里。这处隐秘的角落匿藏在西湖景区深处，位于花港西门与于谦祠之间，顺着杨公堤走走即可到达，据说因潭边的山形状像乌龟而得名。



要说乌龟潭有什么特别之处，那就是静谧和湿地，当一堤之隔的花港游人如织时，来乌龟潭却能静静赏花游湖。湿地风光，为乌龟潭所独有，它又将西湖的山清水秀巧妙融合进来，辅以亭台楼榭和木曲桥，俨然一个微缩版的“小西湖”。



于谦祠前种满了白色晚樱，4月初开得刚刚好。沿着乌龟潭走一圈，红色杜鹃、紫藤、雪柳、海棠等各种春花交相辉映，衬着绿幽幽的潭水，想怎么拍怎么拍。偶尔遇见湖中摇船的工作人员，不经意入镜却成了画中的一部分。





乌龟潭的一角，有一个小瀑布，另一角则有一座石桥，这座古桥是从桐庐按原貌拆迁过来，尽管都是小小景致却颇具灵气。在潭边随意找张长椅，倚着感受徐徐春光，或者打开一本书默读，一天的时光就慢慢过去了。



法镜寺

杭州寺庙文化源远流长，最盛名在外的要数灵隐寺。若要追求更为宁静的礼佛之地，西湖古刹天竺三寺值得参拜。漫走在天竺路上，犹如踏上一条朝圣之路，浓密的参天古木，鹅黄色寺庙若隐若现，蜿蜒台阶拾级而上，清幽至极。



清高宗乾隆为这里的上、中、下三竺分别命名为法喜寺、法净寺、法镜寺，并亲题寺额。三寺相距不过近千米，其中又以法镜寺最为小众，它在三竺寺中历史最悠久，也是杭州唯一的女众寺庙。



快要到下三竺时，偶尔邂逅一两个僧人，这也意味着法镜寺到了。它地处著名的飞来峰和月桂峰之间，又与灵隐寺遥遥相望，地理位置可以说非常有灵气了。院落虽不大，亭台楼阁却建造得颇为用心，看起来小巧秀气，很适合女僧人在此修行。于其中走走，心情也跟着愉悦起来。



特别值得一提的是位于院内的药师殿以及莲花峰东麓的三生石。药师殿里供奉的药师如来坛是按《药师经》仪规设计而成，乃国内仅有。三生石则在林俊杰《江南》里被提到，“缘分就在三生石上面”，最初却是友谊的象征。



小牙坞

来过杭州西湖的人大都知道梅家坞，“十里梅坞，风景如画”，来600多年历史的梅家坞喝正宗龙井茶，吃顿农家饭，看看西湖风景，三种美事兼得。

不过由于来的游人太多，总会把梅岭南路堵得水泄不通。我更偏爱离梅家坞约两三公里路程的小牙坞，这里几乎看不到游客，可以肆意在茶田穿梭，静心体验杭州独有的茶文化。



说小牙坞是西湖边最小的村子，它的确很小，全村总共十多户人家，全部沿山而建。跟梅家坞一样，小牙坞的村民也大都经营农家乐，由于地理位置相对偏僻，他们都做熟客的生意，我可能是一个例外。杭帮菜和正宗龙井在这里都能找到，河虾、白鲢、腌笃鲜等，老板总会质朴地按照人数推荐，基本不会浪费。



吃完饭后顺着小径去爬山，两旁都是茶园，而且地势平缓。极目远眺，所及之处全是绿意，也没有蜂拥的游客来破坏意境，颇有些独享醉人春色的意味。继续往山上走，左边为十里琅珰和云栖竹径，右边为龙井村，向左走非常适合徒步，路两边山泉水潺潺流过，竹子新抽嫩芽，徜徉其中，总忍住到处拍拍。

                        由内容质量、互动评论、分享传播等多维度分值决定，勋章级别越高(
                        
                        )，代表其在平台内的综合表现越好。
                    

一年一度的国庆假期又要来了，相信大家都已经迫不及待，那么该如何利用好假期呢？下面汇总了浙江省几个小众游玩景点，让你不再局限于人山人海的旅游模式，体会全身心的放松，尽情享受假期！

显然，杭州是旅游热门城市，“上有天堂，下有苏杭”，这句话牵引着一个个旅游爱好者的心，而且杭州的旅游不分淡旺季，每逢假期西湖人多到走不动路，十分影响心情，相比之下，位于西湖西边群山中的九溪更值得一去，九溪，北接龙井，流入钱江，这一带山谷幽深，林木茂密，秋天到处是漫天遍野的红枫，溪涧众多，茶园散处，晴天秀色可餐，阴雨时烟云飘逸，有小径曲屈，峰峦夹峙，涧泉峥淙，篁楠交翠的胜景。



徐凫岩景点位于宁波市奉化区溪口镇，是众多5A景点中最低调的存在，徐凫岩在国庆人海中是较为悠闲的清流之地，高山流水、大气氧吧，桂花飘香，在这里轻松露个营，简直不要太爽！

徐凫岩最受欢迎的户外项目是飞拉达，在海拔200米的悬崖壁上，踩着随风摇摆的钢丝，体验绝壁生路，看似惊险万分，实则有三根安全绳保护还有随身教练陪同，安全系数还是比较高的。



南浔古镇，是一个人文资源充足、中西建筑合璧的江南古镇，素有“文化之邦”和“诗书之乡”之称。南浔古镇景区面积2.18平方公里，共分三大区块，第一块是南浔旅游景点富集区，张石铭故居、刘氏梯号等景点分布其中；第二块是由小莲庄、嘉业堂藏书楼等景点组成的中心景区；第三块是以东大街、张静江故居和百间楼为主的东北区块，镇内众多的名胜古迹与水乡自然风光和谐统一，既充满着浓郁的历史文化底蕴和灵气，又洋溢着江南水乡诗画一般的袖韵。



位于兰溪市区东郊8公里处的六洞山风景区是浙江省中西部旅游线上的一颗明珠，以山美、水秀、洞奇、寺幽为特色，以溶洞景观为主，由涌雪洞-玉露洞、佳果游赏、栖真寺、江山一揽四大景区组成。



位于丽水市云和县崇头镇的云和梯田被誉为“中国最美梯田”之一，蜿蜒迂回、连绵不断的层层阶梯，是古代劳动人民智慧的结晶，这里的日出云海景观十分震撼，值得一看！



位于浙江舟山嵊泗县的枸杞岛由于多生产枸杞而得名，岛上重重叠叠的房子好似镶嵌在山崖上，像是一座海上的“布达拉宫”。



北麂岛位于瑞安东山街道，相比于比较火热的南麂岛，北麂岛显得更加纯朴和小众，这里有极具艺术感的民居建筑、登山看日出和傍晚看日落，还可以在海边散步或搭帐篷也是非常潮流的活动，北麂山灯塔也是不错的打卡点。



覆危山景区地处上虞、州、余姚三市 (区)交界地带，这里山清水秀、空气清新优雅恬静，是都市人回归自然，享受田园美景的“世外桃源”。覆危山景区旅游资源类型丰富，以冰川石浪、千年梯田、百年古村、上虞第高峰、“四季仙果”之旅樱桃基地等优质旅游资源最为突出。



大明山风景名胜区位于浙江省杭州市临安区西部顺溪镇，景区以大明山为主体，多奇峰怪石、溪涧飞瀑，是一个以良好的生态环境为基础，以悬崖峰林、峡谷飞瀑、高山原野为景观特色集观光游览、避暑度假、生态养生功能于一体的山水观光型景点。



希望在即将到来的国庆假期里，更多的人能够走出人流云集的热门景区，前往这些宝藏般的小众景点，发现更多惊喜和感动，以上小众景点你去过吗？欢迎评论区留言分享返回搜狐，查看更多

# 苗大东：京东基于强化学习的电商搜索排序算法 - DataFunTalk - 博客园



导读： 电商场景的搜索排序算法根据用户搜索请求，经过召回、粗排、精排、重排与混排等模块将最终的结果呈现给用户，算法的优化目标是提升用户转化。传统的有监督训练方式，每一步迭代的过程中优化当前排序结果的即时反馈收益。但是，实际上用户和搜索系统之间不断交互，用户状态也在不断变化，每一次交互后排序结果和用户反馈也会对后续排序产生影响。因此，我们通过强化学习来建模用户和搜索系统之间的交互过程，优化长期累积收益。目前这个工作已经在京东全量上线。

今天的介绍会围绕下面五点展开：

--

首先和大家分享下搜索排序的典型场景以及常用的算法。



搜索排序场景下的主要优化目标是提升用户转化率，常用的算法分别从用户建模角度（DIN、DIEN、Memory Network等）和多目标建模角度（ESMM、MOE、MMOE等）进行设计。这些模型都采用了有监督的训练方式，在每一步迭代的过程中都是优化当前排序结果的即时奖励。而实际上用户和搜索系统之间存在交互，用户状态是不断改变的，这也使得每一步排序结果和反馈跟后续排序有相关性。为了提升搜索精排的效率，我们使用强化学习来建模用户和搜索系统之间的交互过程，并且考虑对后续排序结果影响带来的长期价值。

--



我们的工作经过整理后发表在2021CIKM上，接下来介绍的算法也主要与这篇论文相关。



首先介绍强化学习在搜索排序中的建模。强化学习的优化目标是长期价值的期望最大化。如上图公式中所示，长期价值期望Q是在一个状态下，执行一个动作后，当前时刻的即时奖励和后续时刻带来的累积折损奖励之和。它和有监督学习的最主要区别在于后者通常优化当前决策带来的即时收益，而强化学习是去优化决策的长期价值。

在搜索场景下强化学习的建模过程如上图所示，当用户（即强化学习中的environment）发起一次搜索请求时，我们的排序引擎会基于当前用户的状态，选取一个排序动作（排序动作即为对候选商品进行打分）并将排序结果呈现给用户。用户在看到排序结果后会做出一系列反馈，如下单或者点击。此时，用户的状态会发生变化，排序模块会收到用户的反馈（即奖励）。排序模块收到奖励之后会对策略进行迭代优化，进而在收到下一次用户请求时会基于新的用户状态和排序策略进行下一步动作的执行。

基于上述完整算法流程，我们需要对用户状态进行建模，并且对排序策略建模优化长期价值。强化学习的建模思路主要依照其四要素：状态、动作、奖励的设计以及算法的选择。在业界对于强化学习在搜索排序的应用也有一些研究，我们主要参考了阿里巴巴的一篇论文以及2019年YouTube强化学习在推荐中的应用的论文。但是，经过一些实验后，我们最终的方案和业界还是存在比较大的差异。



首先，阿里的那篇文章是建模用户在单次搜索中多次翻页情况下的序列决策过程，即当用户在一次请求后，模型会考虑当前页的及时反馈以及后续翻页后反馈带来的影响，对应的优化目标是用户单次搜索多次翻页的场景价值。而我们的方案进一步考虑了用户多次搜索的决策过程，因为用户在发生购买行为前会经过一系列搜索决策。具体地，我们会考虑用户在本次搜索结果的即时奖励以及对后续搜索结果影响的长期价值，对应的优化目标是用户在整个搜索决策过程中的长期价值。结合具体的建模过程以及工业界落地的时候针对时效性的考虑，我们的技术路线主要包括两个方面：

--



我们线上的baseline是一个基于DIN的模型， 建模目标商品与用户历史行为序列中商品的关系，从而对用户的状态进行表征。但是我们还希望序列化建模用户的状态变化，这是DIN无法实现的。与此同时，线上的用户状态也在实时不断地变化更新，所以我们需要通过一种方式实时捕捉线上的反馈，并对用户状态的变化做一个表征。具体解决方案分为三个方面：

数据层面：用户搜索query的时序数据；

模型层面：选择RNN来建模用户的状态转移；

架构层面：因为涉及到用户在线的状态更新，所以会有加入用户状态实时增量更新的一个通路。

1. 数据层面



在数据层面，通常来说，训练样本的构造方式是用户在某次搜索下的所有商品，并进行展开，如上图左下所示，这些样本就成为传统有监督学习的训练数据。为了把用户的搜索数据进行时序展开，我们进行了两步操作：

首先，我们会把用户在一个搜索session下所有的曝光商品结合在一起（无序的）；然后，用户的搜索session会按照时间进行排序，并将其放入用户索引下。

在样本输入模型之前我们需要对其进行转化。比如在训练RNN模型时，输入的batch size即为用户数量，在RNN每一个time step输入用户的一个session（即用户的一次请求），其中包含请求中所有商品的特征。

2. 模型层面



为了兼容baseline的DIN模型，我们将DIN生成的特征作为attention feature加入模型。在每一个timestep，用户对应session下的所有商品特征会经过一个GRU，得到每个商品的输出向量以及隐状态向量，而隐状态向量会与下一个timestep的session特征一起作为新的输入传递进GRU，并对GRU进行状态更新。在这个过程中，用户当前时刻的状态依赖于上一时刻的状态以及当前时刻的输入，因此它是一个序列化建模的过程。



但是，实际在模型训练时，我们需要考虑到用户搜索数量的差异。具体地，某个用户可能有上百次搜索请求，而其他用户只有几十个甚至几个请求。训练RNN时为了保证输入长度的一致我们会加入padding，搜索请求数量的巨大差异导致不必要的开销，对RNN的性能产生影响。基于这一问题，我们会将搜索长度较短的用户进行筛选并进行拼接，进而减少不必要的padding。经过实验，优化后的RNN训练效率提升了约三倍。

3. 架构层面



针对用户状态的实时增量更新，我们使用的架构可以分为三个模块，并针对目标进行对应的优化。



我们使用RNN用户状态转移建模对精排进行了全量更新。离线情况下session的AUC@10相较于基于Attention机制的baseline模型提升了0.58%。在线AB实验后，在用户的转化率以及每个用户带来的GMV上也分别有显著的提升。

--



我们想通过强化学习来建模用户和搜索系统之间的交互，在整体上优化长期累积收益。在具体落地时，算法需要根据动作设计、状态设计、奖励设计、算法选择来分为多个阶段：

首先我们基于搜索任务设计动作空间，然后基于用户的搜索行为使用前述的RNN模型进行状态建模，接着我们会基于搜索排序的优化目标设计奖励，最后基于整个策略迭代的收敛性和稳定性选择相应的学习算法。



首先，考虑长期收益的优势在于它纳入了后续筛选带来的累积收益，而有监督学习的每一步都是在优化特征与转化label之间的直接关系。对于动作设计，由于我们面对的是一个排序任务，所以动作即为对候选商品的打分。我们在模型训练阶段选择了pairwise的训练方式，所以我们需要对输入样本的形式进行一些改动。具体地，我们会从用户的每个session中把每一个正样本保留下来，并对应地随机采样一个负样本，从而形成一个样本对。对应地，在训练过程中动作便转化为对构造的正负样本对进行打分。



由于我们采用pairwise的训练方式，我们采用的奖励函数是根据正负样本的分差进行构建的。我们的优化目标是用户转化率，所以我们希望在模型对正负样本对进行打分时，不仅排序可以正确，而且正样本与负样本的分差尽可能大。所以，奖励函数设计时，如果正样本和负样本排序正确时，分差越大奖励越大；反之，我们希望分差越大乘法也越大。上图中我们给出了三种奖励函数的设计：常数reward、交叉熵reward以及sigmoidreward。



我们对这些reward做了一些实验。常数reward在我们的场景下指标一直是振荡的，收敛性比较差，主要原因是只要模型打分顺序正确，它给予的都是固定的奖励，这就导致了若两个商品打分分别为0.51与0.49，虽然它们的区分度不高，但是奖励与其他样本对是一致的。

此外，在比较交叉熵reward以及sigmoid reward时，我们发现交叉熵reward一直是一个负值，而具有正值收益的sigmoid reward相较于前者有了0.16%的指标提升。



强化学习的根本任务是智能体基于环境状态和交互反馈，学习能让长期价值最大化的策略。一般地，有三种方法进行建模：

我们在线上分别对这第一、第三种方式进行过实验，最后发现Actor-critic的建模方法效果较好，于是选择使用这种框架进行算法迭代。



现在就来具体介绍一下DDPG的网络结构。整个网络包含三个模块：

整个网络设计了两种损失函数。第一个为PolicyGradient的损失函数，它的作用是优化Actor网络的参数，使得其输出的action的长期价值最大；另一个为时间差分的损失函数，作用是优化Critic网络，使得其可以对Actor输出的动作给出的长期价值的评估越来越准。

在网络训练过程中我们也遇到了很多难点，其中最重要也是最常见的问题便是稳定性和收敛性问题。我们最终给出的具体解决方案是使用连续型的reward函数以及采用损失函数融合的方法。Loss的融合最直接的方式是将Policy Gradient的loss和时间差分loss进行加权求和。我们通过实验发现随着loss weight的增加，我们的指标也有上升的趋势。值得注意的是，当权重等于0或1时，模型都是不收敛的，这也证明了单独使用Policy Gradient损失或者时间差分损失进行模型优化是无法满足模型的稳定性与收敛性的。

另外，我们也尝试增加了一些有监督的辅助损失函数，其也会对指标带来一定的提升。



DDPG在离线指标上相较于RNN模型在Session AUC@10上有了0.83%的提升，在线AB实验指标如用户转化率以及GMV也均有大于1个点的显著提升。

目前DDPG也在搜索精排中进行了一次全量更新。其实大家也会很担心DDPG在线上的稳定性问题，我们对此也做了很多分析。

首先，我们对比了两周的线上指标（后续其实观察了更长时间），发现DDPG在上线初期指标出现震荡，但是模型稳定之后其指标持续优于RNN模型，证明了算法的稳定性。

另外，我们考虑了不同用户分组上的评测指标，例如将用户按照他的历史搜索次数进行筛选和分组。实验发现，DDPG在用户历史搜索越多时，其对长期价值的建模越准确。这在使用新老用户进行分组实验时也体现了相似的结论，与我们的建模预期吻合。

首先，在技术方面，因为我们一开始强化学习的模型并没有在线上使用online learning，所以刚开始迭代的时候模型还是进行离线更新。目前我们online learning的技术已经全量上线了，后续会做一些更复杂的探索，为on-policy的强化学习算法奠定基础。采用on-policy强化学习算法能够更加实时捕捉用户反馈，不断地进行策略的更新。

另一方面，在业务层面，京东主站商品和LBS商品（小时购）部署的排序模块是两个独立模型。那么如何对这两种类型的商品进行混排来达到整体收益最大化是我们想要探索的目标。

--

Q1：Dump feature中包含什么内容？

A：首先，dump feature包含用户在此次请求时模型使用到的所有商品特征；此外，RNN模型生成的hidden state也会一起加入dump feature中，为后续RNN状态在线增量更新做准备。

Q2：请问有没有尝试过offline强化学习的方法？

A：其实刚才介绍的模型就是一个offline RL的方法。我们的模型会使用历史上一段时间的数据，在训练时我们先离线地使模型达到收敛状态，再将其推至线上进行服务。模型一般一天更新一次，所以在一天之内模型的参数是不变的，但是用户的状态向量会做不断的增量更新。

Q3：请问模型是使用什么方式进行部署的，性能怎么样？

A：其实这是我们京东内部模型部署的一个架构，我们称其为Predictor。在正常情况下，我们模型导出之后会有一些验分的流程，之后会将其推送至Predictor进行线上部署。针对性能的话，虽然在线上有RNN模块，但是我们已经把使用用户历史的搜索计算出的用户状态保存下来并作为RNN的初始状态，所以每一步RNN前向计算都是一个增量计算的过程，对性能没有特别大的影响。

Q4：请问我们的环境是静态数据吗？如果是静态数据，怎么做探索？

A：在训练的过程中，环境是一个静态数据，我们使用用户的历史session，通过RNN不断地学习下一个session的状态。在线服务时，当模型有了初始状态之后，在线环境会给予它实时反馈，进而做在线的更新。

Q5：请问有没有考虑过listwise的排序方法？

A：Listwise排序更多地会用在有监督学习中。在我们强化学习的建模中，我们除了考虑当前的即时奖励之外还会考虑后续的长期价值。但是，我们并没有在用户当前搜索下考虑商品与商品之间的关系， session内样本构造还是一个pairwise的方法。

Q6：请问为什么会设计这种连续的reward函数？

A：这和我们动作的设计有关。我们的动作是对候选商品的排序打分，这是一个连续的动作空间。另外，我们的目标是输出排序动作后，模型对正负样本存在一定的区分性，即在排序正确的情况下得分相差越多，奖励越高。此外，如果给予打分接近、没有太大区分度的两个商品同等的奖励对模型的收敛性不是特别好。

Q7：请问模型在线上会有探索的过程吗？探索的过程是否会造成收益的损失？

A：目前我们的模型是离线训练好后推至线上服务的，并且在一天之内不会进行参数更新，所以也没有线上的探索过程。目前online learning的模型已经全量上线了，之后我们会采用离线预训练好一个模型、在线做探索的方法进行一些尝试。但是，直接去线上做策略探索的话，损失是我们承担不起的，所以一般还是会有一个离线预训练模型，加上线上online learning进行policy的探索。

到目前为止，在讨论强化学习应用研究领域的单元中，我们看到了强化学习如何破坏机器人技术，自动驾驶，金融投资组合管理以及解决诸如围棋之类的极其复杂的游戏领域。 强化学习可能会破坏的另一个重要领域是广告技术。

在深入了解问题陈述及其基于强化学习的解决方案之前，让我们了解所涉及的挑战，业务模型和投标策略，这将成为理解我们将尝试使用强化学习框架解决问题的基本前提。 我们将在本章中介绍的主题如下：

计算广告挑战和出价策略

展示广告中使用强化学习的实时出价

广告是一种传达信息的方式。 计算广告的核心任务是在给定上下文中的给定用户和广告之间找到最佳匹配，其中适用以下因素：

在实现上述目标方面面临的核心挑战如下：

这些元素之间的关系如下所示：



广告平台的业务模型由不同的模型组成，这些模型控制广告商必须使用广告平台支付的应付金额度量。 计算广告领域中有不同的指标，如下所示：

赞助搜索在在线广告中起着重要作用，尤其是在诸如 Google，Yahoo，Bing 等搜索引擎中。 由于每天都有大量的受众访问这些搜索平台，因此它们是最大的广告平台。

广告客户对某些搜索查询的每次点击率进行出价，这些查询由搜索引擎接收。 然后，将广告显示为那些搜索查询结果的一部分，并且，如果用户单击广告，则广告商必须支付投标金额。

在所有广告客户将其每次点击费用的出价针对某些搜索查询进行出价后，平台会接收到数据，该数据包括不同广告客户的出价集以及每个广告客户的总预算，以及每个搜索查询的点击率（CTR）的历史数据。

主要目的是响应每个查询选择一组广告，以使搜索引擎（即出价商）获得的收益最大化。 就像出价师的收入最大化一样，广告商的利润最大化也很重要，并且包括各种出价策略。

广告客户的出价策略主要包括在出价时针对不同关键字的预算优化。 重点讨论如下：

此外，在这个在线广告世界中，竞标是实时发生的。 您如何实现更好的实时出价策略以实现利润最大化？

自主竞标智能体

使用强化学习的机器学习方法

在线展示主要通过实时出价来提供，其中，展示广告的每次展示都是在通过用户访问产生的同时实时出价的。 自动实时地出价对于广告商最大限度地提高利润至关重要。 因此，需要设计一种学习算法，该算法可以基于历史数据实时设计出最佳的学习策略，以便根据即时和未来的回报跨不同的印象进行预算的动态分配。 在这里，我们将讨论由 Cai 等人在《使用强化学习的展示广告中的实时出价》中发布​​的强化学习框架来制定出价决策过程。

在蔡等人的这项研究中。 此外，我们考虑了在展示广告的情况下进行机器竞标，因为实时竞标是一项极富挑战性的任务，因为在在线展示广告的情况下，只要它由用户访问生成，广告印象的竞标就会立即开始。 在考虑了剩余预算，未来相关广告展示的可用性，出价结果和收到的反馈之后，为每次广告出价计算最佳出价，这些都可以帮助广告客户优化出价策略，从而更好地进行分配。

在这里，研究人员试图获得最佳出价函数，该函数可以最大化广告活动的关键表现指标，这些指标主要是总点击次数或总收入。 但是，这种方法主要在静态出价的情况下起作用，在这种情况下，出价发生在广告商为每个展示支付固定的平均费率的情况下。 在实时出价的情况下，它在展示级别是动态的，这意味着在一个平台中，根据生成的展示的需求，出价值会有所不同。

本研究试图通过使用强化学习框架来解决实时竞标挑战，并将其作为顺序决策来解决，其中：

因此，在每个步骤中，代表广告商出价者的智能体都会观察到由当前广告系列参数（例如预算和剩余时间）以及针对该特定广告印象的出价请求组成的状态。 然后，它发布一个动作； 例如，确定出价，中奖结果和用户反馈将一起作为对所采取措施的奖励，并将用于加强模型。 由于在现实世界中出价量很大，因此 MDP 框架已与基于 Q 网络的方法一起使用，该方法使用神经网络作为状态作用值函数逼近器。 竞标的基本强化学习框架如下所示：



最初，预算b是​​提供给智能体的，此处的目标是在随后的出价t中获得尽可能多的点击。 以下是智能体考虑的重要信息：

在每个剧集中，每次出价都会按顺序发送给智能体，智能体针对每个智能体根据当前信息t，b和x。 因此，智能体基于出价的剩余时间，初始分配预算中剩余的剩余量以及提出的投标请求的所有关键信息来决定适当的动作。

如上图所示，智能体维护剩余的出价t和剩余的预算b。 在每个时间步，智能体都收到一个竞标请求以及出价x ∈ X（特征向量空间），并且它必须确定竞标价格a。

给定特征向量x的市场价格概率分布函数为m(δ, x)，其中δ是市场价格， m是其概率。 因此，如果智能体以a ≥ δ的价格出价，则它将赢得竞标并支付δ，剩余预算将变为b-δ。 万一失败，智能体从竞标中得不到任何东西。 在此，如果将赢得出价视为预期奖励，则将预测 CTR（pCTR）表示为θ(x)。 在每次出价之后，剩余的出价数量减少 1。当t = 0时，也就是说，没有剩余的出价，则剧集结束。 随着当前剧集的结束，剩余的出价编号和预算都将分别重置为T和B。

以下是前面的增强型学习框架要投标的实现的伪代码：

在本章中，我们了解了广告技术领域的基本概念和挑战。 我们还了解了相关的业务模型，例如 CPC，CPM 和 CPA，以及实时策略出价，以及为什么需要一个独立的智能体来使流程自动化。 此外，我们讨论了一种将在线广告中实时出价的问题状态转换为强化学习框架的基本方法。 这是用于强化学习的全新领域。 利用强化学习技术进行广告技术开发的更多探索性作品及其结果尚未发布。

在下一章中，我们将研究在计算机视觉领域，尤其是在对象检测中，如何使用强化学习。

# 强化学习在电商环境下的若干应用与研究-阿里云开发者社区

热门

随着搜索技术的持续发展，我们已经逐渐意识到监督学习算法在搜索场景的局限性：

与此同时，强化学习的深度学习化，以及以Atari游戏和围棋游戏为代表的应用在近几年得到了空前的发展，使得我们开始着眼于这项古老而又时尚的技术，并以此为一条重要的技术发展路线，陆陆续续地在多个业务和场景，进行了强化学习建模，取得了一些初步成果，相关的工作已经在整理发表中。同时我们也深知，目前强化学习的算法理论上限和工业界中大规模噪声数据之间，还存在着很大的gap，需要有更多的智慧去填补。

淘宝的搜索引擎涉及对上亿商品的毫秒级处理响应，而淘宝的用户不仅数量巨大，其行为特点以及对商品的偏好也具有丰富性和多样性。因此，要让搜索引擎对不同特点的用户作出针对性的排序，并以此带动搜索引导的成交提升，是一个极具挑战性的问题。传统的Learning to Rank（LTR）方法主要是在商品维度进行学习，根据商品的点击、成交数据构造学习样本，回归出排序权重。尽管Contextual LTR方法可以根据用户的上下文信息对不同的用户给出不同的排序结果，但它没有考虑到用户搜索商品是一个连续的过程。这一连续过程的不同阶段之间不是孤立的，而是有着紧密的联系。换句话说，用户最终选择购买或不够买商品，不是由某一次排序所决定，而是一连串搜索排序的结果。

实际上，如果把搜索引擎看作智能体（Agent）、把用户看做环境（Environment），则商品的搜索问题可以被视为典型的顺序决策问题（Sequential Decision-making Problem）：（1）在用户每一次请求PV时，Agent做出相应的排序决策，将商品展示给用户；（2）用户根据Agent的排序结果，给出点击、翻页等反馈信号；（3）Agent接收反馈信号，在新的PV请求时做出新的排序决策；（4）这样的过程将一直持续下去，直到用户购买商品或者退出搜索。以前向视角（Forward View）来看，用户在每个PV中的上下文状态与之前所有PV中的上下文状态和Agent的行为有着必然因果关系，同一个PV中Agent采取的不同排序策略将使得搜索过程朝不同的方向演进；反过来，以后向视角（Backward View）来看，在遇到相同的上下文状态时，Agent就可以根据历史演进的结果对排序策略进行调整，将用户引导到更有利于成交的PV中去。Agent每一次策略的选择可以看成一次试错（Trial-and-Error），在这种反复不断地试错过程中，Agent将逐步学习到最优的排序策略。而这种在与环境交互的过程中进行试错的学习，正是强化学习（Reinforcement Learning，RL）的根本思想。

强化学习最早可以追溯到巴甫洛夫的条件反射实验，它从动物行为研究和优化控制两个领域独立发展，最终经Bellman之手将其抽象为马尔可夫决策过程（Markov Decision Process，MDP）问题而完成形式化。对于环境反馈的有利奖赏，Agent将强化引发这种奖赏的动作，并在以后与环境交互的过程中更偏向于执行该动作。我们尝试将强化学习方法引入商品的搜索排序中，以优化用户在整个搜索过程中的收益为目标，根据用户实时行为反馈进行学习，实现商品排序的实时调控。图1 比较直观地展示了的用强化学习来优化搜索排序的过程。如图所示，在三次PV请求之间，Agent做出了两次排序决策（$a_1$和$a_2$），从而引导了两次PV展示。从效果上来看，$a_1$对应PV中并没有发生商品点击，而$a_2$对应PV上发生了3次商品点击。如果将商品点击看成是对排序策略的反馈信号，那么Agent第二次执行的排序策略$a_2$将得到正向的强化激励，而其第一次排序策略$a_1$得到的激励为零。本文接下来的内容将对我们具体的方案进行详细介绍。图1:搜索的序列决策模型

马尔可夫决策过程（Markov Decision Process，MDP）是强化学习的最基本理论模型。一般地，MDP可以由一个四元组表示：（1）S为状态空间（State Space），包含了Agent可能感知到的所有环境状态；（2）A为动作空间（Action Space），包含了Agent在每个状态上可以采取的所有动作；（3）$ R: S \times A \times S \rightarrow R $ 为奖赏函数（Reward Function），$ R(s,a,s') $表示在状态$s$上执行动作$a$，并转移到状态$s'$时，Agent从环境获得的奖赏值；（4）$T: S \times A \times S \rightarrow [0,1]$为环境的状态转移函数(State Transition Function)，$T(s,a,s')$表示在状态$s$上执行动作$a$，并转移到状态$s'$的概率。

图2 强化学习agent和环境交互

在MDP中，Agent和环境之间的交互过程可如图2所示：Agent感知当前环境状态$s_t$，从动作空间$A$中选择动作$a_t$执行；环境接收Agent所选择的动作之后，给以Agent相应的奖赏信号反馈$r_{t+1}$，并转移到新的环境状态$s_{t+1}$，等待Agent做出新的决策。在与环境的交互过程中，Agent的目标是找到一个最优策略${\pi}^*$，使得它在任意状态$s$和任意时间步骤$t$下，都能够获得最大的长期累积奖赏，即

$$ {\pi}^* = argmax_{\pi} \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \{ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k r_{t+k} | s_t = s \}, \forall s \in S, \forall t \geq 0. $$

在这里，$\pi: S \times A \rightarrow [0,1]$表示Agent的某个策略（即状态到动作的概率分布），$\mathbb{E}_{\pi}$表示策略$\pi$下的期望值，$\gamma \in [0,1)$为折扣率（Discount Rate），$k$为未来时间步骤，$r_{t+k}$表示Agent在时间步骤$(t+k)$上获得的即时奖赏。

强化学习主要通过寻找最优状态值函数（Optimal State Value Function）

$$ V^*(s) = \max_{\pi} \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \{ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k r_{t+k} | s_t = s \}, \forall s \in S, \forall t \geq 0 $$

或最优状态动作值函数（Optimal State-Action Value Function）

$$ Q^*(s,a) = \max_{\pi} \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \{ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k r_{t+k} | s_t = s, a_t = a \}, \forall s \in S, \forall a \in A, \forall t \geq 0 $$

来学习最优策略$ {\pi}^* $。经典的强化学习算法（如：SARSA, Q-learning等）将值函数用状态空间到动作空间的一张表来进行表达，并通过广义策略迭代（Generalized Policy Iteration）方法对最优值函数进行逼近，从而得到最优策略${\pi}^*$。然而，在大规模状态/动作空间问题（包括连续状态/动作空间问题）中，值表形式的值函数所需要的存储空间远远超过了现代计算机的硬件条件，使得这些经典的算法不再适用。这也即强化学习中的著名的“维度灾难”问题。

值函数估计（Value Function Approximation）是解决维度灾难问题的主要手段之一，其主要思想是将状态值函数或动作值函数进行参数化，将值函数 空间转化为转化为参数空间，达到泛化(Generalization)的目的。以状态值函数为例，在参数向量$ \theta $下，任意状态$s$的值$V(s)$可以表达为

$$ V_{\theta}(s) = f_{\theta}(\phi(s)). $$

其中，$\phi(s)$为状态$s$的特征向量，$f$为定义在状态特征空间上的某个函数，其具体形式取决于算法本身。因此，对值函数$V(s)$的学习也就转化为了对参数向量$\theta$的学习。基于对函数$f$采用的不同形式，强化学习领域也发展出了不同的子分支，这其中包括：线性函数估计方法，回归树方法，神经网络方法，基于核的强化学习方法等。值得一提的是，深度强化学习（Deep Reinforcement Learning，DRL）本质上属于采用神经网络作为值函数估计器的一类方法，其主要优势在于它能够利用深度神经网络对状态特征进行自动抽取，避免了人工定义状态特征带来的不准确性，使得Agent能够在更原始的状态上进行学习。

在我们的方案中，用户被视为响应Agent动作的环境，Agent需要感知环境状态进行决策。因此，如何定义环境状态使其能够准确反映出用户对商品的偏好是首要问题。假设用户在搜索的过程中倾向于点击他感兴趣的商品，并且较少点击他不感兴趣的商品。基于这个假设，我们将用户的历史点击行为作为抽取状态特征的数据来源。具体地，在每一个PV请求发生时，我们把用户在最近一段时间内点击的商品的特征（包括：价格、转化率、销量等）作为当前Agent感知到的状态，令$s$代表状态，则有

$$ s = (price_1, cvr_1, sale_1, ..., price_n, cvr_n, sale_n). $$

其中，$n$表示历史点击商品的个数，为可变参数，$price_i$、$cvr_i$、$sale_i$分别代表商品$i$（$0 \leq i \leq n$）的价格、转化率和销量。另外，为了区别不同群体的用户，我们还将用户的长期特征加入到了状态的定义中，最终的状态定义为

$$ s = (price_1, cvr_1, sale_1, ..., price_n, cvr_n, sale_n, power, item, shop). $$

其中，$power$、$item$和$shop$分别代表用户的购买力、偏好宝贝以及偏好店铺特征。在具体算法实现时，由于状态特征不同维度的尺度不一样，我们会将所有维度的特征值归一化到$[0,1]$区间内，再进行后续处理。

当状态空间$S$和动作空间$A$确定好之后（动作空间即Agent能够选择排序策略的空间），状态转移函数$T$也随即确定，但奖赏函数$R$仍然是个未知数。奖赏函数$R$定义的是状态与动作之间的数值关系，而我们要解决的问题并非是一个天然存在的MDP，这样的数值关系并不存在。因此，另一个重要的步骤是把我们要达到的目标（如：提高点击率、提高GMV等）转化为具体的奖赏函数$R$，在学习过程中引导Agent完成我们的目标。

幸运的是，这样的转化在我们的场景中并不复杂。如前所述，Agent给出商品排序，用户根据排序的结果进行的浏览、商品点击或购买等行为都可以看成对Agent的排序策略的直接反馈。我们采取的奖赏函数定义规则如下：（1）在一个PV中如果仅发生商品点击，则相应的奖赏值为用户点击的商品的数量；（2）在一个PV中如果发生商品购买，则相应奖赏值为被购买商品的价格；（3）其他情况下，奖赏值为0。从直观上来理解，第一条规则表达的是提高CTR这一目标，而第二条规则表达的则是提高GMV。在第四章中，我们将利用奖赏塑形（Reward Shaping）方法对奖赏函数的表达进行丰富，提高不同排序策略在反馈信号上的区分度。

在搜索场景中，排序策略实际上是一组权重向量，我们用$\mu = (\mu_1, \mu_2, ..., \mu_m)$来表示。每个商品最终的排序次序是由其特征分数和排序权重向量$\mu$的内积所决定的。一个排序权重向量是Agent的一个动作，那么排序权重向量的欧式空间就是Agent的动作空间。根据2.1节对状态的定义可知，我们的状态空间也是连续的数值空间。因此，我们面临的问题是在两个连续的数值空间中学习出最优的映射关系。

策略逼近（Policy Approximation）方法是解决连续状态/动作空间问题的有效方法之一。其主要思想和值函数估计方法类似，即用参数化的函数对策略进行表达，通过优化参数来完成策略的学习。通常，这种参数化的策略函数被称为Actor。我们采用确定性策略梯度算法（Deterministic Policy Gradient，DPG）算法来进行排序的实时调控优化。在该算法中，Actor的输出是一个确定性的策略（即某个动作），而非一个随机策略（即动作的概率分布）。对于连续动作空间问题，确定性策略函数反而让策略改进（Policy Improvement）变得更加方便了，因为贪心求最优动作可以直接由函数输出。

我们采用的Actor以状态的特征为输入，以最终生效的排序权重分为输出。假设我们一共调控$m$（$m \geq 0$）个维度的排序权重，对于任意状态$s \in S$，Actor对应的输出为

$$ \mu_{\theta}(s) = (\mu^1_{\theta}(s), \mu^2_{\theta}(s), ..., \mu^m_{\theta}(s) ). $$

其中，$theta = (theta_1, theta_2, …, theta_m)$为actor的参数向量，对于任意$i (1 ≤ i ≤ m)$，$\mu_{\theta}^i (s)$为第$i$维的排序权重分，具体地有

$$ \mu^i_{\theta} = \frac{ C_i \exp(\theta_i^{\top} \phi(s)) }{ \sum_{j=1}^m \exp(\theta_j^{\top} \phi(s)) }. $$

在这里，$\phi(s)$为状态$s$的特征向量，$\theta_1, \theta_2,..., \theta_m$均为长度与$\phi(s)$相等的向量，$C_i$为第$i$维排序权重分的常数，用来对其量级进行控制（不同维度的排序权重分会有不同的量级）。

回顾一下，强化学习的目标是最大化任意状态$s$上的长期累积奖赏（参考2.1节中对$V^*$和$Q^*$的定义）。实际上，我们可以用一个更一般地形式来表达这一目标，即

$$ \begin{split} J(\mu_{\theta}) &= \int_S \int_S \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \gamma^{t-1} p_0(s') T(s', \mu_{\theta}(s'), s) R(s, \mu_{\theta}(s)) \text{ d}s' \text{ d}s \\ &= \int_S \rho^{\mu}(s) R(s, \mu_{\theta}) \text{ d}s \\ &= \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho^{\mu}} [R(s, \mu_{\theta}(s) )]. \end{split} $$

其中，$\rho^{\mu}(s) = \int_S \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \gamma^{t-1} p_0(s') T(s', \mu_{\theta}(s'), s) \text{ d}s'$表示状态$s$在一直持续的学习过程中被访问的概率，$p_0$为初始时刻的状态分布，$T$为环境的状态转移函数。不难推测，$J({\mu_{\theta}})$实际上表达的是在确定性策略$\mu_{\theta}$的作用下，Agent在所有状态上所能够获得的长期累积奖赏期望之和。通俗地讲，也就是Agent在学习过程中得到的所有奖赏值。

显然，为了最大化$J({\mu_{\theta}})$，我们需要求得$J({\mu_{\theta}})$关于参数$\theta$的梯度，让$\theta$往梯度方向进行更新。根据策略梯度定理（Policy Gradient Theorem），$J({\mu_{\theta}})$关于$\theta$的梯度为

$$ \begin{split} \nabla_{\theta} J(\mu_{\theta}) &= \int_S \rho^{\mu}(s) \nabla_{\theta} \mu_{\theta}(s) \nabla_a Q^{\mu}(s,a) | a=\mu_{\theta}(s) \text{ d}s \\ &= \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho^{\mu}} [\nabla_{\theta} \mu_{\theta}(s) \nabla_a Q^{\mu}(s,a) | a=\mu_{\theta}(s)]. \end{split} $$

其中，$Q^{\mu}(s,a)$为策略$\mu_{\theta}$下状态动作对（State-Action Pair）$(s,a)$对应的长期累积奖赏。 因此，参数$\theta$的更新公式可以写为

$$ \theta_{t+1} \leftarrow \theta_{t} + \alpha_{\theta} \nabla_{\theta} \mu_{\theta}(s) \nabla_a Q^{\mu}(s,a) | a=\mu_{\theta}(s). $$

在这个公式中，$\alpha_{\theta}$为学习率，$\nabla_{\theta} \mu_{\theta}(s)$为一个Jacobian Matrix，能够很容易地算出来，但麻烦的是$Q^{\mu}(s,a)$及其梯度$\nabla_a Q^{\mu}(s,a)$的计算。因为$s$和$a$都是连续的数值，我们无法精确获取$Q^{\mu}(s,a)$的值，只能通过值函数估计方法进行近似计算。我们采用线性函数估计方法（Linear Function Approximation，LFA），将$Q$函数用参数向量$w$进行表达：

$$ Q^{\mu}(s,a) \approx Q^w(s,a) = \phi(s,a)^{\top} w. $$

在这里，$\phi(s,a)$为状态动作对$(s,a)$的特征向量。采用线性值函数估计的好处不仅在于它的计算量小，更重要的是在它能让我们找到合适的$\phi(s,a)$的表达，使得$\nabla_a Q^w(s,a)$可以作为$\nabla_a Q^{\mu}(s,a)$的无偏估计。一个合适的选择是令$\phi(s,a) = a^{\top} \nabla_{\theta} \mu_{\theta}(s)$，则可以得到

$$ \nabla_a Q^{\mu}(s,a) \approx \nabla_a Q^w(s,a) = \nabla_a (a^{\top} \nabla_{\theta} \mu_{\theta}(s))^{\top} w = \nabla_{\theta} \mu_{\theta}(s)^{\top} w. $$

因此，策略函数的参数向量$\theta$的更新公式可以写为

$$ \theta_{t+1} \leftarrow \theta_{t} + \alpha_{\theta} \nabla_{\theta} \mu_{\theta}(s) (\nabla_{\theta} \mu_{\theta}(s)^{\top} w). $$

在更新策略函数$\mu_{\theta}$的参数向量$\theta$的同时，值函数$Q^w$的参数向量$w$也需要进行更新。最简单地，$w$的更新可以参照Q-learning算法[4, 5]的线性函数估计版本进行，对于样本$(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})$，有：

$$ \begin{split} \delta_{t+1} &= r_t + \gamma Q^w(s_{t+1}, \mu_{\theta}(s_{t+1})) - Q^w(s_t, a_t) \\ &= r_t + w_t^{\top} (\gamma \phi(s_{t+1}, \mu_{\theta}(s_{t+1}) - \phi(s_t, a_t) ) \\ w_{t+1} &= w_t + \alpha_w \delta_{t+1} \phi(s_t, a_t) \\ &= w_t + \alpha_w \delta_{t+1} (a_t^{\top} \nabla_{\theta} \mu_{\theta}(s_t) ). \end{split} $$

其中，$s_t$、$a_t$、$r_t$和$s_{t+1}$为Agent在$t$时刻感知的状态、所做的动作、从环境获得的奖赏反馈和在$(t+1)$时刻感知的状态，$\delta_{t+1}$被称作差分误差（Temporal-Difference Error），$\alpha_w$为$w$的学习率。

需注意的是，Q-learning的线性函数估计版本并不能保证一定收敛。并且，在大规模动作空间问题中，线性形式的$Q$函数较难在整个值函数空间范围中精确地估计每一个状态动作对的值。一个优化的办法是引入优势函数（Advantage Function），将$Q$函数用状态值函数$V(s)$和优势函数$A(s, a)$的和进行表达。我们用$V(s)$从全局角度估计状态$s$的值，用$A(s, a)$从局部角度估计动作$a$在状态s中的相对于其他动作的优势。具体地，我们有

$$ Q(s,a) = A^w(s,a) + V^v(s) = (a-\mu_{\theta}(s))^{\top} \nabla_{\theta} \mu_{\theta}(s)^{\top} w + \phi(s)^{\top} v. $$

在这里，$w$和$v$分别为$A$和$V$的参数向量。最后，我们将所有参数$\theta$、$w$和$v$的更新方式总结如下：

$$ \begin{split} \delta_{t+1} &= r_t + \gamma Q(s_{t+1}, \mu_{\theta}(s_{t+1})) - Q(s_t, a_t) \\ &= r_t + \gamma \phi(s_{t+1})^{\top} v_t - ( (a_t - \mu_{\theta}(s_t))^{\top} \nabla_{\theta} \mu_{\theta}(s_t)^{\top} w_t + \phi(s_t)^{\top} v_t ) \\ \theta_{t+1} &= \theta_t + \alpha_{\theta} \nabla_{\theta} \mu_{\theta}(s_t) (\nabla_{\theta} \mu_{\theta}(s_t)^{\top} w_t) \\ w_{t+1} &= w_t + \alpha_w \delta_{t+1} \phi(s_t,a_t) = w_t + \alpha_w \delta_{t+1} (a_t^{\top} \nabla_{\theta} \mu_{\theta}(s_t)) \\ v_{t+1} &= v_t + \alpha_v \delta_{t+1} \phi(s_t) \end{split} $$

第二章定义的奖赏函数是一个非常简单化的版本，我们在初步的实验中构造了一个连续状态空间/离散动作空间问题对其进行了验证。具体地，我们采用了2.2节定义的状态表示方法，同时人工选取15组固定的排序策略，通过线性值函数估计控制算法GreedyGQ来学习相应的状态动作值函数$Q(s,a)$。从实验结果中，我们发现学习算法虽然最终能够稳定地区分开不同的动作，但它们之间的差别并不大。一方面，这并不会对算法收敛到最优产生影响；但另一个方面，学习算法收敛的快慢却会大受影响，而这是在实际应用中我们必须要考虑的问题。

在淘宝主搜这种大规模应用的场景中，我们较难在短时间内观察到不同的排序策略在点击和成交这样的宏观指标上的差别。因此，我们有必要在奖赏函数中引入更多的信息，增大不同动作的区分度。以商品点击为例，考虑不同的用户$A$和$B$在类似的状态中发生的商品点击行为。若$A$点击商品的价格较高，$B$点击商品的价格较低，那么就算$A$和$B$点击的商品数量相同，我们也可以认为的对$A$和$B$采用的排序策略带来的影响是不同的。同样的，对于商品的成交，价格相同而销量不同的商品成交也具有差别。因此，在原有的基础上，我们将商品的一些属性特征加入到奖赏函数的定义中，通过奖赏塑形（Reward Shaping）的方法丰富其包含的信息量。

奖赏塑形的思想是在原有的奖赏函数中引入一些先验的知识，加速强化学习算法的收敛。简单地，我们可以将“在状态$s$上选择动作$a$，并转移到状态$s'$”的奖赏值定义为

$$ R(s,a,s' ) = R_0(s,a,s') + \Phi(s). $$

其中，$R_0(s,a,s')$为原始定义的奖赏函数，$\Phi(s)$为包含先验知识的函数，也被称为势函数（Potential Function）。我们可以把势函数$\Phi(s)$理解学习过程中的子目标（Local Objective）。例如，在用强化学习求解迷宫问题中，可以定义$\Phi(s)$为状态$s$所在位置与出口的曼哈顿距离（或其他距离），使得Agent更快地找到潜在的与出口更近的状态。根据上面的讨论，我们把每个状态对应PV的商品信息纳入Reward的定义中，将势函数$\Phi(s)$定义为

$$ \Phi(s) = \sum_{i=1}^K \mathbb{M}\mathbb{L}(i|\mu_{\theta}(s)). $$

其中，$K$为状态$s$对应PV中商品的个数，$i$表示的第$i$个商品，$\mu_{\theta}(s)$为Agent在状态$s$执行的动作，$\mathbb{M}\mathbb{L}(i|\mu_{\theta}(s))$表示排序策略为$\mu_{\theta}(s)$时对商品的点击（或成交）的极大似然（Maximum Likelihood）估计。因此，$\Phi(s)$也就表示在状态$s$上执行动作$\mu_{\theta}(s)$时，PV中所有商品能够被点击（或购买）的极大似然概率之和。

下面我们给出的$\mathbb{M}\mathbb{L}(i|\mu_{\theta}(s))$具体形式。令商品$i$的特征向量（即价格、销量、人气分、实时分等特征）为$x_i = (x^1_i, x^2_i, ..., x^m_i)$，则$x_i^{\top} \mu_{\theta}(s)$即为商品$i$在状态$s$下的最终排序分数。又令$y_i \in \{ 0, 1 \}$为商品$i$实际被点击（或成交）的label，并假设意商品$i$的实际点击（或成交）的概率$p_i$与其排序分数$x_i^{\top} \mu_{\theta}(s)$满足$\ln{\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}} = x_i^{\top} \mu_{\theta}(s)$，则商品$i$的似然概率为

$$ \mathbb{M}\mathbb{L} = {p_i}^{y_i} (1-p_i)^{1-y_i} = (\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x_i^{\top} \mu_{\theta}(s))})^{y_i} (\frac{1}{1+\exp(x_i^{\top} \mu_{\theta}(s))})^{1-y_i}. $$

为简化计算，我们对$\mathbb{B}\mathbb{L}$取对数，得到对数似然概率

$$ \mathbb{M}\mathbb{L}_{log}(i|\mu_{\theta}(s)) = y_i x_i^{\top} \mu_{\theta}(s) - \ln(1+\exp(x_i^{\top} \mu_{\theta}(s))). $$

将PV中所有商品的对数似然概率综合起来，则有

$$ \Phi(s) = \sum_{i=1}^K y_i x_i^{\top} \mu_{\theta}(s) - \ln(1+\exp(x_i^{\top} \mu_{\theta}(s))). $$

我们最终实现的奖赏塑形方法将点击和成交均纳入考虑中，对于只有点击的PV样本，其对应的奖赏势函数为

$$ \Phi_{clk}(s) = \sum_{i=1}^K y^c_i x_i^{\top} \mu_{\theta}(s) - \ln(1+\exp(x_i^{\top} \mu_{\theta}(s))). $$

其中，$y^c_i$是商品$i$被点击与否的label。而对于有成交发生的PV样本，我们将商品价格因素加入到奖赏势函数中，得到

$$ \Phi_{pay}(s) = \sum_{i=1}^K y^p_i x_i^{\top} \mu_{\theta}(s) - \ln(1+\exp(x_i^{\top} \mu_{\theta}(s))) + \ln \text{ Price}_i. $$

其中，$y^p_i$和$\text{ Price}_i$分别是商品$i$被购买与否的label和它的价格。从直观上来理解，$\Phi_{clk}(s)$和$\Phi_{pay}(s)$将分别引导Agent对点击率和GMV的对数似然进行优化。

实际上，我们所采用的奖赏塑形方法来自于LTR方法的启发。LTR方法的有效性在于它能够利用商品维度的信息来进行学习，其最终学习到的排序权重和商品特征有直接相关性。我们通过把商品的特征灌注到奖赏函数中，能让Agent的动作在具体商品上产生的影响得到刻画，因此也就能更好地在数值信号上将不同的动作区分开来。另外，与以往的奖赏塑形方法不同的是，我们采用的势函数是随着策略的学习变化的，它让Reward和Action之间产生了相互作用：Action的计算将朝着最大化Reward的方向进行，而Action的生效投放也反过来影响了Reward的产生。因此，学习算法实际上是在非独立同分布的数据上进行训练的，我们将在最后一章对该问题进行探讨。

在双十一期间，我们对强化学习方案进行了测试，下图展示了我们的算法在学习的过程中的误差变化情况，衡量学习误差的指标为Norm of the Expected TD Update（NEU），是差分误差（TD Error）与状态动作特征向量乘积的期望值，图中的RNEU表示NEU的平方根。从理论上来讲，RNEU越小表示算法学习到的策略越接近最优。图3: Norm of the Expected TD Update可以看到，从启动开始，每个桶上的RNEU开始逐渐下降。之后，下降趋势变得比较缓和，说明学习算法在逐步往最优策略进行逼近。但过了零点之后，每个桶对应的RNEU指标都出现了陡然上升的情况，这是因为0点前后用户的行为发生了急剧变化，导致线上数据分布在0点以后与0点之前产生较大差别。相应地，学习算法获取到新的reward信号之后，也会做出适应性地调整。

接下来，我们再对双十一当天排序权重分的变化情况进行考查。我们一共选取了若干个精排权重分来进行实时调控，下面两幅图分别展示了iphone和android中，每个维度的排序权重分在一天内的变化。每个维度的排序权重分在一天内的变化（iphone）每个维度的排序权重分在一天内的变化（android）从0点到早上10:00这一时间段内，无论是在android端还是iphone端，都没有出现某个维度的排序权重分占绝对主导地位。在11号凌晨和上午，全网大部分的成交其实不在搜索端，在这段时间内，用户产生的数据相对没有这么丰富，可能还不足以将重要的排序权重分凸显出来。而到了10:00以后，我们可以发现某一个维度的排序权重分逐渐开始占据主导，并且其主导过程一直持续到了当天结束。在iphone端占据主导的是某大促相关的分（绿色曲线），而android端的则是某转化率的分（红色曲线）。这其实也从侧面说明了iphone端和android端的用户行为存在较大差别。

在最终的投放效果上，强化学习桶相对于基准桶整体提升了很大幅度，同时强化学习桶在CTR方面的提升高于其它绝大部分非强化学习桶，证明我们所采用的奖赏塑形方法确实有效地将优化CTR的目标融入了奖赏函数中。

在双11之后，我们对之前的方案进行了技术升级，一个直接的优化是DPG升级为DDPG，即将actor模型和critic模型升级为actor网络$\mu(s|\theta^{\mu})$和critic网络$Q(s,a|\theta^Q)$。此外，我们还增加了一个ltr loss层$L(a,X，Y)$，用于衡量actor网络输出的a，在pointwise ltr上的cross entropy loss，这里$X=[x_1,x_2,...,x_n]$是$n$个宝贝的归一化的特征分向量，$Y=[y_1,y_2,...,y_n]是对应的点击、成交的label$。具体地：

$$ L(a,X,Y) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i^n y_i \log(\sigma(a^T x_i)) + (1-y_i)\log(1-\sigma(a^T x_i)) $$

这里 $\sigma(a^T x_i)=1/(1+\exp(-a^Tx_i))$。因此最终的actor的网络的梯度为

$$ \nabla_{\theta^{\mu}} J = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_i^N \nabla_a Q(s,a|\theta^Q)|_{s=s_i,a=\mu(s_i)}\nabla_{\theta^{\mu}} \mu(s|\theta^{\mu})|_{s_i} + \nonumber $$

$$ \lambda \nabla_a L(a,X,Y)|_{a=\mu(s_i)}\nabla_{\theta^{\mu}} \mu(s|\theta^{\mu})|_{s_i} $$

大致的整体框架图如下所示：监督学习和强化学习的多任务学习网络这个整体实现，较之前的DPG方案，一方面可以受益于深度神经网络强大的表征能力，另一方面也可以从监督学习网络获得很好的梯度，获得较好的初始化，并保证整个训练过程中的稳定性。

总的来说，我们将强化学习应用到淘宝的搜索场景中只是一次初步尝试，有很多方面都需要进一步探索，现将我们在未来需要改进的地方以及可能的探索方向归纳如下：

（1）状态的表示：我们将用户最近点击的商品特征和用户长期行为特征作为状态，其实是基于这样的一个假设，即用户点击过的商品能够较为精确地反映用户的内心活动和对商品的偏好。但实际上，用户对商品的点击通常具有盲目性，无论什么商品可能都想要看一看。也就是说，我们凭借经验所设定的状态并非那么准确。深度强化学习对状态特征的自动抽取能力是它在Atari Game和围棋上取得成功的重要原因之一。因此，在短期内可以考虑利用深度强化学习对现有方案进行扩展。同时，借助深度神经网络对状态特征的自动抽取，我们也可以发现用户的哪些行为对于搜索引擎的决策是比较重要的。

（2）奖赏函数的设定：和状态的定义一样，我们在第二章设定的奖赏函数也来自于人工经验。奖赏塑形（Reward Shaping）虽然是优化奖赏函数的方法，但其本质上也是启发式函数，其更多的作用在于对学习算法的加速。逆强化学习（Inverse Reinforcement Learning，IRL）是避免人工设定的奖赏函数的有效途径之一，也是强化学习研究领域的重要分支。IRL的主要思想是根据已知的专家策略或行为轨迹，通过监督学习的方法逆推出问题模型的奖赏函数。Agent在这样的奖赏函数上进行学习，就能还原出专家策略。对于我们的问题，IRL的现有方法不能完全适用，因为我们的搜索任务并不存在一个可供模仿的专家策略。我们需要更深入思考如何在奖赏函数与我们的目标（提升CTR，提升成交笔数）之间建立紧密的关系。

（3）多智能体强化学习（Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, MARL）：我们将搜索引擎看作Agent，把用户看成响应Agent动作的环境，属于典型的单智能体强化学习（Single-Agent RL）模式。在单智能体强化学习的理论模型（即MDP）中，环境动态（Environmental Dynamics，也即奖赏函数和状态转移函数）是不会发生变化的；而在我们的问题中，用户的响应行为却是非静态的，同时也带有随机性。因此，单智能体强化学习的模式未必是我们的最佳方案。要知道，用户其实也是在一定程度理性控制下的，能够进行自主决策甚至具有学习能力的Agent。从这样的视角来看，或许更好的方式是将用户建模为另外一个Agent，对这个Agent的行为进行显式地刻画，并通过多智能体强化学习[21]方法来达到搜索引擎Agent和用户Agent之间的协同（Coordination）。

（4）第四章的末尾提到了奖赏函数与Agent的动作的相互作用带来的非独立同分布数据问题，我们在这里再进行一些讨论。在MDP模型中，奖赏函数$R(s,a,s')$（有时又写成$R(s,a)$）是固定的，不会随着Agent策略的变化而变化。然而，在我们提出的奖赏塑形方法中，势函数$\Phi_{clk}(s)$和$\Phi_{pay}(s)$中包含了策略参数$\theta$，使得Agent从环境获得的奖赏信号在不同的$\theta$下有所不同。这也意味着我们的Agent实际上是处于一个具有动态奖赏函数的环境中，这种动态变化不是来自于外部环境，而是源于Agent的策略改变。这有点类似于人的行为与世界的相互作用。这样一来，我们可以将3.2节的$J(\mu_{\theta})$重写为

$$ \begin{split} \bar{J}(\mu_{\theta}) &= \int_S \int_S \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \gamma^{t-1} p_0(s') T(s', \mu_{\theta}(s'), s) R_{\theta}(s, \mu_{\theta}(s)) \text{ d}s' \text{ d}s \\ &= \int_S \rho^{\mu}(s) R_{\theta}(s, \mu_{\theta}) \text{ d}s. \end{split} $$

其中，$R_{\theta}$为Agent的策略参数$\theta$的函数。虽然$J(\mu_{\theta})$与$\bar{J}(\mu_{\theta})$之间只有一个符号之差，但这微小的变化也许会导致现有的强化学习算法无法适用，我们在未来的工作中将从理论上来深入研究这个问题的解决方法。





虽然从顺序决策的角度来讲，强化学习在这些场景中的应用是合理的，但我们并没有回答一些根本性的问题，比如：在搜索场景中采用强化学习和采用多臂老虎机有什么本质区别？从整体上优化累积收益和分别独立优化每个决策步骤的即时收益有什么差别？每当有同行问到这些问题时，我们总是无法给出让人信服的回答。因为我们还没思考清楚一个重要的问题，即：在搜索场景的顺序决策过程中，任意决策点的决策与后续所能得到的结果之间的关联性有多大？从强化学习的角度讲，也就是后续结果要以多大的比例进行回传，以视为对先前决策的延迟激励。也就是说我们要搞清楚延迟反馈在搜索场景中的作用。本文将以继续以搜索场景下调节商品排序策略为例，对这个问题展开探讨。本文余下部分的将组织如下：第二节对搜索排序问题的建模进行回顾，第三节将介绍最近的线上数据分析结果，第四节将对搜索排序问题进行形式化定义，第五节和第六节分别进行理论分析和实验分析并得出结论。







图1. 搜索引擎与用户交互示意图

如果把搜索引擎看作智能体（Agent）、把用户看做环境（Environment），那么图1展示的交互过程对于搜索引擎Agent来讲是一个典型的顺序决策问题。若从强化学习的视角来看，图1所展示的过程就是一次Episode，可以重新用图2进行描述。在图2中，蓝色的节点表示一次PV请求，也对应Agent进行状态感知的时刻，红色的节点表示Agent的动作，绿色箭头表示对Agent动作的即时奖赏激励。





图2. 搜索引擎Agent决策过程示意图

需要注意的是，由于搜索引擎每一次的决策都是在PV请求时发生的，所以决策过程中的状态与展示的商品页是一一对应的。更严格地来讲，每一个决策点的状态应该是“这个决策点之前所有商品页面包含的信息总和”，包括这些页面展示的商品信息，以及用户在这些页面上的实时行为。在目前的系统实现中，由于性能、信息获取条件的限制，现有的状态表示中并没有完全囊括这些信息。但抛开具体的状态表示方法不谈，我们可以认为一个商品页就是一个状态。在下一节中，我们将以PV为单位对线上数据进行统计分析，希望能够发现这个搜索排序问题的一些特性。





图3. 全类目数据下所有成交Episode的长度分布情况

从图3的结果中，可以看到Episode的长度越大，其对应的占总体的比例越小。这与“越往后的PV转化率越低”的经验是相符的。从绝对数值上看，超过$60\%$的成交都是在前$6$个PV中发生的，而$n=1$、$2$、$3$的比例更是分别超过了$20\%$、$15\%$和$10\%$。当然，图4的结果来自于对全类目数据的统计。为了消除类目间差异给统计结果带来的影响，我们选取了“连衣裙”、“女鞋”和“婴幼儿服饰”这三个成交量较大的类目，分别进行了相同的统计分析，相应的结果展示在图4-6中。



图4. 连衣裙类目下所有成交Episode的长度分布情况



图5. 女鞋类目下所有成交Episode的长度分布情况



图6. 婴幼儿服饰类目下所有成交Episode的长度分布情况

虽然分类目统计结果与全类目的结果在绝对数值上有一定差别，但还是呈现出了相同的趋势。如果不考虑具体的数值，我们至少可以得出一个结论：用户在看过任意数量的商品展示页之后，都有可能发生成交。根据这个结论，我们可以将一次搜索会话过程用图7的抽象示意图来描述。如图所示，垂直方向的箭头由上向下表示用户不停翻页的过程。每翻一页，用户选择商品的范围就增加一页，PV的History也对应地发生变化。横向地来看，用户在任意的PV History下，都有可能选择购买某个被展示的商品，或者继续往下翻页。当然，如果考虑到用户也有可能离开搜索引擎，我们可以得到图8中的更一般的示意图。





图7. 仅考虑成交和翻页的搜索会话图示 图8. 考虑成交、翻页和用户离开的搜索会话图示

在我们的场景中，“成交”和“离开搜索引擎”均被视为一个Episode的终止状态。如果把图8和马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）的状态、状态转移等要素对应起来，就可以发现搜索排序问题的明显特征：任意非终止状态都有一定的概率转移到终止状态。这同一些典型的强化学习应用场景相比有很大不同。比如，在网格世界和迷宫问题中，只有与邻近终点的位置才有非零的概率转移到终止状态。在接下来的内容中，我们将根据搜索排序问题的特点对其进行形式化定义，并在此基础上做相应的理论分析。



定义1. [Top $K$ List] 给定商品集合$\mathcal{D}$，排序函数$f$，以及一个正整数$K$ ($1 \leq K \leq |\mathcal{D}|$)，关于$\mathcal{D}$和$f$的top $K$ list，记为$\mathcal{L}_K(\mathcal{D}, f)$，是用函数$f$对$\mathcal{D}$中商品进行打分以后的前$K$个商品的有序列表$(\mathcal{I}_1, \mathcal{I}_2, ..., \mathcal{I}_K)$。其中，$\mathcal{I}_k$是排在第$k$位的商品（$1 \leq k \leq K$），并且对于任意$k' \geq k$，都有$f(\mathcal{I}_k) > f(\mathcal{I}_{k'})$。

定义2. [Item Page] 令$\mathcal{D}$为关于某个query的商品全集，$K$ ($K > 0$) 为一个页面能够展示的商品数量。对于一个搜索会话的任意时间步$t$ ($t \geq 1$)，其对应的item page $p_{t}$是关于的第$(t-1)$步的打分函数$a_{t-1}$和未展示商品集合$\mathcal{D}_{t-1}$的top $K$ list $\mathcal{L}_K(\mathcal{D}_{t-1}, a_{t-1})$。对于初始时间步$t = 0$，有$\mathcal{D}_0 = \mathcal{D}$。对于其他任意时间步$t \geq 1$，有$\mathcal{D}_t = \mathcal{D}_{t-1} \setminus p_{t}$。

定义3. [Item Page History] 令$q$为一个搜索会话的query。对于初始时间步$t = 0$，对应的初始item page history为$h_0 = q$。对于任意其他时间步$t \geq 1$，对应的item page history为$h_t = (h_{t-1}, p_t)$。在这里，$h_{t-1}$为第$(t-1)$步的item page history，$p_t$为第$t$步的item page。

对于任意时间步骤$t$，item page history $h_t$包含了用户在$t$时刻能够观察到的所以上下文信息。由于商品全集$\mathcal{D}$是一个有限集合，不难发现一个搜索会话最多包含$\lceil \frac{|\mathcal{D}|}{K} \rceil$个item page。对于搜索引擎来讲，它在一个搜索会话中最多决策$\lceil \frac{|\mathcal{D}|}{K} \rceil$次。根据我们之前的数据分析，不同的用户会在不同的时间步上选择购买或者离开。如果我们把所有用户看作一个能够采样出不同用户行为的environment，就意味着这个environment可能会在任意时间步上以一定的成交转化概率（conversion probability）或者放弃概率（abandon probability）来终止一个搜索会话。我们形式化定义这两种概率如下。

定义4. [Conversion Probability] 对于一个搜索会话中的任意item page history $h_t$ ($t > 0$)，令$B(h_t)$表示用户在观察到$h_t$之后发生购买行为的随机事件，则$h_t$的conversion probability，记为$b(h_t)$，就是事件$B(h_t)$在$h_t$下发生的概率。

定义5. [Abandon Probability] 对于一个搜索会话中的任意item page history $h_t$ ($t > 0$)，令$L(h_t)$表示用户在观察到$h_t$之后离开搜索会话的随机事件，则$h_t$的abandon probability，记为$l(h_t)$，就是事件$L(h_t)$在$h_t$下发生的概率。

由于$h_t$是在$(t-1)$时刻的item page history $h_{t-1}$上执行动作$a_{t-1}$的直接结果，因此$b(h_t)$和$l(h_t)$也表征了Agent在$h_{t-1}$上执行动作$a_{t-1}$之后环境状态的转移：（1）以$b(h_t)$的成交概率终止搜索会话；（2）以$l(h_t)$的离开概率终止搜索会话；（3）以$(1 - b(h_t) - l(h_t))$的概率继续搜索会话。方便起见，我们对用户继续进行搜索会话对概率也进行形式化描述。

定义6. [Continuing Probability] 对于一个搜索会话中的任意item page history $h_t$ ($t > 0$)，令$C(h_t)$表示用户在观察到$h_t$之后继续停留在会话中的随机事件，则$h_t$的continuing probability，记为$c(h_t)$，就是事件$C(h_t)$在$h_t$下发生的概率。

显然，对于任意item page history $h$，都有$c(h) = 1 - b(h) - l(h)$成立。特殊地，对于初始item page history $h_0$来讲，$C(h_0)$是一个必然事件（即$c(h_0) = 1$）。这是因为在第一个item page展示给用户前，不可能存在成交转化事件和离开事件。 

基于上面定义的几个概念，我们可以定义search session MDP（SSMDP）如下：定义7. [Search Session MDP] 令$q$为某个query，$\mathcal{D}$为和$q$相关的商品全集，$K$为一个页面可展示的商品数量，关于$q$、$\mathcal{D}$和$K$的search session MDP是一个元组，记为$\mathcal{M} = \langle T, \mathcal{H}, \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{P} \rangle$。该元组中的每个要素分别为：

$$ \mathcal{P}(C(h_t), a, s') = \left\{ \begin{aligned} &b(h_{t+1}) &\text{if } s' = B(h_{t+1}), \\ &l(h_{t+1}) &\text{if } s' = L(h_{t+1}), \\ &c(h_{t+1}) &\text{if } s' = C(h_{t+1}), \\ &0 &\text{otherwise.} \end{aligned} \right. $$

在一个search session MDP中，环境即是所有可能用户共同构成的总体，环境的状态表征了用户总体在对应item page history下的动向（继续会话、成交或离开）。环境状态的转移则直接基于我们之前定义的conversion probability、abandon probability以及continuation probability。奖赏函数$\mathcal{R}$可以根据具体的业务目标进行定义。基于让天下没有难做的生意的使命，也就是尽可能多地促进用户与卖家之间的交易，我们给出如下的奖赏函数范例。对于任意时间步$t$（$0 \leq t < T$）、任意item page history $h_t \in \mathcal{H}_t$和任意动作$a \in \mathcal{A}$，令$h_{t+1} = (h_t, \mathcal{L}_K(\mathcal{D}_t, a))$，则agent在状态$C(h_t)$上执行动作$a$并且环境转移到任意状态$s' \in \mathcal{S}$的奖赏为

$$ \mathcal{R}(C(h_t), a, s') = \left\{ \begin{aligned} &m(h_{t+1}) &\text{ if } s' = B(h_{t+1}), \\ &0 &\text{otherwise,} \quad\quad \end{aligned} \right. $$

其中，$m(h_{t+1})$表示item page history $h_{t+1}$对应的成交均价。



$$ \text{Pr}(s_t | s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, ..., s_{t-1}, a_{t-1}) = \text{Pr}(s_t | s_{t-1}, a_{t-1}). $$

也即是说，当前状态$s_t$的发生概率仅仅取决于最近一个状态动作对$(s_{t-1}, a_{t-1})$，而并非整个序列。我们可以证明对于一个SSMDP，它的所有状态都具有马尔可夫性质。

命题1. 对于任意search session MDP $\mathcal{M} = \langle T, \mathcal{H}, \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{P} \rangle$，其状态空间$\mathcal{S}$中的任意状态都具有马尔可夫性质。证明:我们只需证明对于任意时间步$t$ ($0 \leq t \leq T$)和关于$t$的任意状态动作序列$s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, ..., s_{t-1}, a_{t-1}, s_t$，都有等式$\text{Pr}(s_t | s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, ..., s_{t-1}, a_{t-1}) = \text{Pr}(s_t | s_{t-1}, a_{t-1})$成立即可。

除了状态$s_t$以外，序列$s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, ..., s_{t-1}, a_{t-1}, s_t$中的其他所有状态都是非终止状态（non-terminal state）。根据状态的定义，对于任意时间步$t'$ ($0 < t' < t$)，必然存在一个item page history $h_{t'}$与状态$s_{t'}$相对应，且有$s_{t'} = C(h(t'))$。因此，整个序列可以重写为$C(h_0), a_0, C(h_1), a_1, ..., C(h_{t-1}), a_{t-1}, s_t$。需注意的是，对于任意时间步$t' (0 < t' < t)$，都有

$$ h_{t'} = (h_{t' - 1}, \mathcal{L}_K(\mathcal{D}_{t'-1}, a_{t'-1})) $$

成立。其中，$\mathcal{L}_K(\mathcal{D}_{t'-1}, a_{t'-1})$也就是关于$(t'-1)$时刻的动作$a_{t'-1}$和未展示商品$\mathcal{D}_{t'-1}$的top $K$ list。给定$h_{t'-1}$， 集合$\mathcal{D}_{t'-1}$一定是确定的。所以，$h_{t'}$也就是状态动作对$(C(h_{t'-1}), a_{t'-1})$的必然和唯一结果。那么事件$(C(h_{t'-1}), a_{t'-1})$也就能够等价地表示为事件$h_{t'}$。基于此，我们可以进行如下推导：

$$ \begin{split} &\text{Pr}(s_t | s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, ..., s_{t-1}, a_{t-1}) \\ = &\text{Pr}(s_t | C(h_0), a_0, C(h_1), a_1, ..., C(h_{t-1}), a_{t-1}) \\ = &\text{Pr}(s_t | h_1, h_2, ..., h_{t-1}, C(h_{t-1}), a_{t-1}) \\ = &\text{Pr}(s_t | h_{t-1}, C(h_{t-1}), a_{t-1}) \\ = &\text{Pr}(s_t | C(h_{t-1}), a_{t-1}) \\ = &\text{Pr}(s_t | s_{t-1}, a_{t-1}). \end{split} $$ 

第三步推导成立是由于对于任意时间步$t'$ ($0 < t' < t$)，$h_{t'-1}$都包含在$h_{t'}$中。类似地，第四步推导成立是由于事件$C(h_{t-1})$已经包含了$h_{t-1}$的发生。



令$\mathcal{M} = \langle T, \mathcal{H}, \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{P} \rangle$为一个关于query $q$、商品全集$\mathcal{D}$和正整数$K$ ($K > 0$)的SSMDP。给定一个确定性策略$\pi : \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}$，记每个时间步$t$（$0 \leq t \leq T$）对应的item page history为$\pi$ by $h^{\pi}_t$，我们把在策略$\pi$下能够访问的所有状态都展示在图9中。





图9. Agent策略$\pi$下能够访问SSMDP中的所有状态

在这个图中，红色的节点表示item page history，注意它们并不是SSMDP的状态。方便起见，在本文接下来的部分，我们将把$C(h^{\pi}_t)$、$c(h^{\pi}_t)$、$b(h^{\pi}_t)$和$m(h^{\pi}_t)$分别简化记为$C^{\pi}_t$、$c^{\pi}_t$、$b^{\pi}_t$和$m^{\pi}_t$。

不失一般性，我们设SSMDP $\mathcal{M}$的折扣率为$\gamma$ ($0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$)。由于SSMDP是一个有限时间步MDP（finite-horizon MDP），所以折扣率可以取到1。对于任意时间步$t$（$0 \leq t < T$），状态$C^{\pi}_t$的state value为

$$ \begin{split} V^{\pi}_{\gamma}(C^{\pi}_t) &= \mathbb{E}^{\pi} \big\\{ \sum_{k=1}^{T-t} \gamma^{k-1} r_{t+k} \big| C^{\pi}_t \big\\} \\ &= \mathbb{E}^{\pi} \big\\{ r_{t+1} + \gamma r_{t+2} + \cdot\cdot\cdot + \gamma^{T-t-1} r_{T} \big| C^{\pi}_t \big\\}. \end{split} $$ 

其中，对任意$k$（$1 \leq k \leq T-t$），$r_{t+k}$为agent在未来时刻$(t+k)$的item page history $h^{\pi}_{t+k}$中收到的即时奖赏。根据我们奖赏函数的定义，$r_{t+k}$在策略$\pi$下的期望值为$\mathbb{E}^{\pi} \big\\{ r_{t+k} \big\\} = b^{\pi}_{t+k} m^{\pi}_{t+k}$。在这里，$m^{\pi}_{t+k} = m(h^{\pi}_{t+k})$为item page history $h^{\pi}_{t+k}$的成交价格期望。由于$V^{\pi}_{\gamma}(C^{\pi}_t)$表达的是在$C^{\pi}_t$发生的条件下的长期累积奖赏期望，所以我们还要把从$C^{\pi}_t$到达item page history $h^{\pi}_{t+k}$的概率考虑进来。记从状态$C^{\pi}_t$到达$h^{\pi}_{t+k}$的概率为$\text{Pr}( C^{\pi}_t \rightarrow h^{\pi}_{t+k})$，根据状态转移函数的定义可以得到

$$ \text{Pr}(C^{\pi}_t \rightarrow h^{\pi}_{t+k}) = \left\{ \begin{aligned} 1.0 &k = 1, \quad\quad\quad \\ \Pi^{k-1}_{j=1} c^{\pi}_{t+j} &1 < k \leq T-t. \end{aligned} \right. $$ 

从状态$C^{\pi}_t$到item page history $h^{\pi}_{t+1}$的概率为$1$是因为$h^{\pi}_{t+1}$是状态动作对$(C^{\pi}_t, \pi(C^{\pi}_t))$的直接结果。将上面的几个公式综合起来，我们可以进一步计算$V^{\pi}_{\gamma}(C^{\pi}_t)$如下：

$$ \begin{split} V^{\pi}_{\gamma}(C^{\pi}_t) &= \mathbb{E}^{\pi} \big\\{ r_{t+1} \big| C^{\pi}_t \big\\} + \gamma \mathbb{E}^{\pi} \big\\{r_{t+2} \big| C^{\pi}_t \big\\} + \cdot\cdot\cdot + \gamma^{T-t-1} \mathbb{E}^{\pi} \big\\{ r_{T} \big| C^{\pi}_t \big\\} \\ &= \sum^{T-t}_{k=1} \gamma^{k-1} \text{Pr}(C^{\pi}_t \rightarrow h^{\pi}_{t+k}) b^{\pi}_{t+k} m^{\pi}_{t+k} \\ &= b^{\pi}_{t+1} m^{\pi}_{t+1} + \gamma c^{\pi}_{t+1} b^{\pi}_{t+2} m^{\pi}_{t+2} + \cdot\cdot\cdot + \gamma^{T-t-1} \big( \Pi^{T-t-1}_{j=1} c^{\pi}_{t+j} \big) b^{\pi}_{T} m^{\pi}_{T} \\ &= b^{\pi}_{t+1} m^{\pi}_{t+1} + \sum^{T-t}_{k=2} \gamma^{k-1} \Big( \big( \Pi^{k-1}_{j=1} c^{\pi}_{t+j} \big) b^{\pi}_{t+k} m^{\pi}_{t+k} \Big). \end{split} $$

根据图9中展示的每个item page history的conversion probability以及成交价格期望，我们也可以将搜索引擎在策略$\pi$的作用下在一个搜索会话中引导的成交额期望表达出来，即

$$ \begin{split} \mathbb{E}^{\pi}_{gmv} &= b^{\pi}_{1} m^{\pi}_1 + c^{\pi}_1 b^{\pi}_2 m^{\pi}_2 + \cdot\cdot\cdot + \big( \Pi_{k=1}^{T} c^{\pi}_k \big) b^{\pi}_T m^{\pi}_T \\ &= b^{\pi}_{1} m^{\pi}_1 + \sum_{k=2}^{T} \big( \Pi_{j=1}^{k-1} c^{\pi}_j \big) b^{\pi}_k m^{\pi}_k. \end{split} $$ 

通过比较$\mathbb{E}_{gmv}$和$V^{\pi}_{\gamma}$，不难发现当折扣率$\gamma = 1$时，有$\mathbb{E}^{\pi}_{gmv} = V^{\pi}_{\gamma}(C^{\pi}_0)$成立。也就是说，当$\gamma = 1$时，最大化长期累积奖赏将直接带来搜索引擎成交额的最大化。当$\gamma < 1$时，由于$\mathbb{E}^{\pi}_{gmv}$是$V^{\pi}_{\gamma}(C^{\pi}_0)$的上界，所以最大化$V^{\pi}_{\gamma}$并不一定能够最大化$\mathbb{E}^{\pi}_{gmv}$。

命题2. 令$\mathcal{M} = \langle T, \mathcal{H}, \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{P} \rangle$为任意search session MDP。对于任意确定性策略$\pi : \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}$和折扣率$\gamma$（$0 \leq \gamma \leq 1$），都有式子$V^{\pi}_{\gamma}(C(h_0)) \leq \mathbb{E}^{\pi}_{gmv}$成立，其中$V^{\pi}_{\gamma}$为agent在策略$\pi$和折扣率$\gamma$下的状态值函数，$C(h_0)$为搜索会话的初始状态，$\mathbb{E}^{\pi}_{gmv}$为搜索引擎在策略$\pi$下的单次搜索会话成交额期望。仅当$\gamma = 1$时，有$V^{\pi}_{\gamma}(C(h_0)) = \mathbb{E}^{\pi}_{gmv}$成立。证明: 我们只需证明当$\gamma < 1$时，有$V^{\pi}_{\gamma}(C(h_0)) < \mathbb{E}^{\pi}_{gmv}$成立。这是显然的，因为二者之差，即$\sum_{k=2}^{T} (1 - \gamma^{k-1} ) \big( \Pi_{j=1}^{k-1} c^{\pi}_j \big) b^{\pi}_k m^{\pi}_k$在$\gamma < 1$时一定为正。

至此，我们可以回答之前提出的问题：站在提高搜索引擎成交额的角度，搜索排序问题中考虑延迟奖赏是必要且必须的。从理论上，这是因为最大化无折扣累积奖赏能够直接优化搜索引擎的成交额。究其深层原因，是因为用户在搜索商品的每个步骤（即每个item page history）的行为都是基于之前观察到的所有信息（或者大部分信息）作出的反应，这天然决定了搜索排序问题的sequential decision-making本质。



由于实验规模不大，我们可以直接用Tabular强化学习方法对问题进行求解。我们分别采用Q-learning算法、Actor-Critic方法和Dynammic Programming方法，在折扣率$\gamma$为$0$、$0.1$、$0.5$、$0.9$和$1.0$的情况下进行测试。每一个实验设置运行算法$50$次，每一次包含$80$万次搜索会话，我们记录下学习过程中每个搜索会话的平均成交额以及初始状态$h_0$的state value。这里仅给出部分结果。我们首先对比两个极端情况$\gamma=0$和$\gamma=1.0$时，每个算法取得的GMV指标。如图10所示，三个算法在$\gamma=1.0$时的GMV都要高于$\gamma=0$时的GMV。单看结果最直观的DP方法，可以发现它在两个折扣因子下的GMV有$6\%$的gap。如前所述，折扣因子$\gamma=0$即是分别独立优化Agent在每个状态上的即时奖赏，而$\gamma=1.0$则是直接优化GMV。





图10. $\gamma=0$和$\gamma=1$情况下测试算法的GMV曲线

我们选取Actor-Critic方法，考察它在不同折扣率下的GMV曲线以及初始状态$h_0$的state value $V_{\gamma}(h_0)$的变化情况，结果如图11所示。可以看到，Actor-Critic方法在不同折扣率下的GMV指标与图10的结果一致，而图右边的值函数变化曲线更直接证明我之前的理论分析。只有折扣因子$\gamma=1.0$时，$V_{\gamma}(h_0)$的值才和对应的GMV几乎相等。需要注意的是，Actor-Critic方法在$\gamma$等于$0.9$和$1.0$时的GMV曲线基本重合，并不能说明优化$V_{0.9}$能够优化GMV，而只能说明优化$V_{0.9}$与优化$V_{1.0}$得到的最优策略恰好相同，二者本质上并不一样。



图11. Actor-Critic方法在各个折扣率设置下的GMV曲线和值函数曲线

至此，我们已经通过理论分析和实验证明了搜索排序问题是一个有限时间步的无折扣（Finite-Horizon Undiscounted）的顺序决策问题。当然，我们所有的结论都是在以最大化成交额为目标的前提下得到的。如果追求点击率或者单纯转化率之类的目标，结论可能会有不同，但都可以采用与本文类似的方法进行分析。



通常来说，面对这样的大规模流量访问，当引擎的处理能力不足时，通常有2种做法：一种是算法端准备一个廉价的方案，去掉效果好但耗时高的因子，这个方案比最好的策略差很多，但是引擎肯定可以扛得住；另一种是引擎端执行临时性的降级方案，比如，下线不重要业务、减少召回数量、通过粗排过滤更多宝贝等方法。可以看到，不管哪一种，都是效果对性能的硬妥协（hard compromise），所以我们尝试问自己这样一个问题，can we make it softer, and smarter?

当然，答案是，完全有可能！实际上，当我们观察我们线上的排序因子，我们发现，即使每一个因子的上线初期都经过了A/B测试验证了其有效性，但总体来看，因子之间的相关性仍然很高，我们抽取了一个子集，计算了两两之间的皮尔逊积矩相关系数（Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient），如下图所示：





$$ \begin{align} F(u,q,d)=f\big(x_{1}(d),x_{2}(d),...,x_{n}(d)\big) \end{align} $$

值得指出的是，这里并没有对$f$的形式做任何假设，可以是一个线性模型，一个DNN网络，甚至是一个GBDT。

我们先考虑某一个特定context的优化，即对某个$(u,q)$表示，召回和海选之后还有m个商品待排序，我们可以使用全部的因子集合$\Omega$计算总得分$F_o=[f\big(s(d_1)),f(s(d_2)),...,f(s(d_m)\big)]$，亦选取一个子集$S \subset \Omega$，计算近似总得分$F_a=[f\big(\pi_S(s(d_1))),f(\pi_S(s(d_2))),...,f(\pi_S(s(d_m))\big)]$，这里的$\pi_S(\cdot)$指的是因子全集向子集的映射，于是我们的目标可以写成

$$ \begin{align} \min_{S \subset \Omega} \;\; D(F_o||F_a) + \lambda ||S||_0 \end{align} $$

这里$D(p||q)$表示的是KL距离，而目标中的第二项表示是子集的大小，目标的直觉含义是，在尽量用少的因子的情况下，最大可能的逼近原先的排序函数$F_o$。

然后，即使对单个context，Eq. (2) 都不是特别好解的问题，其本质上是一个optimal subset selection问题，可以证明是NP-Hard问题。换言之，我们要尝试对所有的$(u,q)$，都要分别求解一个NP-Hard问题，这显然是不现实的。解决这个问题的第一步，是把最优子集的解在context特征层上进行泛化，即我们不直接求解子集，而是通过定义：

$$ \begin{align} S_{u,q}=H(u,q|\theta) \end{align} $$

转而去求解一个全局的模型参数$\theta$。同时，在机器学习的多个子领域都有optimal subset selection的问题，例如feature selection，ensemble pruning等，其中不乏很多有效的启发式以及近似算法。受Google近年来的工作的启发（通过DRL求解TSP问题），我们将子集选取定义为一个最优决策序列，序列的奖赏，即reward，则可以定义为我们想要的metric，例如将我们的loss取反。



状态的定义是一个关键环节，在我们的方案中，我们将排序模型作为环境相应Agent的动作请求，而Agent通过转移状态和reward来决定下一次的动作。因此，如何设计状态等MDP的关键环节成为方案的核心。我们将一步一步展开我们的设计。









agent根据当前状态$s$, 做出决策，选择动作$a_k$；这时将动作$a_k$存储在$s^\prime$中，同时最后一维计数$k+1$。重复以上过程直到最后一维到达某个值。



$$ b(a_k) = \begin{cases} 0 &\text{if $a_k=$ Skip}\\ 1 &\text{if $a_k=$ Eval} \end{cases} $$

我们的主要目标是在保持排序的有效性（比如我们的方案是保持原有的序）的基础下，同时尽最大的可能减少feature的使用。所以我们的奖赏函数在鼓励减少使用Feature的同时，当排序结果太差的时候会给出一个惩罚 (penalty). 定义如下：

$$ T(s_k,a_k) = \begin{cases} r_{p} & t

其中，$t=\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}\sum_{k=1, k \neq j}^{n_i} \mathbf{1}_{\pi_{opt}}(\pi_i^{\mathbb{I}}(j)>\pi_{i}^{\mathbb{I}}(k))$定义了两个排序的pairwise loss。如果这个loss太大，超过某个阈值$C$, 就会触发一个很大的惩罚$r_{p}$使得agent减少drop feature的数量。然后我们在定义没有没有penalty的奖赏函数：

$$ \hat{R}(s_k,a_k) = \begin{cases} 0 &\text{if $a_k=$ Skip}\\ c_k^{i,j} &\text{if $a_k=$ Eval} \end{cases} $$

这里 $c_k^{i,j}$ 的feature $x^{i,j}_k$的计算开销函数. 直觉上,这个设计能更多的倾向于跳过高开销的feature。最后我们把上面两个函数联合起来，就得到了我们想要的最终奖赏函数：

$$ \mathcal{R}(s_k,a_k)=\hat{\mathcal{R}}(s_k,a_k)+\mathcal{T}(s_k,a_k). $$

这个函数设计既能达到节省性能开销，同时也能保证排序的有效性。



直觉上来讲，在原有学习的基础我们的目的是学习一个$b$向量，具体设定见下图：





$$ \mathcal{J}(\theta)=\mathbb{E}_{q_i}\left[\mathcal{L}(b(\theta);q_i, w^{q_i})\right], $$

这里$b(\theta)$ 是 $\theta\in \mathbb{R}^d$参数化的函数 $d>0$是参数向量的维度.我们重新将奖赏函数写为：

$$ \min\limits_{\theta} \frac{1}{|\mathcal{Q}|} \sum_{i=1}^{|\mathcal{Q}|} \left(-\mathcal{J}_{\mathcal{L}, \theta} \left(\tilde{\theta};q_i,w_i\right)+\mu\left\lVert \tilde{\theta}\right\rVert_1\right) $$

这里$\left\lVert \tilde{\theta}\right\rVert_1$ 是$L_1$泛数, $\mu$ 是正则参数，然后$$\mathcal{J}_{\mathcal{L}, \theta} \left(\tilde{\theta},p_i, w_i\right)=\int_{\tau} p_{\theta}(\tau) \mathcal{R}(\tau) \log \frac{p_{\tilde{\theta}}(\tau)}{p_{\theta}(\tau)} d \tau $$

$$ p_{\theta}(\tau) = p_{0}(s_{0}) \prod_{m=0}^{M-1} p\left(s_{m+1}\mid s_{m}, a_{m},q_i,w_i\right)\pi_{\tilde{theta}} (a_{m}\mid s_{m},q_i,w_i), \ \ \mathcal{R}(\tau) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=0}^{M} \gamma^m r_{m+1}, $$

这里$p_{\theta}(\tau) $是轨迹$\tau$出现的概率 ，$\pi$是我们的策略函数。











测试结果如下：

regular测试的时间主要是8月6日到11日，取一周通天塔报表均值。我们的测试桶与基准桶测试结果如下:



在双十一当天，我们也上线测试，与cascade learning 叠加测试 （详情请参阅这篇文章），在cascade learning节省30%的性能的基础上，再节省了20%的引擎性能开销。





事实上，今天的淘宝俨然已经成为了一个规模不小的经济体，因此，社会经济学里面讨论的问题，在我们这几乎无不例外的出现了。早期的淘宝多数是通过效率优先的方式去优化商品展示的模式，从而产生了给消费者最初的刻板印象：低价爆款，这在当时是有一定的历史局限性而产生的结果，但肯定不是我们长期希望看到的情形。因为社会大环境在变化，人们的消费意识也在变化，如果我们不能同步跟上，甚至是超前布局的话，就有可能被竞争对手赶上，错失良机。因此有了我们近几年对品牌的经营，对客单的优化，以至于现在再搜索“连衣裙”这样的词，也很难看到十几块包邮的商品，而这个在2,3年之前仍然是常态。而这里的品牌和客单等因素，是通过一系列的计划经济手段来进行干预的，类似于上文福利经济学第二定理中的禀赋分配，依据的是全局的的观察和思考，很难而且也不可能通过一个局部的封闭系统（例如搜索的排序优化器）来实现。

因此，越来越多的运营和产品同学，鉴于以上的思考，提出了很多干预的分层，这里的分层指的是商品/商家类型的划分，可以从不同的维度来划分，比如，按照对平台重要性将天猫商家划分成A,B,C,D商家；按照品牌影响力将商品划分为高调性和普通商品；按照价格将商品划分为高端、中等、低端商品等。而早期的算法同学对这些可能也不够重视，一个经典的做法即简单加权，这通常往往会带来效率上的损失，因此结果大多也是不了了之。但当我们认真审视这个问题的时候，我们其实可以预料，损失是必然的，因为一个纯粹的市场竞争会在当前的供需关系下逐步优化，达到一个局部最优，所以一旦这个局部最优点被一个大的扰动打破，其打破的瞬间必然是有效率损失的，但是其之后是有机会达到比之前的稳定点更优的地方。



所以，这其实给我们算法同学带来2个问题：

对应的解决方案也很自然：



$$ a^k = L^k + (U^k-L_k)o^k, \forall{k} \in \{1,2...,m\} $$

这里$U^k$和$L_k$是第k维分层rank feature的权重的upper bound和low bound，一般来自于领域知识，但通常受限于经验的局限，因此我们尝试了一种新的方法进行自动赋值，将在下一节进行阐述。

$$ r(s,a) = \text{GMV}(n_{click},n_{cart},n_{buy}) + \sum_i^m \lambda_i \big(p_i(\pi)-p_i(\pi_{basic})\big) $$



针对以上2个问题，我们设计了一个通过Cross Entropy Method（CEM）的方法来实时的动态更新action的upper bound和low bound，具体而言，我们不考虑state，考虑一个全局最优action$a_k$，我们假设其符合一个高斯分布，在

$$ a^{k*} \in N(\mu_k, \sigma_k^2) $$

每次迭代的开始，我们从这个分布上采样s个样本，即$\Omega_1,\Omega_2,...,\Omega_s$，然后对这些action进行充分的投放，得到对应的action的一个充分置信的reward值，即

$$ R(\Omega_1)= \frac{1}{N_1} \sum_i^{N_1} r_i(\Omega_1) \\ R(\Omega_2)= \frac{1}{N_2} \sum_i^{N_2} r_i(\Omega_2) \\ \cdot \cdot \cdot \\ R(\Omega_s)= \frac{1}{N_s} \sum_i^{N_s} r_i(\Omega_s) $$

然后我们对$R(\Omega_1),R(\Omega_2),...,R(\Omega_s)$进行排序，选取出top p的子集D，以最大化高斯分布产生这些样本的概率，即

$$ \max_{\mu_k^*, \sigma_k^{2*}} \;\;\; f(\mu_k^*, \sigma_k^{2*}) = \sum_{i \in D} \log N(\Omega_i|\mu_k^*, \sigma_k^{2*}) $$

实际上，上面的式子是有最优解的，$\mu_k^*$即D中所有样本的均值，$ \sigma_k^{2*}$则是所有样本的方差，但如果直接求解，则模型则会迭代过快，一方面会完全忘记之前迭代的信息，另一方面，因为这个会直接输出给上面的RL学习的actor使用，所以bound不能变化多块，否则RL很有可能不能及时跟上变化，因此，我们采用了缓慢更新的方法，即

$$ \mu_k \leftarrow \mu_k + \alpha \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mu_k} \\ \sigma_k \leftarrow \sigma_k + \alpha \frac{\partial f}{\partial \sigma_k } $$

在更新之后，我们使用下面的方法赋值第k维action的upper bound和low bound，确保RL调节的action在一个全局较优的空间内

$$ L^k = \mu_k - 2\sigma_k \\ U^k = \mu_k + 2\sigma_k \\ $$

我们的RL实现选择了我们自己在AI4B中实现的DDPG，整体流程如下：









构建一个“淘宝模拟器”会使得问题变得简单。在模拟器上，策略探索的几乎没有成本，并且可以快速进行策略评估。如果有了这样一个模拟器，就可以对各种RL算法进行离线尝试。





这种简单的方式不是很奏效，原因是数据分布高度依赖于当时的线上策略，导致数据会很不充分，这样由于方差漂移（covariate shift）带来的compounding error会使得算法失效。







$$ r_u(s,a) = 1 \text{ 如果购买行为发生，否则 } 0 $$

我们用${e}$表示用户环境，$s_e \in \mathcal{S}_e$, $a_e \in \mathcal{A}_e$, $\pi_e(a_e|\,s_e)\in\mathbf{R}$, $r(s_e,a_e)\in\mathbf{R}$ 表示其对应的状态、动作、策略、奖励函数。其中，$s_e = [s_u, a_u]$， $a_e = r_u$。我们要从历史数据$\{s_u,a_u,s_e\}$中学习出环境的策略$\pi_e$。在逆强化学习的框架下，我们只需要学得“专家策略”的奖赏函数$r_e$即可。为了更多地探索，我们假设事先并不知道$\pi_u$。于是我们用 $\pi(a_u,a_e|\,s_u)$表示一种‘联合策略’，即给定$s_u$的情况下，依次使用$\pi_u$, $\pi_e$，得到$a_u,a_e$。

# 爱情的定义是什么 爱TA和享受爱情的区别_手机新浪网

你是否有过明明爱着对方，却总觉得感情间少了点什么的感受？ 有人说爱一个人不过就是我们自己的选择；也有人认为，当你爱一个人的时候，那种感情是不由自主、自然而然就发生了。 如果是这样，那可能是由于‘爱一个人’和‘沉浸在爱之中’的微妙差异。下面的分析也许能帮助你更了解自己的爱情，而那种‘少了点什么’的想法便能豁然开朗。

‘我是在去年和前男友分开的。有天早上醒来后我突然发现自己无法再继续下去了。我非常尊重身旁的这个男人，也很信任他，我甚至认为自己很爱他，但却不觉得自己沉浸在爱的感受之中。’

这种感觉相信很多情侣都会感觉到。也许是某个话题的讨论上，他的回应让你感觉到。也许是他什么也没做，你就如此感觉。也许是某个无言的瞬间，你会觉得，你已经从爱中清醒。

爱他和享受爱情的区别：

当你‘爱一个人’时，对于他的热情所在你会给予支持；

当你‘沉浸在爱之中’，不只是支持，你会把他追求热情的那份渴望当作是自己的，甚至和他抱有相同的渴望。

当你‘爱一个人’时，你会和他分享自己的想法；

当你‘沉浸在爱之中’，不只是想法上的分享，无论你去到哪，看见什么，他都会是那个你想到的人。

当你‘爱一个人’时，在他的拥抱中你会感到温暖；

当你‘沉浸在爱之中’，拥抱能温暖你，同时你会渴望自己也能做些什么，希望能为他带来同样愉悦的感受。

也许是对爱情的幻想局限了爱情的发展

为什么会这样？去爱一个人，其实并不难，难的是这份感情有没有让你们双方都觉得不可理喻的幸福，不是热恋期的那种盲目，而是长期关系中，即便经历了各种糟糕的事，却依旧想和对方长相厮守的感受，因为‘你就是他，他就是你’。很多幸福的感受其实都是人类附加的想象，也因此我们时常被自己给迷惑，当你选择去爱一个人时，他对你的所作所为很容易就能让你感到快乐，但快乐不等于满足，满足来自于彼此沉浸在爱之中时的感受，如何洞悉自己的想法，是在爱情中学会让自己更好的关键之一。

让我们享受恋爱吧

在恋爱中，有人觉得“和彼此喜欢的人在一起，每天都很幸福！”，但也有人觉得“虽然有喜欢的人但是处理不好两个人的关系，即使交往了也会马上分手”。虽然外表和性格的磨合很重要，但要意识到这些并行动起来，首先还是要学会享受恋爱啊。让我们一起学起来吧。

学会“精明”

女孩子就算有了男朋友也会继续和其他异性朋友接触的。虽然不会让男朋友看到，但是自己也打着小算盘吧，一想到没有“备胎”就暗自着急，所以即使觉得现在的男朋友不好也不会分手啊。

“精明”这个词听起来可能给人带来不好的印象，但在恋爱中却是至关重要的一点。

虽有男朋友但也会和其他异性保持良好关系，将其作为 “备胎”对象，这样的女人就能称为“精明”的女人。当然，这种精明不是鼓励在和男朋友在一起的时候发展备胎，这样的行为就是另外一种意义的出轨了。

并不执着于一个男人，两人关系破裂之后，也不会表现出“绝对不要分手！”这样卑微的姿态，而是马上投入到下一场恋爱中，像这样的女人就很少会在恋爱中失败。

用积极的态度投入

“我觉得享受恋爱的女孩子对待恋爱都很积极。她们感觉犹豫不决就是在浪费时间。只是一味等待的话，很少会有男性主动接触自己，女孩子们不积极一点的话还是不能和喜欢的那个“他”在一起的。”（23岁/秘书）

“喜欢对自己有好感的男性”“自己绝不会主动的”这样的女人可能会错失良机哦。有些女性虽然跟主动向自己告白的男性交往了，但是对方却不是自己想要常伴左右的伴侣，因此很难得到幸福。另外有些男性会觉得如果女方总是处于被动地位的话会很无趣，这样的男性即使主动接近，也会不久就又离开。

给予对方充分的信任

有些人即使在交往也不能信任对方，一发生什么事情就担心对方是不是出轨了，这样真的很累。如果对方不足以信任的话，还是别在一起的好。

总是对对方细小的举动疑神疑鬼，别说是享受恋爱了，一个人独处的时间都会受到影响。能完全的信任对方，没有疑心，不让对方反感，这样才能共筑良好的恋爱关系。

不惧怕分手

一个人也能过得很好，很享受一个人的时光。正因为这样才不会缠着他吧，怎么说呢，就是完全没有“他不在就不行”的想法。我们可以注意到越是依赖男朋友的人，越会束缚着彼此而导致矛盾。从这一点来看的话，交往起来也比较轻松。退一万步来说，如果他真的要有什么背叛的行为，依赖和盯人是不能预防的。

因为孤单所以想找个男朋友”，抱着这种想法的女性，一旦有了男朋友就容易对他产生依赖。从男性的角度来说，这样的女性会让人感觉过于沉重。一个人也挺快乐的，但是有男朋友的话这种快乐会加倍的。男性觉得和有这种想法的女性在一起会比较开心。

有时候，沉浸在爱河中的状态可能不是努力就能得到，不过，积极投入恋爱是每一个人都能做到的。既然要恋爱，为何不好好享受呢？

爱情的定义是什么？



爱情？就像咖啡，苦中带甜，悠然自得。它是一种相互的理解，一种无言的默契，一种无论身处何方的牵挂。我定义的爱情，是每一个微小的瞬间，是每一个深深的呼吸，是每一个会心的微笑。它就像我身边的他，陪我笑，陪我泣，陪我共度人生。爱，就是在忙碌的生活中找到宁静的角落，彼此分享快乐和痛苦，让彼此成为生活中的一部分。这就是我对爱情的理解。



在爱情的世界中，每个人都在追求真挚的情感。爱情的甜蜜与苦涩犹如咖啡的味道，让人无法抗拒。真正美好的爱情需要相互理解和默契，需要共同经历人生的高低起伏，需要在日常琐事中相互扶持。爱情并非闪耀的烟火，而是一段相互陪伴的长久旅程。

在这个过程中，我们会经历许多微小的瞬间，例如深呼吸和会心微笑，这些瞬间是爱情不可或缺的组成部分。当我们在繁忙的生活中找到爱情的宁静角落，成为对方生命中不可或缺的一部分，我们的爱情变得更珍贵而深刻。让我们一起珍惜，用心感受爱情的美好，让它成为我们生命中最闪耀的宝石。

# 揭秘！究竟什么是爱情呢？_社会_关系_情感

爱情是人类最为纯粹、神秘和矛盾的情感之一。它是一种不可抗拒的欲望，能够超越时间、空间、文化和种族的界限，让人们感受到生命的深邃和意义。无论是在众人瞩目的风光旁，还是在平凡生活的日子里，爱情的存在都能够让我们感受到生命的光芒和美好。

本文将通过分析爱情的本质及其内在特点，探讨彼此相爱、彼此依靠的情感力量，以期引导读者进一步思考和探索。

定义性的爱情

爱情是每个人生命中最珍贵的情感之一，可以让人感到快乐、幸福和满足。爱情有许多不同的定义和形式，最为普遍的是定义性的爱情。

定义性的爱情是一种深厚的感情，两个人在一起，通过探索彼此的优点、缺点和价值观来建立起强大的关系。这种爱情是基于两个人之间的共同利益和相互的尊重，不是单方面的欣赏或迷恋。



相比其他类型的爱情，定义性的爱情更加健康和稳定。在这种爱情中，双方建立了真正的联系，并建立了更深层次的沟通和理解。两个人都非常努力地经营这种关系，它是持久的，能够在时间的考验中继续发展。

定义性的爱情也是基于共同的目标。两个人分享彼此的喜好和兴趣，还分享彼此的梦想和愿景。他们双方都为了实现这个共同目标而不懈努力，并相互支持和鼓励。

定义性的爱情是基于相互尊重和接受。两个人都能够尊重和接受对方的个性、信仰和思想，感激彼此的独特之处。使他们克服任何困难和差异，创造一个健康的、恒久的关系。

这种爱情是基于共同的目标和价值观，给人带来深刻的幸福和满足感。两个人可以相互分享彼此的喜悦和成功，共同经历生活中的美好时光。



定义性的爱情是健康的。两个人相互尊重和接受对方，他们不会试图改变对方或将其转变为自己想要的样子。他们会欣赏彼此的独特性，在这种共同的欣赏中建立起强大的连接。他们可以更好地应对日常生活中的压力和挑战。

定义性的爱情是持久的。两个人共享一个目标，为之而努力，他们能够在任何困难和磨合期中保持良好的关系。这种爱情能够抵抗时间的考验，持续并不断发展。

定义性的爱情是基于共同目标、相互尊重和接受的一种健康、持久的关系。可以给人带来幸福和满足，使人能够更好地应对生活中的挑战，与伴侣共同经历生活的美好时光。无论是在个人关系还是婚姻中，定义性的爱情都是非常重要的。

心理学上的爱情

心理学上的爱情，是人类内心最深处的情感体验。爱情是人类的本能驱动，也是我们生命中最珍贵、最强烈的情感之一。无论是热烈的激情还是深沉的陪伴，爱情都在我们的生命中扮演着至关重要的角色。



爱情的起源与发展，是一个充满谜团的问题。人类一直在思考：爱情是天生的，还是后天培养出来的？爱情是一种渴望亲密关系的情感，是人的情感需要的一部分。

当两个人彼此相识，相互了解时，爱情就悄然萌芽了。爱情的起源在于两个人的相互吸引。这种吸引基于许多因素的，包括形象、性格、共同的经历和经验、社交背景等。外观还是性格，相互吸引的人都会发现对方吸引人的地方是否定的。

爱情的过程，从相知相识到相互依赖，最终演化成不可分割的心理合并。在这个过程中，信任、忠诚和支持起到了至关重要的作用。爱情需要无条件的支持和付出，这也是爱情最宝贵的一部分。在相互信任、相互扶持的基础上，爱情不断升华，变得越来越美好。

爱情并不只有美好的一面。爱情也会带来许多困难和痛苦。分别、不信任、欺骗、甚至背叛，都可以给恋爱带来许多负面的影响。这个时刻需要的是理智地看待问题，寻求某种解决方案，相信这个方案也一定会让两人之间的关系更加坚如磐石。



在爱情中最重要的是相互理解和支持。两个人真心彼此相爱，爱情能够取得最终的胜利。要爱情变得更美好，学会珍惜对方，理解对方，和谐相处，无微不至地照顾对方。付出才是真正的爱情，也是美好生命的最大幸福。

爱情不可能有标准答案，也不会按照某种固定的方式运转。只要真心投入，相互支持，共同面对生活中的一切挑战，爱情必将变得更加美好和坚实。在繁忙而忙碌的现代社会中，唯有相互的关爱和支持才能真正带来幸福和满足感，真实的爱情，才能让我们生命更加充实和美好。

社会和文化对爱情的影响

爱情是人类最为深刻、最为复杂的情感之一，既是人类生存和繁衍的基础，同时也是人类最为痛苦和愉悦的情感之一。社会和文化对爱情的影响是多方面的，决定了人们的恋爱方式、观念和态度，也制约了恋爱行为的规范和规则。



社会和文化对恋爱方式、观念和态度有着深刻的影响。在现代社会中，个人创造自己的婚姻和恋爱关系的自由度越来越高，社会和文化不断地塑造和定型我们的恋爱观念。

在传统社会中，婚姻和恋爱关系是由父母和长辈“牵线搭桥”，婚姻以家庭利益和社会地位为重，恋爱的重要性相对较小。在现代社会中，个人价值和自由成为社会重视的焦点，很多地区已经出现了自由恋爱、早婚晚婚等各种方式。个人主义思想和个体自由成为了影响恋爱关系的主要因素。

社会和文化对恋爱规范和规则的制约也起到了重要作用。在传统社会中，婚姻和恋爱规则非常严格，包括强制性结婚年龄、婚前性行为禁止、结婚对象受到家长和社会地位等多方面的限制和规定。

恋爱关系和结婚关系具有更为稳定的特征。在现代社会，异性交往开放、性交易、婚外情等现象时有发生，社会和文化的日益开放也在某种程度上放宽了人们对婚姻和恋爱关系的规范和限制。



在一些消费主义和个人主义思潮盛行的地区，婚姻和恋爱关系受到的压力和限制更加缓和，追求感情和个人价值成为了恋爱关系的重点。

社会和文化对爱情的影响并不是唯一且独立的，与个体在社会中的身份和地位息息相关。对于穷人和富人、城市人和农村人、青年人和老年人等，恋爱规则和态度也存在着显著差异。在当前全球化的时代，传统文化和新型文化的融合和碰撞使得社会和文化对恋爱的影响更加的复杂和变幻莫测。

社会和文化对爱情的影响非常深刻而又复杂，人们理解和掌握爱情关系的基础。认真思考和分析社会和文化对爱情关系的作用和影响，依据自己的实际情况选择恰当的恋爱方式、观念和态度，以实现个人和社会的共赢。

爱情是一种能够让人感受到深刻情感和灵魂共鸣的情感体验，它是一种超越个人利益和理性的跨越性情感。它是一种相互依存和相互支持的关系，它可以给人带来不可思议的喜悦和满足感，也可以让人感到痛苦和受伤。但不管怎样，在爱情面前，人们总是愿意无限付出，无论是时间、精力、感情甚至是财富。



爱情是一个深奥的话题，每个人都有自己的理解和感受，无法找到通用的定义。爱情是一种美好的情感，带来的是无限的温暖和幸福感。在这个充满变数的现代社会中，爱情被现实和理性所淹没。

爱情或许不可能完美，却是值得我们珍惜和追求的东西。用心去把握爱情的真谛，永远不要轻视和辜负它，真正懂得珍惜和感恩的人，才能够在人生的道路上找到属于自己的终极幸福。

在一些消费主义和个人主义思潮盛行的地区，婚姻和恋爱关系受到的压力和限制更加缓和，追求感情和个人价值成为了恋爱关系的重点。

社会和文化对爱情的影响并不是唯一且独立的，与个体在社会中的身份和地位息息相关。对于穷人和富人、城市人和农村人、青年人和老年人等，恋爱规则和态度也存在着显著差异。在当前全球化的时代，传统文化和新型文化的融合和碰撞使得社会和文化对恋爱的影响更加的复杂和变幻莫测。

社会和文化对爱情的影响非常深刻而又复杂，人们理解和掌握爱情关系的基础。认真思考和分析社会和文化对爱情关系的作用和影响，依据自己的实际情况选择恰当的恋爱方式、观念和态度，以实现个人和社会的共赢。

爱情是一种能够让人感受到深刻情感和灵魂共鸣的情感体验，它是一种超越个人利益和理性的跨越性情感。它是一种相互依存和相互支持的关系，它可以给人带来不可思议的喜悦和满足感，也可以让人感到痛苦和受伤。但不管怎样，在爱情面前，人们总是愿意无限付出，无论是时间、精力、感情甚至是财富。



爱情是一个深奥的话题，每个人都有自己的理解和感受，无法找到通用的定义。爱情是一种美好的情感，带来的是无限的温暖和幸福感。在这个充满变数的现代社会中，爱情被现实和理性所淹没。

爱情或许不可能完美，却是值得我们珍惜和追求的东西。用心去把握爱情的真谛，永远不要轻视和辜负它，真正懂得珍惜和感恩的人，才能够在人生的道路上找到属于自己的终极幸福。

也许很多人无法分辨喜欢和爱，觉得这两个词的含义是大同小异，如果你这样想就错了。喜欢只是对一个人或者某样事物的心动，就是有情感上的触动和感觉；爱则是对一个人或者某样事物发自内心的喜欢，是一种刻骨铭心的喜欢，可以为了对方甘愿付出自己的所有，只是为了博得红颜一笑。

喜欢一个人和爱一个人在本质上，是有很大的区别的。当你看到莫个人产生好感，喜欢上了她，你会不由自主做出亲近她的行为举止。你愿意去接近她，了解她，但是一旦发生什么事情的时候，你可以随时抽身离开，并不会引起你内心多大的触动，顶多就是难过一阵子。爱一个人，你就会想时时刻刻和她在一起。无论是在你工作忙碌的时候，还是在你有空余闲暇时间的时候，一想到她，你的内心就会一片柔软。即使你是一个钢铁五尺男儿，你的心也会柔软地一塌糊涂，整个胸腔都被她占据了，她就是你心中的女神！



喜欢和爱有什么区别？通常通过以下三种表现，你就可以判断你们两个人之间的感情属于哪一种？

1、喜欢只是心动，爱则是行动

每个人一生当中，可以遇到很多自己喜欢的人或者事物。比如你看到花园里一朵娇艳欲滴含苞怒放的玫瑰花，因为喜欢，你忍不住动手把它摘了下来。带回家以后，把它插在花瓶里，欣赏了几天以后，花枯萎了，你随手就把它丢弃了。而另一个真正爱这朵玫瑰花的人，因为他发自内心的喜欢这朵玫瑰花，也就是说喜欢的程度不一样，是一个真正爱花的人。他不愿意也不舍得去摘下这朵玫瑰花，他每天用心拿水去浇灌这朵玫瑰花，尽可能地延长这朵玫瑰花的生命和花期，让它的美丽可以绽放地更加长久。

就像一个女孩子她同时遇到了两个追求者，她觉得他们两个人都很好，不知道如何选择。一个每天都会早安晚安问候不断，感觉他是一个对感情很认真，而且也愿意投入感情的人；另一个追求者则是一个不善言辞，为人比较木讷内向的人。他平时很少说什么甜蜜的话语，但是只要有事情，他就会第一时间来到女孩的身边，帮她解决问题和困难。有一次女孩子感冒生病了，没有去公司上班。那个每天早晚问候的男生知道她生病了，立刻殷勤地打电话发信息过来，让女生多休息多喝水，然后就没有下文了。而那个木讷的男孩子知道她生病了没有上班，立刻下班后就去买了感冒药，连夜赶去女孩家，督促她把感冒药喝了。女孩最终选择了这个用行动来表达爱的男生，因为这才是真正的爱，愿意为对方付出，即使辛劳而不求回报。



2、喜欢是一时的感觉，爱则是一生的拥有

我们会在某一个特定的时刻，喜欢上某一个人或者事物，一旦脱离开那个环境，我们很快就会把这段感情忘却。例如很多人说旅行容易发生艳遇，容易找到爱情，但是也有可能只是一次爱情的快餐。一个人外出旅行，特别是对于单身的男女，如果你是一个思想相对Openging的人，确实很容易发生艳遇。因为人是属于群居动物，当他长期在一个人孤单寂寞的生活状态下，恰巧遇到了一个谈得来有感觉的人，两个人可能很快就产生了感情。但是这种感情来的快去的也快，随着旅程的结束，两个人很快回归到现实生活中，就会去权衡利弊这段感情的得与失。

喜欢一个人，你可以随时放手：爱一个人，你却希望这辈子永远牵住她的手，不离不弃。喜欢只是一时的心动，爱则是爱到骨子里，不愿放弃只想拥有她的感情。就像小孩子喜欢玩玩具一样，他可以今天玩积木，明天玩挖土机，随时可以更换，只要有玩具玩就可以了。爱一个人，则是把自己的感情全部托付出去，希望能够让对方幸福，希望得到对方的回应，希望可以一辈子拥有她，这辈子都不愿意分开。余生只想执子之手与子偕老，和你在一起的日子，就是最好的日子。我的人生因为遇到了你，才充满了爱的光芒幸福的光辉。

3、喜欢是可以替代的，爱则是全身心的投入

喜欢只是感情的其中一种表达方式，就是爱的深度不一样。就像很多人喜欢追星，他们可能今天喜欢这个明星，明天又喜欢另一个明星，就是感情很容易转变。但是大家对自己身边的爱人却不一样，因为她是自己的终身伴侣，所以感情可以长期持久稳定的维持下去。当然随着时间的流逝，可能感情会慢慢就过渡成了左手握右手的样子。爱情变成了亲情，彼此对对方的爱早已渗入进了彼此的身心，都已成为对方生命中的一部分。

爱人这个词是很神圣的，不要轻易谈爱，谈了就不要轻易分开。就像父爱，母爱，爱情，都是彼此渗透进了对方的生活里或生命中，是双方不可缺少的一部分。彼此之间都有对对方感情的依赖，愿意把自己所拥有的东西提供给对方，无论是金钱还是感情。只要看到对方欢快愉悦的笑脸，自己就满心欢喜非常满足。

一个走肾一个走心，喜欢是有底线的。出于客观或者主观原因，，你会主动放弃她。但是爱不同，你会为了她一次次放弃自己的底线。喜欢是索取和占有，而爱却是付出与长久。

如果在你的生命里，遇到了一个爱你宠你到骨子里的人，他愿意把自己所拥有的一切都给你。往后余生他只想和你一起走，一起经历人生的风风雨雨，无论是苦还是甜，他都愿意和你一起分享。也许他不会对你说什么甜言蜜语，但是无论他身在何处，他总是牵挂着你，他对你所有的爱都是用行动实实在在的表现出来。如果你遇到了一个这样对你的人，你就好好珍惜吧！不要再瞻前顾后了，往后或许再也遇不到比他更好的了。

怎么判断喜欢和爱的区别

印象中每次恋爱，说喜欢总会脱口而出，说爱似乎次数少之又少。我们很少会去特别认真的权衡两者的区别，却也会在日常中本能的分开。

我想，一份感情起初是喜欢，能长久在一起才是爱。喜欢是刹那瞬间的感觉，爱一定是经历时间的沉淀。而那种一开始就说爱不爱的，真的没必要太在意。



好的感情或许没必要去纠结是喜欢还是爱，两个人多点理解，多点包容，一起把心动的喜欢变成心安的爱，那或许就是最好的恋爱吧。

喜欢一个人很容易，努力爱一个人却很难。度过热恋期，就更应该让爱情变成亲情，让吸引变成彼此的依赖。按部就班于生活里的平平淡淡，也要努力让生活和感情有仪式感，有归属感。新鲜感永远都会存在，可责任感更应该束缚我们敬畏缘分，敬畏爱情。

这要看你想在这段感情里付出，还是想在这段感情里索取。

在一段两个人的恋情当中，真正的爱情是想为了那个人付出，想用自己的付出让对方幸福，在付出的同时得到对方的反馈，这才是幸福。

如果仅仅是欲望，那你在感情中就只想索取，哪怕对方已经付出了一切，你还是会觉得不够。

爱情是真诚的付出与回馈，是真心的希望对方能幸福。在一段感情生活当中，如果你真的喜欢一个人，你会特别在乎他的主观感受。

她的一颦一笑、一举一动，都会在你心里引起很大的反响。你害怕对方不开心，你害怕对方不快乐，你害怕你的付出不足够让对方幸福，你更害怕就这样失去对方。

内心的这种患得患失会让人付出的更频繁，付出的更多一些。我们是真的希望另一半能幸福，哪怕在时光中与我走散，也希望他能继续幸福下去。



怎么判断喜欢和爱？

喜欢一朵花，会摘下来，插在瓶里，枯萎了就丢掉，去摘下一朵。

爱一朵花，想好好呵护，除虫浇水，阳光雨露，盼它开的持久，即使谢了也能重开。

二十四节气

是中国人独有的浪漫与诗意

在天地万物的细节里

它们记录了光阴的故事

山川花鸟的万物情长

让在山南旅游的你

能清晰地感知到

在山南的四季中

雨水泛起的氤氲、花开的暗香盈盈

雪花纷飞的情意浓浓...... 

感受日月星辰的魅力

# 男人喜欢一个人，和爱一个人的区别_手机搜狐网

你分析得非常到位，确实在爱情中，男人对一个人的喜欢和爱是有着本质区别的。

喜欢往往是一时的冲动和表面的吸引，它可能源自于对方的外貌、性格或者某个瞬间的共鸣。这种喜欢可能会因为时间、距离或者新的吸引点的出现而逐渐消散。



而爱则是深入内心的情感，它基于更深的了解和共鸣。当一个男人真正爱上一个女人时，他会愿意为她付出一切，包括时间、精力甚至牺牲自己的利益。他会把对方放在心中最重要的位置，关心她的喜怒哀乐，愿意与她共度一生。



在爱情中，区分喜欢和爱是非常重要的。喜欢可能只是短暂的欢愉，而爱则是长久的陪伴和承诺。因此，对于女性来说，要理智地看待男人对自己的感情，不要轻易被一时的喜欢所迷惑，而要学会识别真正的爱情。



同时，也要珍惜那些真正爱自己的人，因为他们愿意与你共度人生的风雨，共同创造美好的未来。
